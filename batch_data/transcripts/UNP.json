Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific first quarter 2014 conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn to introduce your host Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may now begin. John Koraleski : Thanks, Robin, good morning everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of marketing and sales, Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning we\u2019re pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2013 and another all-time quarter record. Total volumes were up 5% and the increase was broad-based. We saw growth in five of our six business groups with particular strength in agricultural shipments, industrial products and coal. The volume growth combined with solid core pricing and a continued focus on safety service and efficiency drove a 2 point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 67.1% for the quarter. As you all know this winter was one for the record but especially in the upper Midwest. So we're proud of the efforts of the men and women of the Union Pacific who worked tirelessly to serve our customers despite these weather challenges and helped us to achieve a solid start to the year. So with that let's get into it. I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric Butler :  Thanks Jack, and good morning. In the first quarter volume was up 5% compared to 2013 as solid demand made up for the challenging weather conditions in much of the country. We had strong grains in agricultural products, industrial products and coal. We also saw volume growth in the automotive and in chemicals we were able to offset declines in crude oil with gains in other commodities to end up even with last year\u2019s strong first quarter results. Corporate improved 2% which was partially offset by unfavourable mix and lower fuel prices to produce a 1% improvement in average revenue per car add in our volume growth and we increased freight revenue by 6% to a first quarter record of $5.3 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. At products volume grew 13%, which combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car throws revenue growth up 16%. We continue to see strong demand for grain with carloadings up 39% driven by last year's strong harvest. The biggest gains were in grain exports to China and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf. And lower corn prices drove increased demand for domestic feed grains. Grain product volume was up 5%, driven by the 11% increase in ethanol shipments as refineries replenish low ethanol inventories. Shipment to BBG's grew 38%, driven by strong export demand primarily from China. Food and repurchase shipments were down 3% for the quarter as the winter weather impact the cycle times for equipment serving the produce and frozen food markets. Partially offsetting those declines were gains in import beer where volume grew 3%. Automotive volume grew 2%, though average revenue per car was down 2% resulting in flat revenue for the quarter. I'll talk more about the average revenue per car decline in a moment. First, finished vehicle shipments declined 3% as winter weather impacted shipments and we had a couple of plants with unscheduled shutdowns. While automotive production was strong in the quarter, the severe winter weather contributed to year-over-year sales declines in January and February. Sales rebounded strongly in March, up 5.6% thanks to improved weather and dealer incentives. We expect that our finished vehicle shipments to rebound as the rail network recovers from the challenging weather. From the parts side volume increased 9% with strong production and over-the-road conversions driving gains. The decrease I mentioned earlier in average revenue per car reflects a change in the way we handle per diem revenue on Intermodal containers used by our customers for auto parts. As a result in 2014 the per diem revenue is included in other revenues instead of automotive commodity revenue. Chemicals volume was flat for the quarter with revenue up 2% on a 3% increase on average revenue per car. Industrial chemicals volume was up 7%, driven by strength in end user market such as shale related drilling, paper products and the icing materials. Fertilizer shipments were up 7% for the quarter on strong export potash demands. Crude oil volume declined 18% compared to the first quarter of last year with price spreads negatively impacting volume. Partially offsetting the decline was an increase in our prior shipments to the Gulf Coast. Turning now to coal, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume. The average revenue per car declined 4% driven by mix and lower fuel prices. Southern Powder River basin tonnage was up 2% as demand from the cold winter and higher natural gas prices offset our previously reported contract loss. Colorado, Utah coal tonnage was up 13%, and benefitting from the increased domestic demand as well as gains in West Coast exports. We continue to see strength from other coal producing regions where tonnage was up 25% for the quarter. Now in industrial products business, a 9% increase in volume and a 1% improves in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 10%. Non-metallic minerals volume was up 18% for the quarter. We continue to see strong demand for frac sand and shale related drilling which was up 22% over last year. Aggregate and cement demand were strong particularly in Texas and California, driving construction shipments up 10% for the first quarter. And our government and waste shipments were up 23%, driven by a waste customer adding short haul shipments in January and February. Additionally the winter weather increased demand for salt, while shipments were up 28% compared to the first quarter last year. Intermodal revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by 3% volume gain and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal volume was up 8% in the quarter, driven by strength from our traditional IMC customers, new motor carrier customers and demand for new premium service offerings. Headwinds from the severe winter weather were offset by business development and highway conversions. Our international Intermodal volumes declined 1% against the strong comparison from the first quarter of 2013. The winter weather impacted consumer demand and imports to the West Coast ports were down nearly 3% for the first two months of the year. Now take a look at how we see out business shaping up for the rest of 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to strengthen modestly this year. Last year's strong crops should provide opportunity for ag products in the second quarter with anticipated strength in both domestic and export grain markets. 2014 crop yields will be dependent on the weather. In food and refrigerator, we expect growth in import beer, but the draught in California could create a headwind for tomato paste and canned goods. Automotive market fundamentals remain strong with demands for new vehicles, easy access to financing, low interest rates and low fuel prices, all expected to drive increased sales. We should see finished vehicle volume rebound in the second quarter as continue to recover from the winter weather. Most of our chemicals markets should remain solid throughout 2014. Crude by rail will continue to be impacted by spreads, a growing gulf crude supply and increased pipeline capacity. Lower inventories will continue to be a driver for our coal business in the second quarter. Weather conditions in summer will influence how things shape up for the full year. Industrial products should continue to benefit from shale related activity with increased drilling, supporting growth in frac sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts were off to a slow start in 2014, but they are still projected to exceed 1 million units which we anticipate will drive demand for lumber shipments and we think the strength in construction products will continue. Highway conversions and new product offerings should continue to drive growth in domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal should benefit from a continued improving economy and strengthening housing market. For the full year our strong value preposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across our broad portfolio business. Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in 2014, driven by continued volume growth and corporation's gains. With that I'll turn in over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance which is the foundation of our operations. The first quarter of 2014 reportable injury rate improved 3% versus 2013. Progress achieved through our comprehensive safety strategy, the number of severe injuries during the quarter declined to a record low reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents, our team's commitment to the Courage to Care and the maturation of our total safety culture. Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate finished up 7% versus the quarterly record set in 2013. However the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold decreased to a record lows in each of the first three months of this year. Looking forward we expect continued improvement from investments that harden our infrastructure, expand advanced defect detection technology and enhance our ability to find and address risks. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improvement slightly versus 2013. Driver behaviour continues to be a critical element. To make continued progress we're focussed on improving or closing high risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. Severe winter weather conditions were a headwind to our safety performance during the quarter, most notably where our employees faced the brunt of below zero temperatures and record snowfall. Even so the team did a tremendous job addressing the risks. In addition to impacting safety, the most severe winter weather we've faced in quite a few years materially impacted our first quarter network performance. The impact was evident in the upper Midwest and at interchange points with other carriers, particularly in Chicago. Extremely cold temperatures and significant snowfall disrupted operations by limiting train size, curtailing switching activity, reducing the mobility to mobilize crews to crew load, change locations, elongating equipment cycles and reducing fuel efficiency. Our dedicated employees did a great job battling difficult conditions while maintaining open channels of communication with customers and our interchange partners as we managed through the challenge. We responded by leveraging the unique value of Union Pacific. We adjusted transportation plans to use alternative switching yards and gateways. We realigned resources to where they were needed most and employed the use of our surge capacity. This included increasing our active locomotive fleet by about 600 units since last fall and increasing our active TE&Y workforce by roughly 550 since January. While we mitigated a fair amount of winter\u2019s impact, our service performance fell short of our expectations and we are working hard to achieve a rapid and full recovery. And while that recovery is now underway, most of our first quarter operating performance metrics reflect the winter's impact. Velocity declined 7% as adverse conditions generated an 80% increase in the number of days with major service interruptions. These interruptions temporarily reduced operating capacity during the quarter, particularly in the northern region. The interruptions in subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our service delivery index, a measure which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a brighter note we were able to maintain local service within a decent range, registering a 93.1% industry spot and pool. This metric which measures the delivering or pulling of a car to or from a customer also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year. In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our ability to recover after incidents, reducing their impact on the network. For 2014, we plan to invest around $3.9 billion which is up about $300 million from our 2013 spend. We're purchasing 200 locomotives this year compared to a 100 last year, impart due to future volume growth assumptions as well as our tier 4 emission strategy. We continue to invest in capacity across our network, including new capacity in the upper Midwest and in the South, that support expected growth. And speaking of unit volume growth, for the first time in several years we saw solid and relatively balanced regional volume growth. While severe weather impacted our ability to fully leverage that volume, we were still able to realize meaningful productivity gains. For example the increase in regional TE&Y employees was less than our unit growth, despite the surge of crews we deployed in the North. Freight cart dwell was up 12% for the quarter, driven by a 36% weather related increase in the Northern region. On a more positive note, we held locomotive productivity flat in the face of the headwinds. Our longer term trend of improving locomotive reliability coupled with effective utilization plans should register continued gains going forward. Overall, we generated reasonable productivity improvement as our men and women applied their expertise to improve safety, service and efficiency using the UP way. Our primary focus was serving our customers and keeping our employees safe during difficult operating conditions. The net result was a 2 percentage point improvement in operating ratio, something our team is very proud of achieving in a very difficult quarter. In summary, our full year operating outlook for 2014 remains positive. We are confident we are on a path for restoring operations back to normal. We're focussed on reducing variability in the network to drive service improvements and we've made progress during the past few weeks. We will continue to work closely with our interchange partners as our recovery and that of the entire rail industry is conditioned upon interchanged fluidity. And as performance improves and as demand dictates, we'll adjust our resource levels accordingly, including moving locomotives back into storage. We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident free environment as network performance improves and we utilize resources more efficiently, our ability to leverage unit growth that generates solid productivity will improve and we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity and high volume quarters while also supporting our safety, service and productivity initiatives. As a result we'll provide customers with a value preposition that supports growth with high levels of service. All combined it translates into increased returns for our shareholders. With that I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Knight : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with the recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all time record of more than $5.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expense totalled nearly $3.8 billion, increasing 3% over last year. Expenses include about $35 million or roughly $0.05 per share of cost associated with the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Operating income grew 14% to more than $1.8 billion, hitting a best ever mark for the first quarter. Below the line other income totalled $38 million, down 5% from 2013. Interest expense of $ 133 million was up 4% compared to the previous year primarily driven by new debt issuances at the beginning to 2014. Income tax expense increased to $671 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 14% versus 2013. While the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best ever first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, up 17% versus 2013. Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 6% to our first quarter record of just under $5.3 billion, driven primarily by 5% volume growth. Lower fuel prices and business mix each drove about a half point decline in our average revenue per car. Both in our grain and frac sands volumes were positive mix drivers, but were more than offset by negative mix in automotive and coal. Eric just pointed out the increases in lower ARC auto parts versus the decrease in finished vehicle volumes which accounts for the negative mix in automotive. As per coal, we did see the benefit of higher ARC volumes including our prior year re-price legacy business, however this was more than offset by increases in lower ARC, shorter haul movements. Increased Intermodal and waste shipments also contributed to the negative mix. Core pricing gains totalled slightly over 2%, continuing our pricing strategy of outpacing inflation. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. As you recall 2014 is a legacy light year. So we will not see the point and a half of legacy benefits which we saw in 2013. We're also seeing the impact of lower inflation on that portion of our business that is tied to inflation escalators primarily All-LF. The type table at the bottom of the slide takes a closer look at the quarterly All-LF escalator. As you can see it rebounded only slightly from negative territory in the fourth quarter last year. While pricing is never easy, we continue to see solid core pricing gains above inflation on the business that we can touch in the marketplace today. Keep in mind also that the positive mix impact of new business or business returning to Union Pacific franchise is reflected in our margin gains but is not added to our core price calculation. We continue to be as focused as ever on pricing to market at rates that earn a fair and re-investible return. Moving on to the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which increased 3% compared to 2013. Higher volumes, inflation and weather were the primary drivers, offset by productivity realized by leveraging the volume growth. Total TE&Y increased slightly, but not at the same rate as our volume growth. However this increase was more than offset by a decrease in employees associated with capital projects for the quarter when compared to 2013. For the remainder of the year we would expect to see compensation and benefits expense to grow, but this will be largely dependent on how volume plays out. In addition we still expect to see labour inflation come in under 2% for the full year. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totalled $921 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher GTMs associated with increased volumes. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis with the weather having come negative impact. Total fuel expense was tempered by a 3% year-over-year decline in average diesel fuel prices. Moving on to the other expense categories, purchase service and materials expense increased 9% to $607 million, due to volume related subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crude transportation and lodging costs. Depreciation expense was $464 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our prior guidance. Looking ahead, we now expect depreciation to be up 7% to 8% this year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rent expense totalled $312 million, which was flat when compared to 2013. Higher freight car rental expenses was offset by lower container lease costs. Other expenses came in at $226 million, down $11 million versus last year. Higher utility expense was more than offset by a year-over-year improvement in our freight and equipment damage costs as well as lower environmental and personal injury expenses. For 2014, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items. Turning to our operating ratio performance. Pricing the business at re-investible levels and moving it safely and efficiently continues to drive results. We achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 67.1% improving two points when compared to 2013. Longer term, we remain committed to achieving an operating ratio below 65% before 2017. We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation and improving overall financial returns. Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations increased to almost $1.8 billion. You'll recall that we expect the headwind of about $400 million this year due to tax payments associated with prior years' bonus depreciation. These payments will be reflected in subsequent quarters. We invested about $900 million this quarter in cash capital investments and also returned $363 million in dividend payment to our shareholders. Also, in keeping our commitment to achieve a dividend pay-out range of 30% to 35%, we increased our declared dividend per share by 32% on a year-over-year basis. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we issued $1 billion of new debt in January bringing our adjusted debt balance to $13.3 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 38.4% up from 37.6% at yearend '13. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted debt to cap ratio of approximately 40% and a debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 by yearend. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute our cash allocation strategy. Our record profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and grow shareholder returns. In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. As you may recall, our new repurchased authorization of up to 60 million shares over a four-year time period went into effect January 1st of this year. Under this new authority, we bought back 3.8 million shares totalling $683 million in the first quarter. This brings accumulative share repurchases since 2007 to $110 million shares. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. It represents roughly 45% increase over 2013, clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value. So that's a recap of the first quarter result. As we look to the remainder of the year, its favourable economy and some help from the weather will combine with our commitment on core pricing above inflation and our on-going productivity initiatives to produced continued margin improvement and record financial results. With that, I'll turn it back to Jack. John Koraleski : Okay. Thanks, Rob. As we put this winter behind us, we're off to a good start for the year. As always, there's going to be some challenges ahead. But we also see opportunity. In the weeks ahead, we'll be focused on restoring the fluidity of our network after the winter slowdown. We're absolutely committed to pursuing the excellent service our customers expect and deserve. It's a cornerstone of our on-going success. Our value proposition to our customers depends on it. Strong service goes hand in hand with improvements in network in asset utilization that are so critical to our future. Another potential challenge for the entire industry is the uncertain regulatory environment, which is being played out in Washington D.C., Canada and Mexico. We're watching things closely on all fronts making sure that regulators truly understand the importance of a healthy growing rail industry. We're also watching the weather and the economy very closely. There's still a lot of year ahead of us, so we'll have to see how the summer burn plays out for coal demand and how the 2014 crops will fair everything from planning through harvest. As far as the economy goes, a lot can change between now and the end of the year. But at this point, we're seeing some signs of gradual economic improvement. And we're encouraged by the opportunities it presents. With the power and the potential of the Union Pacific franchise, we'll leverage these opportunities to drive record financial performance and shareholder returns this year and in the years' to come. So with that, let's get started and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : So I wanted to just first ask about the yields, particularly on the auto and coal side. So if I'm understanding this right, as finished vehicles start to grow again as whether it gets better, shall we start thinking about auto yields growing again? And then on the coal side, with yields down 4% year-over-year, they were just so strong in first quarter last year up 16%, was there anything unusual, like any liquidated damages last year that you didn't have this year that's driving that? Because I'm just not sure how to model coal yields going forward. Robert Knight : Yes. Scott, let me talk about the autos first. As Eric mentioned in his comments, there was a process changed and affected some per diem treatment on some containers. It basically accounts for all of the decline in the autos' arc. On top of that then, as he also pointed out, the mid shift of finished vehicles and more auto parts also had an impact on arc. So we don\u2019t give guidance on what the mix is going to look like or what the arc is going to look like by commodity line, and we don't do it by the way as a company. But directionally, yes, if we see growth in finished vehicles outpacing the growth in auto parts, you would expect that trend to move in that direction. We're not giving that specific guidance, but you're thinking about it right. On the coal, our coal arc was down 4%, roughly half of that was driven by mix. I mean your traditional mix. If you might see, that's a great movement of shorter haul coal moves and less shipments of the higher. In some cases, repriced coal business. And the other half was made up of lower fuel prices drove lower average every car on the arc line. And year-over-year, you're exactly right, there was a small, as you recall we pointed out. It was roughly $15 million of liquidity. The damage is last year that did not repeat this year. That at this point, I don't see that our trend is continuing throughout the year. So that had a little bit of an impact on our coal arc line as well. And that piece was about 1.5, if you will, of the 1.5% of the 4% decline. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. That's very helpful. And then I just wanted to take a shot at the long-term margin guidance. So if I look at historically at the first quarter OR and then the full year OR, the full year typically is about three to four points better than the first quarter, and you had weather in 1Q. I mean it feels like we're on a run rate this year around 64% for the OR. And that's just so much -- so different than the sub-65 in 2017. So I'm not sure that if the long-term guidance is just really still or is there something that you're telling us that we need to be thinking about or worried about the next three quarters that's going to dramatically change the trajectory margins. John Koraleski : Hey, Scott, our guidance is below 65 before 2017, not in 2017. Rob, why don't you fill in the blanks on that? Robert Knight : Yes. Scott, I mean we hope you're right. I mean there's a lot of things that have to play out. I mean we certainly hope for the economy cooperates fuel prices as you've heard us speak many times. It can have an impact directly on the margins and the operating ratio. So as we've said all along on this financial improvement journey over the last decade, we're not looking at the sub-65% as an endpoint and we're not going to slowdown. We're going to get there safely and efficiently as we can. And if all the stars line, the economy cooperates and we move in direction that we hope everything happens, we get there as soon as we can. But our best look at this point in time is that it looks to us like it's sometime before 2017. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the volume pace, as you came out of the first quarter, things obviously ramping up. It seems like there was probably some pent up demand here that's carried into the second quarter. How do we think about sort of how long that last and maybe the pace of activity here? And how much is sort of still yet to be moved and wants to be moved and kind of when can the catch up do you think? John Koraleski : Yes. I think you're exactly right, Chris. I think as we move towards the end of the quarter, we were catching up from some of the issues in the early quarter. But our volume outlook is still fairly decent for the year. So Eric, you want to \u2026 Eric Butler : Yes. Chris, as Jack said, clearly, there were some catch up, particularly when you think about the difficulties that the winter had on the automotive business. And then deep in coal utilities, there was a strong coal burn, and so there was some catch up there. You can also think about our grain business and the grain harvest. There's a natural processing in the first quarter shipping the record corn harvest that we had in the fourth quarter. But like Jack said, I'm pretty optimistic about a slowly-strengthening economy for the balance of the year. Slowly strengthening economy across our book of business will have positive impacts. Plus, we continue to have a strong valued proposition. And so we're optimistic for the balance of the year. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup: That's great. That's very helpful. And on the coal side, when you think about the inventories of the utilities that you're serving relative to the length of haul differences that I think showed up here in the first quarter, how should we think about that? Is there any imbalance there we might suggest you have stronger volumes continuing to the shorter length of haul utilities? Any sort of color you could give there would be helpful. Eric Butler : Yes, I would say this. Those kind of balance in and out. Inventories are quite low. As you probably know, there are about 21 days below what would be considered normal. So they're quite low. But there's no kind of imbalance between short and long haul that would have a mix change for the future. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup: Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : Great. Good morning. Great job working through the weather. Just a follow up on the short haul freight that you've gained, it seems like a lot impacting the mix. Can you talk if there's any long-term impact on margins? And really, is this long-term business or is this because some competitors are having infrastructure issues as they fix that, some of that reverts back to a different network or is this more permanent business in nature? John Koraleski : Yes. It really kind of depends on the individual markets, Ken. For instance, the short haul move that Eric referenced on the waste product is a customer of ours that just historically last year had moved for nine months, and this year really picked up a volume in the first. So that's kind of an on-going issue for us. Rob, do you want to -- do you have any more with the \u2026 Rob Knight : Yes. Can I just say -- I mean your question is heading right on the reason why you heard me many, many times, say we're not going to get guide this fund on average revenue per car because mix is always a part of our business. And when you look as diverse as our franchise is, as diverse as all of our commodity groups are, mix is rather normal. But as you also are questioning in terms of the margin, just because something has a short haul lower average revenue per car doesn't mean it has a lower margin. So we're not afraid of that at all. We're pricing and moving the business as efficiently as we can, driving our margins which in fact we've done. We did that in the first quarter even with this negative mix impact. So mix will always be a part of our business, but we're focused on improving our margins regardless of the length of haul. John Koraleski : As Rob said, if we can get our re-investability threshold met, we're happy to take the business. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : That's great insight. Thanks. Just a follow up on the locomotive side, and I guess demand side overall. You noted demand kind of creeping in a little bit on a gradual improvement. If we start seeing, I guess, a faster pace of improvement, what's your thoughts on your ability to handle it to take the capacity access locomotives, your infrastructure's ability to handle it? Maybe it's a Lance questions in terms of scalability of the infrastructure and available capacity. John Koraleski : Absolutely. Lance? Lance Fritz : Sure. So Ken, we feel pretty good about fluidly handing the volume that Eric is bringing on for the network. If you think about where we are right now, the first quarter was, what, 179,078 car loads. We've publicly said we think our network can handle 195,000 plus with a very good excellent service product. So we're looking forward to that volume. Of course, it's dependent to some degree on exactly where it shows up. But you know, we've been putting capacity into the network in anticipation of that, and we feel pretty good about handling the volume. John Koraleski : And our first quarter was pretty balanced, so we like that. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : And similarity access to locomotives to handle that? Is that infrastructure still available? John Koraleski : It is. If you think about how many locomotives we have left in surge right now. It's a little over 300. That's bearing in mind that we brought in what was at 600 locomotives since the fall with a large portion those not driven by volume, but instead driven by trying to overcome winter's impact. So we've got surgery resources that will be able to handle it. Lance Fritz : So as we spin up volume and our operating stats improve, we'll actually be seeking some power out of the network and putting it back in storage. John Koraleski : That's right. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, I wanted to ask you about pricing. When we see this inflation metrics start to rise a bit, is it logical to think that the core pricing headline starts to rise as well? Is it as simple as that or is there another element though that you have to keep in mind? Robert Knight : I mean that part of business that is tied to the All-LF and there were timing differences. And as you've heard us comment many times, they're not all the same. Those contracts and those pieces of our business that are tied to the All-LF have different timeframes of when they trigger. So you pick that into consideration. But directionally, if inflation increases and as All-LF in fact reflects that, that part of business that is tied to All-LF will increase. Yes. William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Right. And then as we look \u2026 next year is a legacy. It's got more legacy in it, right? So as we look to next year, this should have a pretty good directional trend. Robert Knight : Yes, next year, Bill, as you've heard us say several times, we've got roughly $300 million of revenue which tends to be sort of frontend a business that we will compete for in the marketplace. But it's about $300 million of legacy revenue next year. William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Right. And then on inflation, I think in the past you've talked about seeking to offset it with productivity. But if it's going to run this low, is there a chance that our productivity actually causes our -- so not the cost-related to the volume growth, but rather just a fix cost based in the productivity. Can that actually cost the number to go down? Robert Knight : Lance could comment on this as well. But I would say, potentially. Again, as what you're referring to, Bill, as you know is we set the price the business to market, achieve a successful above inflation sort of pricing environment. And then in addition to that, offset, and we challenge ourselves to offset all. But if we hit 50% of offsetting inflation through productivity, that's a great model. And to your point, we're in a lower inflation area environment and a positive volume environment that gives us more options to do as well as we can on that. John Koraleski : That's perfect. Rob is absolutely right. Mirroring what Rob says about our drive to an improved OR, there's -- we don't set a limit as just offset inflation. We look for efficiency and productivity everyday through the UP way. William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley : That's great. Thank you so much for your time. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go over with your question. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Good morning, guys. It's been well publicized that your competitors had some major, major service issues, and it seems like you guys probably got some freight from them. How much do that really stress the system in the first quarter when you saw on top of the weather, and everything else? John Koraleski : Jason, if you look at our issues in the first quarter, it was 99% winter. The additional volume and whatever we've taken on either of our own bringing on to the network or anything that might have been diverted on a temporary or permanent basis basically just would have been handled easily by our resources or infrastructure of the investments we've made in the past. So it did not -- the additional business did not stress our network. It was just really the impact of winter weather and the impact that it had not only on Union Pacific but broad-based throughout the industry on our interchange partners. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay. And Jack, this is a broader question. I asked this on another call the other day. We've had issues with Chicago as an interchange in the real network, the entire topic been an analyst. I mean obviously it was great exacerbated this quarter with winter weather. And I know there's been projects around, like they create a project to try to improve that. What's really just holding the rail in street back from all giving together and really just trying to fix this interchange once and for all? Because it seems like this is something that would benefit sixth or the seventh class once going forward. John Koraleski : My perspective on that, Jason, is Create still is a blueprint for how we can significantly improve the throughput in the Chicago area. But each railroad has its own issues that's stealing with as well. And so in our world, we're making investments. We're planning. We're working together having the centralized operating controlled group in Chicago help to mitigate some of the winter weather. But there's lessons learned here. And I'm sure that as we come out of this first quarter experience, we'll learn from that, the industry will learn from that. We spend a lot of time working with our interchange partners on throughput and volumes, and things like that, how can we handle things more fluidly, our ability to divert to different gateways depending on the individual interchange partner, those kinds of things. So I think there'll be lessons learned from this. But I still fundamentally think the investment and the strategy identified and Create holds a lot of potential for us. Lance, what do you think? Lance Fritz : Yes. Absolutely, Jack. And there's something that the participants in Create have been public about, and that is since the start of Create, we've taken a half a day out of the time it takes for a car to transfer through Chicago side to side, end to end, which is real progress. It's down by about a third. And this year's winter was epic. And in the absence of Create and the Chicago Planning Group and the coordination that the interchange railroads undertook, it would have been a much worse outcome. Clearly, lessons learned, but it was effective. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: And Lance, what do you think that number can come to? You said it's down by a third. I mean will it keep down by \u2026 Lance Fritz : No. So think about it like this. We've got 17 capital projects already in place, complete. There are 20 are in designer underway, and so each one of those is going to help. So there's still fair amount of upside in terms of reducing the time it takes cars contributors. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay. Jim, I really appreciate the time as always. John Koraleski : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning gentlemen. John Koraleski : Good morning, John. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to focus on the real cost escalator chart that was in Rob's, actually in the presentation. And if you look back at the trailing four quarters, that's pretty tampered inflation. And I would have thought with the labor cost, the escalation built in your contracts that certainly overtime you would've seen more than an average of less than one, which I think it probably works out to be there. Anything that's going on there that were missing? And would you expect that to continue over the next four quarters? Robert Knight : Yes, John. I think you're going to see it continue to be low for the next four quarters. And if you recall that our labor inflation, which as you know the way the All-LF works is a market basket of inputs from the industry. But the labor inflation for us, we think it's going to be less than 2% this year. So that is a big piece of what's in there. And so it is driving and has been for quite some time now the reduction in that All-LF number. So it lines up, and overtime it does what it's intended to do. From quarter to quarter, there might be some timing issues. But it's done its job over multiple quarter and multiyear period. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-on on the timing of the restoration of complete fluidity in and around Chicago in the northern -- into the network. One of the executives giving testimony at the STB last week suggested that Chicago should be back in normal completely within four to six weeks. Is that in keeping with kind of your expectations? And will there be any meaningful impact on the EPS line during that restoration period? John Koraleski : Hey, Lance, why don't you handle the outlook? Lance Fritz : Yes. Okay, John. So we are very encouraged by what we see happening on our network right now. We're confident that sometime in the second quarter we will be back to normal. We're working to make that as soon as possible. And in terms of Chicago interchange, that's a difficult question for me to answer because it's dependent on how quickly the networks of interchange railroads come up to speed. What we see right now is real solid improvement as we've exited winter. John Koraleski : Yes. So we're hoping it won't be a material. You won't see a lot of it in the second quarter from a cost perspective. But it really depends on how it plays itself out. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. John Koraleski : Good morning. Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Rob, with regards to the incremental margins, as I'm taking a step back and kind of listening to what I heard on the call, it's fairly a mix work against you guys. There's a lot of incremental cause associated with winter weather which meant the network wasn't -- probably wasn't running as full as it could in constrained train lengths. Should I think about the Q1 64% incremental margin as being a low for the year and expanding from there? Robert Knight : Rob, as you know, we don't give that level of guidance. But as you heard me say many times, for us to get from where we are today to our sub-65, and we're not going to slow down to get there in time. We get there as efficiently as we can. As soon as we're going to get 50% kind of number on incremental margins from here to there, there can be lumpiness from quarter to quarter depending on volumes of weather and other issue, fuel prices and other issues. So, you know, we're going to keep doing as well as we can. But I've shied away from getting specific quarterly guidance on that incremental margin number other than to get to our sub-65, we've got to continue to make good progress. Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. That's right. But we should think about the network running more fluidly, and that should obviously help overall operational performance, I would imagine. Robert Knight : That would be a plus. Absolutely. And then we'll see what volume -- our volume actually plays out. Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes. It's fair. I'm not sure if this question should be directed towards Lance or towards Eric. I noticed in the network productivity section, one of the slides. You guys were calling out about 4% volume growth in the north. And as recently as a couple of quarters that it had been down on a year-over-year basis, clearly, your primary competitor in the west has been having a lot of challenges in that region. It looks like the TE&Y headcount, it increased about 6% year-over-year. Is this 6% growth with regard to expectations for future volume growth are just handling current traffic? And on a side note of that, can you give us a sense if you guys are seeing incremental competitive wins in the north, what type of traffic that's coming on, if it's coming on on the manifest network or unit train network? Eric Butler : Yes, I think what you saw in the TE&Y buildup of 6%, Rob, was basically the impact of winter where we flooded the northern region with extra labor to help us work our way through the winter process. And it's not necessarily a reflection of what's happening in the north on an ongoing basis. Lance, you want to -- is that okay? Lance Fritz : Yes, that's perfect. Yes, yes. Eric Butler : And then the other thing is when you think about our northern region, think about that's where the grain is, that's where frac sand is and our model is sitting there and also our coal business. And so, those were all some fairly decent volume gains just intrinsic in the business itself. Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Appreciate the color. It sounds like more unit train there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up with a question on coal and specifically the growth in Colorado, Utah coal versus Southern Powder River Basin. So you mentioned 13% tonnage growth in Colorado and 2% in SPRB. Was that a function of whether or easy comps? How do we think about sort of the relative tonnage growth with the respect of these two origins for the balance of the year? John Koraleski : Okay, Eric? Eric Butler : Yes, tonnage. When you think about Colorado-Utah coal, there was some easy comps year over year. We do continue to expect in the outlook to see a Colorado-Utah coal being a good source for export coal as the export coal opportunity strengthen in the future. But I think if you think about it going forward, Southern Powder River Basin growth will probably outpace Colorado-Utah growth going forward in terms of upside opportunity. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And is it fair to say that the SPRB has a longer length of haul? Eric Butler : That depends on the origin and destination pair. But that's probably not an unreasonable expectation. But it depends on the origin of destination pair. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it. Okay. And then just -- I have a couple of questions on the frac sand business. You mentioned the volumes were up over 20% in the quarter. So I was wondering if you talk a little bit about the sustainability of this pace of growth over the next couple of years as new minds continue to come online in Wisconsin. And then could you give us some sense of how much of the frac business you are originating and terminating on your own minds? And maybe what shales you're delivering the most active? Eric Butler : Yes. We're very excited about our frac sand franchise. We think we have the premier origination franchise and we think a significant portion of the new mines that are coming online in the Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois region actually are coming on. Our franchise, at least access our franchise. So we're pretty optimistic about the longevity and the outlook from that standpoint. At the end of the day, it's really going to be drilling that really drives the consumption of frac sand and the drilling trends in terms of longer mines, longer drilling, deeper drilling, deeper horizontal more fracing all are pointing to significant continued growth in frac sand consumption, on those the really interesting friends in Texas in particular for Permian basin and Eagle Ford basin, I think in January I don\u2019t know, the February March numbers have come up but in January Texas had an all-time record of production of oil in terms of record just going back to the early 80s. So as long as those drilling trends continue you'll see the frac sand demand continue and we have a premier frac sand franchise. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : And I would imagine that has a pretty good length of haul from Wisconsin to Texas. Is that correct? Eric Butler : Turbos [ph] is north, south, it\u2019s not as long as some east west moves but it is a pretty good part of our franchise. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital : Rob, I wanted to come back to the discussion on pricing. Because I feel like there's a lot of maybe misunderstanding around the core pricing gains. Obviously you had higher levels of gains last year, but actually we're seeing better margin expansion this quarter. Can you just expand on your comment about how the new and incremental business is not necessarily captured in your metrics? Robert Knight : Yeah, I mean you have heard me say this many times but the way we calculate price at Union Pacific is how much price do we yield in a particular time period against our entire book of business. I am very proud of the way we calculate it because it\u2019s the most conservative way of looking at it. What I pointed is that, so what that means that if we bring on a new piece of business or business that we haven't had for over a year let\u2019s say, that business might come on at great margins, of course we\u2019re very focused on bringing on at the right margins at the market level pricing. But it wouldn\u2019t show up in the new price, I mean it wouldn\u2019t show up in the year-over-year calculation of price. So you\u2019re exactly right, when we point out that our pricing was up 2% and all the headwinds we faced, low legacy number light and All-LF impact, the reason that we were able to expand our margins is we were able to leverage the business, leverage the new volumes that came on and as new business came on, we are confident we are pricing it right but it doesn\u2019t show up in the pricing number, but it shows up in our margins. Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital : And that's what we should really be focused on, to see how you are delivering on the pricing front, right? Robert Knight : I mean clearly pricing is a tool along with productivity and other things that we do, but at the end of the day margin expansion is clearly the ultimate driver, the ultimate answer. Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hopefully, I can just get one follow-up in here for Lance. Lance, I think you did state that the network is designed for 190,000, 195,000 units, I believe. That's about 5% from where you've been running the last few weeks. Does that signal that we need a lot more CapEx going forward? Or are there any structural constraints in the network that make it tough to get to 200,000? Lance Fritz : No, Brandon, what we typically say is 195, 200,000, several days we could handle fluidly and we say that because in 2006 we peaked at a number about like that very different service product at that time and since then we improved processes, we\u2019ve invested capital, we have more surge capacity and that's what gives us the confidence level. From the point of view of handling the volume that Eric\u2019s team is bringing on right now and for the rest of the year, absent some acute areas where maybe we've got a very specific capacity constraint we feel very good about being able to satisfy that with a high service product. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group : There's a lot of regulatory balls in the air, the STB particularly, relative to just a few months ago. And you also mentioned some things developing in Canada and Mexico earlier in your comments. I was just hoping if you look at these all at once, could you help frame what, in your mind, is the greatest long-term concern for you? And perhaps additionally what's more immediate that you're looking at today that could impact you fairly soon? John Koraleski : That\u2019s a fairly broad question and so we treat each of those as a very serious issue and we look at them very carefully and closely. So we\u2019re watching what's happening with Needling [ph] proposals the service hearings, the Canadian directed agricultural equipments, the Mexico reform. So in each of those cases we have teams of people looking at working very hard to ensure as I said in my opening remarks that everyone understands the importance of having a viable growing and healthy rail system that\u2019s paid for by private investment and not tax share dollars. So while we consider each one of those to be a very serious and concerning development it also gives us the opportunity to position all of the great things that not only Union Pacific but the entire rail industry has done by the constant reinvestment and investment of capital dollars to build the transportation infrastructure in this country and actually throughout North America that there is today. So we take them all one by one, if you look at the new discussion around revenue adequacy it\u2019s going to be an opportunity for us to point out the benefits of what\u2019s happened so far, the investment that\u2019s been made, the importance of having decisions that were going to change things to recognize replacement costs, those kinds of things. The service hearings, I think well I think could position us well to tell the story of how even though it was a difficult quarter for the industry, the capital investment made it a lot better than it probably would've been if it had happened five or 10 years ago. In Mexico, we've been working very hard to make sure the government understands the importance in the developments and the volumes that have improved since we took on our concession in partnership with the FXE and that if they look at the throughput and the development of transportation within the country it has certainly helped to grow the Mexico economy. If you look at all the investment from the automotive industry and things like that. So we look at these as every one of them, well, it's a serious issue if it were to go it right, give us a great opportunity to talk about all the good things that have happened. And so we\u2019re not afraid of them, we\u2019re willing to step up to the plate and participate each and every one of them to make sure our story gets told. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : I guess my first question here is for Lance. With all the difficulty you had in the winter weather you still managed to keep your headcount under good control here and didn't really need to resource up significantly to add any redundancy. So, that's quite impressive. But I'm just wondering is that reflective of what could've been a lower headcount if you didn't have the weather? How should we look at your headcount as you go through the year and the year this year? Lance Fritz : So Walter, we think about headcount, resourcing, for the volume that shows up where it shows up, so that we can maintain an excellent service product. I won\u2019t look backwards and guess that what it would've been if winter hadn\u2019t happened. Going forward the right way to think about our headcount is exactly as Rob states with productivity we should be able to keep headcount growth lower than volume growth and I feel pretty confident we are going to be able to do that. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : So there is no -- nothing that distorted that in the first quarter that you're going to significantly drop headcount now in the second quarter or anything like that? Lance Fritz : That\u2019s correct. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Second question now. As you alluded to in a number of different ways in your ag business, lot of volatility. You mentioned weather, you mentioned related to that the significant drought from last year, the unpredictability of that. If we look at the current trends in the first quarter carloads, it seems to be off to a very good start, not only on a comp basis, as an easy comp basis, but also on an absolute basis. I'm just curious if, as we model this out in future years, given how important the ag business is, when we look back at historical average levels, be it on carload or overall crop size, is there any reason why your carload volumes would be any different from an average run rate level historically, or is that how we should look at it? Might we need to revert our 2015 ag estimates downwards to reflect perhaps a very healthy 2014 haul? Eric Butler : Walter, as you recall last year or 2012 going into 2013, there was the drought which significantly impacted our volumes last year, the same time first quarter. So if you look at year-over-year the fact that there was a record corn harvest and harvest started in October and the volumes are moving through the first quarter of this year, clearly is the primary driver behind the volumes that we are seeing. There were some as we said stress in the grain network on our competitors, so there was some small portion of incremental volumes we had assisting the market due to that, those challenges that they had. But again that surrounding the bigger issue was the record corn harvest was a pretty good bean harvest, pretty good wheat harvest and in terms of going forward in the future, again the weather will determine the yields, will determine the production and that will determine the volumes that move during harvest season. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : If I could sneak one last one in here on the regulatory standpoint. I heard all your commentary. Perhaps you could give us if, to the extent you know it, the next few catalysts for any potential changes or regulatory -- in other words, are we going to stay within the confines of the STB and their actions? Or could there be any other occurrences that might impact the STBs, any changes the STB might make on the regulatory front? John Koraleski : At this point in time as we look at it, the regulatory model is based on railroads being allowed to earn their rate of return and be revenue adequate. And we don't see a lot on the legislative front, there is the railroad antitrust bill that has been introduced but has seen no action and so we haven't really seen a lot on the regulatory front, other than what's happening in the STB and actually as we look at the STB hearings, they are taking a very measured and thoughtful approach to it. So we are in good shape. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.: We've been hearing a lot lately about a tightening truckload environment. And you would imagine this should bode well for intermodal pricing as we progress throughout the year. Do think you will be in a position to get better intermodal pricing in 2014 versus what you've seen the past few years? Eric Butler : As we said we continue to price the market and we are continuedly focused on taking advantage of strong demand. As you mentioned the CSA is having an impact on trucking capacity, had an impact in the winter because of the safety concerns that probably were, was some trucking capacity that self selected themselves out of taking trips on the most difficult portion of the winter weather, because of the concern of the risk with CSA. But we continue to think that the intermodal opportunity is strong, trucking capacity is tightening and we continue to think that that's a good outlook for our book of business. Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Maybe a follow-up to that. How much flexibility do you have to move pricing in intermodal? Have you already established your rates for this year or do you have the ability to raise rates throughout 2014 if the market and demand continues to move higher? Eric Butler : As we have talked in the past, a portion of business is in different segments, some in long-term contracts, some in one year contracts that rotate or come up throughout the year, some in instruments that you can change on a relatively frequent basis. Our intermodal business has the same kind of profile and as we have opportunities based on demand and market prices we will them. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar: My question is for Eric. Eric, your comments remain quite positive on the 2014 economy. And I want to ask you about chemicals in particular, given the sea change in US natural gas economics from fracking. Would you share any new developments or your expectations for what industries within chemicals might lead rail volume growth? And if you think this will come on next year or further into the future? Eric Butler : I think we have said several times in the past that with the relatively low natural gas prices, futures is still I think around 450 or something like that. You\u2019re seeing a lot of plastics development coming on a number of different plants that have been announced for expansion, I think we said in the past and in previous earnings releases that most of those will come on in 2016, 2017 that we continue to see strong upside opportunity from that. Our fertilizer business we continue to see a strong upside opportunity in our fertilizer business. So fertilizers, plastics, industrial chems, we think are long-term positive outlooks. Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar: And I guess just a quick follow-up on the Mexico discussion. Given this business is handed off to your US assets rather than your own operations in Mexico, and I recall the Ferromex ownership stake. Can you comment on how you believe your franchise would actually be effective if the bill proposed became law? Is this just a bad precedent for other jurisdictions or would this in itself have material impact to UP? John Koraleski : I think overall if you look at our franchise, the Union Pacific franchise, the business is moving into and out of Mexico, it's not going to really change materially, our ability to deliver goods about to the border and also to have taken from the border and deliver them throughout the US. Robert Knight : You heard us say this before but our interest in this is we don't want to see something that erodes commerce in Mexico and we think one of the unintended consequences of potential bill is that that it would create less commerce in Mexico. But as you know the only railroad that crosses 6 border crossings in and out of Mexico, so we just like to see commerce continue to grow and volumes continue to one across the border both ways and we are ready to handle it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein Research. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research : Just two quick questions maybe on the growth outlook. Eric, the intermodal weeklies are looking pretty strong right now. How much of that is the Santa Teresa opening versus maybe some just straight organic conversion versus share take? Eric Butler : So we did open our Santa Teresa facility April 1 of this year and we think that, that will be a strong lever for us for that market, that market. I think we talked publicly that, that new ramp has about 250,000 less capacity, if you think about our domestic intermodal business is 1.6 million units, so we are seeing a strong growth with our products and services across-the-board, certainly new product offerings from Santa Teresa will add to that. But we are seeing strong growth across the board. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research : Should we think that that Santa Teresa opening of that terminal is going to continue this growth through the year and it laps? Or is this more -- I guess I'm trying to figure out of the current strength is more of a temporary thing that should ebb as the weather sort of eases up and other rail service improves or if we should be expecting these higher upper single-digit growth in intermodal going forward? Eric Butler : So the current strength is, the strength that we are seeing across our book of business, when ramp opens up there is a gradual ramp up and there is going to be a gradual ramp up in Santa Teresa. The current strength in our intermodal business is depending on slowly growing economy and our value proposition and that\u2019s an across the board opportunity for our book of business rate. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research : Maybe just as a separate question. Are you guys seeing any development of terminals for handling heavy crude-by-rail, either in the western, specifically California refineries or down in Texas on your network? Eric Butler : As we have spoken before, there are number of different terminals that are under development both on the West Coast and to the extent also in the Gulf Coast. We\u2019re working actively and part of our strategy is to strengthen franchise we cannot direct when and where crude oil will flow, that\u2019s determined by strength that our franchise wants, to, we will ensure we have a franchise that landed when and where at once they flow. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research : Would you think that western -- those western refineries might have perhaps a little bit of a cost advantage via rail relative to the Gulf? Eric Butler : I am not really sure what you are asking, when you say cost advantage you mean lower rail costs? David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research : Yeah, lower, just to move from western Canada down to the Western \u2013 Eric Butler : It will be market based and we will price to take advantage of the value of our franchise whether it\u2019s going to the west coast or to the Gulf Coast. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird: I think a question for Lance. If I look at cars online, cars online are call it 10% to 12% above trough levels of last year. As we think about volume growth accelerating and the cross current of the network normalizing into the third quarter, how should we think about the asset requirements of the network going forward? Can we continue to think about cars online falling as they were through all of last year? Or should we think about those 2013 levels as the trough and now that we do see volume growth accelerate that that growth number should lag, but we won't quite pierce and fall below the best levels realized last year? Can you provide some perspective there? Robert Knight : Sure, Ben, as I look at car inventory on our railroad right now the large majority of the growth year-over-year is about winter impact and I am expecting that portion of inventory to ultimately bleed off as we\u2019re able to interchange it off to other carriers or ultimately get it to a customer on our own railroad. There is some amount of that growth that\u2019s driven by unit volume growth and what I really look at and care about is car productivity as opposed to the absolute inventory number. The absolute inventory number is important for me as an overall indicator but what we really try to drive is good utilization of the cars that are on us. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners. Don Broughton \u2013 Avondale Partners : Real quick, you talked about wage inflation. Looking at the comp benefit line, obviously wage inflation 2%. What are the other puts and takes, performance bonuses we hope you earn, pension tailwinds? What else is going to be pushing and/or pulling that line in 2014? Robert Knight : On that line, a big offset if you will to wage inflation has been the pension expense, pension side of the equation and that\u2019s been the reason why I say that our labor line for the full year is expected to be below 2%. Don Broughton \u2013 Avondale Partners : So the wage inflation actually is higher than that, it's just that the actual line itself will be -- come in at under 2%? Robert Knight :  That\u2019s correct. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research : Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one on the locomotive CapEx you spoke about. With the tier 4 locomotive standards, this is the first time I think we're using exhaust gas recirculation to meet the standards and the experience of the truckers with this was we ended up with more expensive engines that were not as efficient. What are your thoughts on the locomotives post the tier 4 standard and does this change the economics for you in terms of thinking about natural gas as an alternative fuel in the long run for the locomotive fleet? Lance Fritz : Sure, so first thing to note is, we have a couple of tier 4 test units that are on us, wired up so that we can fully understand with the OEM involved, what the economics and what really the overall performance metrics of those units look like. It is not certain what efficiency impact a tier four locomotive is going to have in relation to a tier 3. I know the OEMs are working very hard to make fuel consumption rates roughly equivalent and so there's more to follow there. And in terms of will delta in that make a fundamental difference in the LNG economics? The answer is that\u2019s probably a minor impact, the major impact is utilization infrastructure costs and couple other elements. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Claire Ouzagareen with Macquarie. Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie: My first question relates to pricing. Could you clarify for us how much of your book is specifically tied to AII-LF or another inflation cost measure? And how much is able to take advantage of improving demand fundamentals for example, in intermodal? Robert Knight : I mean roughly a quarter of our business is tied to an escalator, AII-LF being the major driver of the escalations that we use. I would also then add to that, Eric responded earlier to the intermodal question of what capability does it to have to take pricing up throughout the year and we\u2019ve got a mix of long-term contracts, we\u2019ve got a mix of short-term contracts, we\u2019ve got a mix of annual quotes if you will. So we look to take advantage and move and price to market wherever we can. We don't give specific guidance by commodity as to how much we can touch with any particular timeframe but across our entire book of business. We look to price to market where we have the opportunity. Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie: Would you be able to comment to what verticals are offered most opportunity this year in your opinion? Robert Knight : No, we don\u2019t get into that. Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie: And then my second question relates to [indiscernible] rail opportunities specifically tied to the Permian, would you be able to share with us what kind of growth or infrastructure development projects you are looking for there to enable it to take advantage of production growth, and what kind of commitments you are looking for in the supply chain from a pure capital to developing an area? Eric Butler : As we have said previously, the Permian basin has great coverage, pipeline coverage and that's where most of the production growth has taken in the state of Texas. So if you look at our crude by rail volumes from the Permian they actually had decreased significantly, we have said that in the past. And they are really nominal and going forward there may be some spot opportunities for crude by rail in the Permian but the Permian has great pipeline coverage, we don't expect that to be a driver of any crude by rail volumes going into the future. It is a driver of our drilling materials volumes like frac sand and pipe. Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie: So you are not contemplating maybe laying some new rail into California refineries or that's more science fiction than feasible future? Eric Butler : Yeah, so we are, as I mentioned before, looking at the destination franchise, for crude by rail into California. At this point in time, the market is suggesting a lot of that will be sourced from Canada or the Bakken. There are those in the market we believe that Permian will go to California. If that happens we will be prepared for it but I think the market today is suggesting majority of crude by rail in California will come from Canada or the Bakken. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments. John Koraleski : Well, great, thank you everybody for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may now begin. John J. Koraleski: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we're pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved second quarter earnings of $1.43 per share, an increase of 21% compared to the second quarter of 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 8%, and the increases were nearly across-the-board. We saw growth in 5 of our 6 business groups, with particular strength in Agricultural Products, Intermodal and Industrial Product shipments. We were pleased to see strong volume growth, which, combined with solid core pricing, drove more than 2-point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 63.5% for the quarter. On the operating side, Mother Nature did finally release her winter grip, but we experienced numerous washouts, flooding and mudslides, which caused disruptions to our network during the quarter. In this environment, increasing velocity and fluidity has been a challenge, but we continue to be focused on safely improving network efficiency and service for our customers. So with that, let's get started. I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric L. Butler: Thanks, Jack. Good morning. In the second quarter, volume was up 8% compared to 2013 as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in 5 of our 6 business groups. We had strong gains in Agricultural Products, Intermodal and Industrial Products, and we also saw strength in Automotive and Coal. In Chemicals, declines in crude oil volume were mostly offset by gains in other commodities. Core price improved around 2.5%, which was partially offset by mix that produced a 1.5% improvement in average revenue per car. Our volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 10%, which set an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.7 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products led our growth again this quarter. Volume grew 16%, which, combined with the 2% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue growth up 19%. Strong grain demand continued this quarter, with carloads up 43%. Last year, you may remember that we experienced a tight U.S. corn supply and improved world production, which led to lower exports and reductions in domestic demand for livestock feeding. The strength in U.S. supply and lower commodity prices this quarter drove strong demand for export feed grain. Domestic feed grain demand was also strong across most of our franchise. The one soft spot within grain was wheat, where the smaller hard red winter wheat crop led to a slight decline in overall wheat shipments. Grain products volume was up 8%, led by 15% increase in ethanol shipments. We had a best-ever quarter for ethanol shipments, driven by favorable producer margins, higher gasoline demand and lower ethanol inventories, and DDG shipments grew 33%, driven by strong export shipments to Mexico. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3% for the quarter. Import beer volume was up over 20%, partially offset by declines in rice exports and lower produce in frozen food shipments. Automotive revenue was up 2% in the second quarter on a 6% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 4%, driven primarily by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem revenue and also by mix. Finished vehicles shipments were up 5% this quarter. North American Automotive production continue to be strong, up 4% versus the fourth -- the same quarter in 2013. Also, the sales rebound that started in March continue to gain strength as the second quarter progressed. On the Parts side, volume increased 8%, driven again by strong production demand and over-the-road conversions. Chemicals revenue was up 3% for the quarter, with a 4% average revenue per car improvement, partially offset by a 1% volume decline. Industrial Chemicals volume was up 7%, driven by demand in a variety of markets, such as shale-related drilling; inventory replenishment of de-icing materials after a strong winter demand; and increased demand for chemicals used in nylon production. Fertilizer shipments were up 2% for the quarter. Strong export potash demand, coupled with the delayed spring planting season in the U.S., drove the increase. And crude oil volume declined 24% compared to the second quarter of last year, with price spreads, again, negatively impacting Bakken volume. Our coal revenue increased 1% on a 1% increase in volume and a/1% improvement in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 2% as demand from lower inventories and higher natural gas prices partially offset our previously reported legacy contract loss. Volume was also impacted by network fluidity challenges. Colorado/Utah coal tonnage was up 11%, benefiting from increased demand in the western part of our network, and we continue to see strength from other coal-producing regions where tonnage was up 12% for the quarter. In our Industrial Products business, a 12% increase in volume combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car to produce 16% revenue growth. Nonmetallic minerals led to growth in IT, again, with volume up 21% for the quarter. Frac sand used in shale-related drilling drove the increase with shipments up more than 25% versus last year. Our lumber shipments were up 17% in the quarter. We were encouraged to see improvement in the housing markets driving continued lumber demand. Finally, construction products shipments were up 15% as demand for aggregates and cement continue to be strong, particularly in Texas and California. Turning to Intermodal. Revenue was up 16% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in volume and 3% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal volume was up 12% in the quarter. New premium services and continued highway conversions contributed to our volume gains. Our international Intermodal volumes were up 13%. Imports to West Coast ports rebounded in the second quarter after declining earlier in the year. We believe some portion of the strength in the second quarter can be attributed to cargo owners advancing shipments ahead of the July expiration of the ILWU contract. So it is possible that some of our traditional peak international demand has already moved. Let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the second half of 2014. In Ag Products, strength from last year's crop is carrying into the third quarter, and early signs point to another good crop year later this year. If we have another good crop year, we should have a strong second half in grain, but remember that our comp gets much more difficult in the fourth quarter. We also see continued demand for ethanol. The current forecast for ethanol production is 14.1 billion gallons for the year, which would be a record for the U.S. We expect Automotive production and sales to continue to be strong in the second half of 2014, which will drive both finished vehicle and auto parts demand. Most of our Chemicals market should continue to remain solid throughout 2014, though we think crude oil spreads will continue to be a headwind. Low inventory levels and higher natural gas prices will drive demand for coal in the third quarter. As always, weather conditions this summer will also influence demand. We will be better positioned to meet demand as our operational efficiencies improve. In our Industrial Products business, frac sand will continue to benefit from shale-related activity. We think the strength in construction products will also continue, particularly in Texas and California. And we are cautiously optimistic that the housing market will strengthen in the second half of the year, driving our lumber shipments. We think strong demand will continue in Domestic Intermodal as highway conversions and new product offerings drive growth. International Intermodal should benefit from an improving economy, though volumes in the third quarter could moderate because of the advanced shipments we saw in the second quarter. The economy got off to a slow start this year, but it is showing signs of the modest strengthening we expected. Our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across the broad portfolio of business. If the economy cooperates, we expect a strong second half of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, we set first half records in 2 of our 3 major reportable metrics and improved in all 3 year-over-year. Our first half reportable personal injury rate of 1.01 set a first half record and improved 6% versus 2013. The team's commitment to risk reduction in Courage to Care and the Total Safety Culture overcame a challenging operating environment. In terms of rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 4% to 2.95 and also set a first half record. Continued investments in our infrastructure and advanced defect detection technology drove a reduction in track and equipment-induced derailments. We also made progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions. In public safety, our grade-crossing incident rate improved slightly versus 2013. To make continued progress, we are focused on improving or closing high-risk crossings, as well as reinforcing public awareness through our use of targeted safety campaigns. In summary, the team has made terrific progress towards getting every one of our 47,000-plus employees home safely at the end of each day despite adverse weather conditions and the risk that comes with a stressed network. Moving on to network performance. In April, we discussed the impact the polar vortex had on first quarter operations. Starting the second quarter, we generated sequential performance improvement while growing volumes. By late May, we felt we were well-positioned to continue to make incremental advancement. Unfortunately, flooding severed a number of key quarters in June, including our east-west mainline, impacting our ability to generate the improvement we anticipated. The episodic weather events were compounded by an increase in track maintenance work and interchange fluidity issues. And as Jack noted earlier, while we were pleased to see increased demand, the network was challenged to absorb the stronger volumes while performing at sub-optimal levels. Fortunately, we were able to use our unique franchise to mitigate some of the impact. We adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards and gateways and moved resources to where they were most needed. Using surge resources, we've increased our active locomotive fleet by more than 800 units and our total TE&Y workforce by around 800 since last fall, and we have more resources on the way. We've roughly doubled our TE&Y hiring plan from our original expectations and now plan to hire 3,200 TE&Y employees for the full year to cover both attrition and growth. In addition, we've added $150 million to this year's capital plan, which now includes a total of 229 new locomotives. Our service performance fell short during the second quarter, which is reflected in the metrics we report each week to the AAR. Second quarter velocity was down 7% and freight car dwell up 12% when compared to 2013. The interruptions and subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index, a measure which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a more positive note, we were able to maintain local service within a reasonable range, registering a 93.9% Industry Spot & Pull. This metric, which reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year, measures whether a car is delivered to or pulled from a customer's facility on time. In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our resiliency. The team is working very hard to handle our customers' growing volumes while restoring the service they expect from us, and I am confident we are well-positioned to do so. Speaking of demand, as Eric noted, the volume trends we saw earlier in the year were largely sustained in the second quarter, with volume growth in each region of our network. We realized productivity with a volume growth despite the headwinds we faced during the quarter. So while we incurred some incremental costs associated with the congested network, we handled 8% volume growth with a 5% increase in regional TE&Y workforce. Productivity improved from an increase in average train lengths in all major categories and from T-Plan adjustments that reduced online work events. Our dedicated craft professionals and managers generated these results using the 5 key drivers to make a difference in safety and productivity and in serving our customers. One of those 5 key drivers is capital effectiveness. We increased our targeted 2014 capital spend back in May to around $4.1 billion. Roughly $2.4 billion of that is replacement capital, with most of that to renew our track infrastructure. We are on target for the year as roughly half of that program work is now complete. Spending for service growth and productivity will total around $1.2 billion. Capacity commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. This year's forecasted new capacity includes 56 miles of double track on the Sunset Route and another 300 million or so on the southern region. The investments in the South add critical capacity and fluidity to a historically constrained part of our network. We are also accelerating investments to support growing volumes in our north/south corridors. We're purchasing 229 locomotives, more than 400 freight cars, as well as 5,000 domestic containers. Spending on Positive Train Control will total about $450 million for the year. All of these projects positively impact safety, whether they support replacement, service or growth. And the growth capital projects must meet aggressive return thresholds in order to be funded. To wrap up, our first order of business is to safely improve network performance while serving customer demand. We are working hard to provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high level of service. As I mentioned in April, our recovery is partly dependent on interchange fluidity, so we continue to work with our connecting railroads to improve performance at key gateways. We expect to generate record safety results on our way towards an incident-free environment. Our investments in surge resources and network capacity have proved invaluable as we handle network challenges, service interruptions and increased demand. Our focus on reducing variability in the network has never been more important to generating sequential improvement. Ultimately, safety and service will drive our ability to leverage unit growth to generate solid productivity, all of which creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight: Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 10% to an all-time record of more than $6 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.8 billion, increasing 6% over last year. Although operating challenges in our recovery efforts did increase costs during the quarter, our operating income still grew 17% to a record $2.2 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $22 million, down 4% from 2013. Interest expense of $138 million was up 4% compared to the previous year, primarily driven by increased debt issuance during the first half of 2014. Income tax expense increased to $789 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 17% versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best-ever quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share, up 21% versus last year. Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 10% to a quarterly record of just under $5.7 billion. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 8% and core pricing gains of just under 2.5%. Business mix was about 0.5% unfavorable as the positive mix impact in grain and frac sand volume was more than offset by the increase in Intermodal and shorter haul aggregate and cement shipments during the quarter. Other revenue increased 12% in the quarter. Primary drivers included subsidiary-related volume growth, as well as the change in the way we handle per diem revenue on auto parts containers, which Eric just mentioned. Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. As we pointed out on our first quarter call, 2014 is a legacy light year, so we are not seeing the 0.5 of legacy benefit, which we achieved in 2013. Even without this legacy tailwind, our core pricing gain for the quarter was just under 2.5%. This was up slightly from the first quarter and also continue to exceed inflation, which remains low as we expected. We remain committed to a strategy of pricing to market at reinvestable levels that are above inflation. This enables us to earn the returns necessary for continued investment in our franchise. Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 5% versus 2013. Higher volumes and inflation were the primary drivers of the increase, along with some increased costs associated with running a less than optimal network. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 1% when compared to 2013. However, the reduction in the number of employees associated with capital projects helped to offset some of the increase in non-capital-related workforce levels. If you exclude capital-related employees, our workforce was actually up approximately 2.5%, with just over half of this increase coming into TE&Y. For the full year in total, we plan to hire about 5,000 people to cover growth and expected attrition of just under 4,000. This total includes the TE&Y hiring, which Lance mentioned earlier. Over the long run, as we hire and train new employees for growth and attrition, we expect to see our workforce levels increase with volume, but not at the same rate. Lastly, we still expect labor inflation to come in under 2% for the full year. Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $923 million, up 7% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher gross ton-miles associated with increased volumes. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price was flat at $3.10 per gallon. Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $636 million due to volume-related subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $470 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our 7% to 8% full year guidance. Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $316 million, which was up 5% when compared to 2013. Higher freight car rental expense was partially offset by lower freight car and container lease costs, resulting from the exercise of purchase options on some of our leased equipment. Other expenses came in at $228 million, up $9 million versus last year. Year-over-year improvement in our freight damage costs and environmental expense was more than offset by increases in our property tax expense. For 2014, we still expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items. Turning to our operating ratio performance. Pricing the business at reinvestable levels and strong demand continues to drive our results. We achieved a quarterly record operating ratio of 63.5%, improving more than 2 points when compared to 2013. Through the first half of the year, we have achieved a 65.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 2.2 points over last year. We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation and improving overall financial returns. Turning now to our cash flow. Record first-half earnings resulted in cash from operations of over $3.2 billion. This is roughly flat with 2013, reflecting primarily the headwind this year in bonus depreciation and the timing of cash tax payments. Capital invested totaled $2.2 billion year-to-date. This includes about $260 million for the buyout of the financed lease on our headquarters building, which was put in place back in 2004 and is in addition to this year's $4.1 billion capital plan. In addition, we returned $776 million in dividend payments to our shareholders. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $1.1 billion since the first of the year, bringing our adjusted debt balance to $13.9 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio to 39.4%, up from 37.6% at year end 2013. We continue to work towards our targets of an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 40% and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5. Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. As you may recall, our new repurchase authorization of up to 120 million shares post-split over 4-year time period went into effect January 1 of this year. Since the first of the year, we've bought back 16 million shares totaling about $1.5 billion. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 228 million shares. When you combine dividend payments with our share repurchases, we returned over $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year alone. These combined payments represented a 51% increase over 2013, again demonstrating our continued commitment to increasing shareholder value. So that's a recap of the second quarter results. As we look to the remainder of the year, continued strength in the economy, solid core pricing at reinvestable levels above inflation and improvement in network performance will help us achieve margin improvement, record financial results and strong returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jack. John J. Koraleski: Okay. Thanks, Rob. As we move into the second half of the year, our network velocity and fluidity are improving, which will better position us to serve the strong demand we're currently seeing in the marketplace. With our increased capital budget of $4.1 billion, we are committed to invest in the resources necessary to run a safe, efficient, reliable railroad, which supports our value proposition for our customers, and we're optimistic about the second half of the year. As always, we are closely monitoring the economic landscape, along with the major drivers across all of our business segments, including the potential impact that weather could have on grain and coal. As the economy gradually continues to improve, the power of our diverse franchise is providing business growth opportunities in all of our commodity groups. The men and women of Union Pacific are committed to safely improving our network performance, allowing us to provide customers with the excellent service they deserve while rewarding our shareholders with increasing returns. So with that, we're going to open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I wanted to chat a little bit more on pricing. We saw, as you show, Rob, in your slides, the core price metrics started to tick up again. Assuming that inflation doesn't fall further from here, and capacity is getting broadly pretty tight in the marketplace, do you feel like we've seen the trough in the core price metrics? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: As we've said in the past, Bill, we expect strong pricing opportunities as we see continued strength in demand reprice for reinvestability and reprice to the marketplace. We have mentioned in the past that we do have part of our escalators that are based on A-lift, which is still modest, but we've continued to see pricing opportunities as the demand strength [ph] continues. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then, Jack, I'm curious about your views on OR. You didn't mention it, but obviously, we know you've said this in the past that the guidance that you've given in the past that you're already kind of there. And if we look at third quarter, that's typically a better seasonal quarter for you than second. Of course, you wouldn't have any weather effects. So it would seem that third quarter should see a nice improvement on OR. But where do you think the wall is, if you will? Is there a limit? Is there a number you worry about or you think that's about as good as we can do? Or is that just really a theoretical, and we're not even close? Eric L. Butler: You know what, we're not seeing a wall at this point in time. Rob has said many times, Bill, that when we reached our guidance of sub-65, we'll move on from there and continue. We're -- every time we look at productivity, core pricing, the opportunity is to grow our business, the reinvestment that we're making in our infrastructure to support that growth at profitable levels. We are enthusiastic about our ability to do better on operating ratio. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: So I wanted to get your take on some of the implications of the BN service issues, just because they're continuing, I think, longer than maybe some had expected at the beginning of the year. Do you think this is creating more longer-term or maybe permanent market share gains? And you think there is an opportunity for kind of incremental share gains next year? And then just wondering if you're seeing any competitive response from them on the pricing side that could limit some of the pricing opportunities. John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: So we -- I've said BN is a strong competitor. They're a capable competitor. I have said they will get their network back, and we are taking them at their word. We're in a competitive marketplace, and we continue to see them being an effective competitor in the future. We -- as always, we look for -- we focus on business development, and we look for opportunities that we could price effectively. It works well with our network, and we're focused on that, and we're focused on that for the long term. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Yes. I mean, that's all fair. I mean, clearly, when we look at the volume between you and BN, clearly, there's been some share shift. Maybe I'm not asking for specific conversations, but what are you hearing from customers? Do you think that, that's going to stick with you? And do you think that -- could there be opportunities for more of it? John J. Koraleski: Scott, I think you're seeing some of both. I think there are some places where we've been able to pick up some share. And of course, the opportunity for us is to demonstrate to customers the power of our franchise, the ability to provide safe, reliable, consistent service day in and day out. And we're hopeful that, that has some stickiness to it and that, that business will hang with us even as the BNSF recovers. There are some other business where -- basically, our franchise isn't quite as strong as theirs to the end market location. And in all likelihood, as the BNSF service returns, and they're able to take the business back, it's going to shift back to them. So I think you see some of both. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then just last thing on coal, volumes have been struggling recently. I'm guessing that's more of a rail service issue than a demand issue. Any way of putting some numbers around how much coal you think you're missing out on because of some of the network issues and how much pent-up demand there could be once the network is back up and running? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: As you said, we are seeing strong coal demand. And I think as Lance and Rob both said in their prepared remarks, we did have network fluidity challenges. Weather and natural gas pricing will determine the demand in the future. But at this point, we've seen pretty good upside demand from our current run rate of coal volumes. Robert M. Knight: Scott, if I could just jump in, this is Rob. What I would look to is the inventory levels are still below where the utilities would like them to be, I mean, if you look at it on a 5-year average. So as we are in the throes of the winter -- or excuse me, the summer air-conditioning burn season, with low inventories, we think that gives us increasing opportunities. John J. Koraleski: Yes. In fact, Scott, if you looked at those numbers, in May, it was like 19 days below, and in June it's dropped to 16. So there has been some improvement in the inventory levels, but there's still a lot of opportunity for us as we see the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : As a follow-up to the kind of core pricing discussion earlier, could you elaborate in terms of where you're seeing that acceleration come? Has this been driven by the market share gains that you've had? Any sort of incremental color you could provide would be helpful. Eric L. Butler: I think we've said in the past that a portion of our business in the -- about 30% of our business is really repriceable at any one period of time. And I think pretty much across the board, with strong demand, we're seeing the opportunities for price improvement. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : That's helpful. And then a clarification with regard to the hiring that you guys had discussed, it sounded like that's a net incremental 1,000 employees, with 5,000 being hired for growth. But then you got 4,000 in attrition. Am I thinking about that right? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes. That's exactly right. It's not an exact number, but what we're basically saying is fairly high hiring numbers, fairly high attrition rate, and the net number will ultimately be driven by what the volume ends up being because we still squeeze out and expect to squeeze out productivity. But it's a high-class problem for us as volume grows for us to continue to increase our hiring levels. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And Rob, as a clarification, what volume are you guys expecting in the back half with that 1,000 additional headcount? Robert M. Knight: Yes. Great question. I mean, we're obviously not going to give that guidance other than we do see, as Eric walked through, a lot of optimistic opportunities for us. So without giving a specific number, we hope the economy continues to cooperate, not only for the balance of this year, but as we head into 2015. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Eric, can you just dig in a little bit on the comments on the preshifting and your thoughts beyond Intermodal as we head in not only the next couple of months but maybe even into the back half of the year, just given what level you thought was preshift? And what do you think the outcome of that is over the next couple of months? Eric L. Butler: Ken, as we said, our international Intermodal was up about 12% in the second quarter. I would say, going into this year, we probably would have expected a 3%, 4%, 5% improvement in second quarter, and we clearly were above that. And so we think that most of the increase beyond that was not necessarily organically marked for a business driven but related to the free shipping. And so we think that it will not probably impact the volumes in the third quarter. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then your thoughts on CapEx. I know, Lance, you delved into a lot of the detail of different projects. But when you think about this level of volumes and the speed, and obviously, CapEx takes time to roll in. Is the concern in the near term about ability to handle, whether it's pinch points or ability to keep pace with the volume growth that you're seeing right now, given that you're kind of almost at your targets for your weekly carload growth? Lance M. Fritz: Yes. So Ken, we feel confident that our network can handle that kind of volumes that look like they're coming our way as we proceed through the second half. Our capital plan is targeted at specific bottlenecks and constraints. It's coming to fruition as we would like it to. And so going forward, we feel pretty good about being able to handle the volumes that we're seeing. John J. Koraleski: Yes, Ken, this is Jack. In fact, right now, we're moving some of the strongest volume we've seen all year, and yet, our operating statistics in performance is improving. So we feel really good about that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just as a follow-up to the last question's discussion. Is it fair -- I know that you guys are bringing on some additional headcount and locomotives, but you're also expecting network velocity to improve and benefit from some productivity gains. So if I think about incremental margins in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, is it possible or fair to say that we could see an acceleration from the 58% that you posted in 2Q? Not that, that wasn't a good number, of course. John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Well, Allison, as you know, we don't give guidance on that. But we're -- the entire team is focused on, in fact, making improvements everywhere we can. I mean, if the economy cooperates, that's a great opportunity for us to move. Bill's very strong volumes gives Eric a chance to price it right. Lance has talked about the improvements that we're progressing and, in fact, seeing in our operating efficiency, which should help us on the cost side. So we're focused on doing that. I'm not going to give guidance on that number, but we're focused on improving our margins. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And with respect to the sequential improvement in pricing and the 30% of your book that's sort of tariff-based, what could we see in the back half of the year? Is there a potential to see another 50 basis points or something like that potentially by the end of the year as a result of more upward adjustments on spot business? John J. Koraleski: Allison, that's way too specific. We're not going to go down that line. We are going to continue, as we said, to price to the market and to have reinvestability as our threshold, and we've got it headed in the right direction. Operator : Our next question comes on the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Rob, if I could ask you about the repurchase activity in the quarter certainly seem to step up quite nicely, and you think out over the course of the next several quarters and maybe into the next year or so. As you're approaching some of your leverage targets, you're getting closer to that. Can we see a sustained level kind of in line with what we saw in the second quarter? Was that a bit of a catch-up or a trough? I just want to get a rough sense of maybe how you think about the pace of that repurchase activity going forward. Robert M. Knight: Yes, and as you know, we don't give guidance as to what we're actually going to buy. But I would say there was nothing unusual in the second quarter other than we continue, a, starts with generating strong cash in the front end, which is our entire team's focus, that gives us then the opportunity to reward shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchase program as we were in the second quarter. So I can't give you a precise number, but we felt pretty good about what we were able to do in the second quarter under that philosophy, while at the same time, reinvesting in the business with a strong capital program and with an increased dividend payment that you saw year-over-year. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Sure. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then if I could just get you guys -- just curious to get your take on the crude-by-rail rules or the proposal that came out yesterday. Just getting a rough sense of maybe how you think about that 2-year time frame. And maybe some of the other puts and takes that are in there seemed relatively okay. The time lines seemed a bit tight relative to our expectations, but just curious, your take on that? John J. Koraleski: Chris, I'm kind of there with you. There was really not anything in there that was totally a surprise to us. We have been actively involved with the Department of Transportation, the AAR and others in helping to do everything we can to make what is already a safe product safer. And so some of the ideas that are in that NPRM have already been implemented and some that are still there that we still need to work with. And so we want to be a voice at the table. The 2-year time frame -- the time frame really just revolves around what is the capacity in the industry to rebuild and to build new tank cars, and 2 years does feel a little tight. And if we go too far down that path, and then that's -- some product isn't going to be able to move, which is not the right solution. But so far, I have to say that I think we've got a good track record of having thoughtful approaches to this, and we're looking forward to sitting down again and filing our comments, sitting down with Secretary Fox and others to work through what is the right solution here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I guess, coming back on the pricing question, just talking a bit more broadly, I heard -- I think it was Jack or it might have been Eric saying, sticking to your approach of pricing in line with inflation. A number of your competitors have taken a little bit a step further now and looking a little bit more at yield management and focusing on customers that perhaps are not pulling their entire weight and looking a little bit more on return on invested capital as the metric by customer as opposed to pure pricing. Eric, have you looked at doing that? And I guess, I'm asking the question in the context of Intermodal, specifically with the tightening truck market. Could there be opportunities that just a blanket price in line with inflation is not the right approach but rather looking at it from a more opportunistic perspective, given some of the tighter capacity constraints that are going on, particularly in trucking but across your entire book business? Eric L. Butler: Walter, I'm not sure. Hopefully, we have not given an indication that our pricing strategy is to price in line with inflation. Our pricing strategy is to price to the market at reinvestable levels, which basically means to make sure all of our business is generating an effective return on investment. So that's the strategy that we've had for a number of years. We think it's the right strategy. We think it's helping to drive the financial results we're producing, and we're committed to that strategy. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And then specifically on particular markets, notably trucking, where perhaps the pricing might have not been where you wanted to be, can we potentially see an uptick in pricing in those areas driven by the tighter trucking market? I guess, it's where I'm going. Eric L. Butler: Yes. We do see the trucking market tightening, the CSA drivers are tightening. The trucking market is an effective competitor for a wide swath of our business, not just Intermodal business. And certainly, as their costs go up, that gives us opportunity to see more demand for our network, and we're seeing that, and we have been seeing that, and we're going to continue to price to the market based on that. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. My second question here is just more of a broader question and certainly for you, Jack. There have been talk a little bit, and I heard you referenced the dependence on your partner on the other side for turning assets or your interchange partner. There has been talk about potentially, down the road, improving service broadly for the railroad industry through a cross-the-Mississippi type of merger. Is that something that you just think is not on the table from a regulatory approval standpoint? Or is that something we as investors should think about? It might -- obviously, not in the near-term but perhaps a little further down the road as a viable opportunity. John J. Koraleski: I think that's pretty much off the table. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : A question of a different kind. I want to focus a little bit on cash. Going back historically, you generally don't have less than $1 billion of cash on the books. And I'm just looking, you're down about $700 million from where you were cash-wise a year ago. And I know a lot of that's gone to CapEx, share repurchase and dividends. If you're going to stay within the boundaries of the growth targets you're at, is there a cash level you want to stay at? And we would assume that if the share repurchase were to continue at this level, it would have to result in more debt? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes, Jeff. I mean, as you know, we are -- we and most companies in Corporate America are holding more cash today than maybe historical numbers would have suggested. But I wouldn't get too hung up on quarter end cash balances from one quarter to the next because there's all kinds of timing issues, which really was the big explainer of some of the changes that we saw in our second quarter, whether it's tax payments, timing of tax payments year-over-year, that's all factored, that timing that we choose to do. So again, our focus -- the way I would answer that is our focus -- as I said earlier, the entire team is focused on generating quality cash from operations so that we continue to have the opportunity to reinvest in the business, continue to move our dividend up and continue to be opportunistic with share buybacks, which, I think, we, in fact, have walked our talk in terms of what we've done over the last several years. Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. So your point is that this is more of a working capital anomaly in 2Q. But I guess my question is, is there a certain level of cash you want to keep on the books? Should I think of this as kind of a bottom in terms of where you want cash to be? Robert M. Knight: No. I wouldn't look at that. I mean, it's not a hard number on the cash. Again, as you know, we're focused on improving, which we did in the second quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio. We have said we want to get to that low-40s number, and we've got a little bit room or opportunity to continue to progress in that direction. I would look more at that number. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Eric, I wanted to ask you about your Mexico franchise and the opportunities that you're seeing, both in the auto sector and with your new Intermodal facility that you have in New Mexico. Is that driving a lot of incremental growth in the system? Eric L. Butler: We're excited, Brandon, about our new Intermodal products and services, and Santa Teresa has facilitated us being able to put some new products and services in the marketplace, and we're going to look to grow that even more in the future. So we view that as upside and excitement for us. Our Mexico franchise, as we said in the past, we have the premier Mexico franchise with 6 border crossings, and we're continuing to focus and invest in strengthening our Mexico franchise with all of our Mexican rail partners. So that's going to be an area of focus for us in the future. As you suggest, auto manufacturing in Mexico is growing historically. They've been, call it, 1.5 million to 2.5 million vehicles a year. They are projecting over the next 3, 4, 5 years a growth of 4 million cars a year production in Mexico with all of the new plants. As anything, really what's going to drive the level of our auto business in the future is sales because wherever the car is produced, hopefully, we'll have a chance to move it, given the strength of our franchise. So growing the absolute number will really still depend on what's happening with automotive sales. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I appreciate that, Eric. And Lance, I wanted to ask about network velocity and obviously the favorable leverage you've been getting on your TE&Y headcount. Is that going to continue? Or do you need to ramp that a little bit faster to get the network to where you want to see it? And does that necessarily mean that you can't still get leverage if velocity is improving? Lance M. Fritz: Yes. So Brandon, we love to get the leverage through service improvements. Service improvements are our favorite way of kind of leveraging growth. If you look back at the second quarter, we leveraged the growth, but we were behind the eight-ball when it came to our service product. As we look forward, the addition of resources, like labor, are going to help us improve our service product, and we still expect to get leverage productivity off the volume as we add that labor. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : When we look out to the third quarter, I was just curious, when you look at your base plan for putting more locomotives into play, calling more people back to work, what's your base plan for the ag crop? Because it seems to me that if the ag crop is good again, you could have increased demands on both you and your western partner, and we all know that BN hasn't had a good time of it this year. So I'm just curious what sort of the base outlook you have for the crop is? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: So Jason, the latest reports from the Department of Ag says that the corn crop is as good as it's been in the last 20 years. There's still weakness in the wheat crop, but if you're talking about the corn crop, we're expecting and, I think, the Ag -- Department of Agriculture estimates suggests that we're looking at perhaps another record corn crop year, which, again, will say that the transportation network will see strong demand for moving that. We feel pretty good about where we are with that. We have ramped up to handle the incremental demand from last year's record corn crop, and we are in a position to maintain that level if the crop comes in that strong. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned to handle that potential demand. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Very good. And if I can go back to pricing, given how tight the truckload market and that we've seen the carriers now take rates up every chance that they can sort of get their hands on, should we look at sort of your core pricing here in 2Q as maybe the bottom for the year as you get a chance to reprice some of this Intermodal business going forward? Eric L. Butler: Jason, so again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but we're continuing to look at a pricing environment that we think is strong, and we're going to price to the market in showing that business is reinvestable, and that's our focus. That will continue to be our focus. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Well, let me ask it a different way, then. You said that about 30% of your business, at any given time, may be up for pricing. Out of that 30%, how much is Intermodal? Eric L. Butler: We don't go into that level of specificity, typically. Robert M. Knight: Jason, this is Rob. I mean, we're not going to give a specific pricing guidance other than the tenets of our strategy remain in a strong force, and that is the price-to-market at a minimum reinvestable levels above inflation. And clearly, a strong environment, a strong demand environment is better than a weak demand environment. So we will look to move numbers and price appropriately everywhere across the business, whether it's Intermodal or Other. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I had a question about all of the operating challenges you faced in the second quarter, which sounded fairly substantial, yet the operating ratio was absolutely spectacular. Do you want to share with us perhaps the cost of all of that flooding and all of the congestion that remains from the winter, et cetera? And perhaps, what the quarter would've looked like had you not had those operating challenges? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes. John, I mean, I'm not giving the specific number, and it's hard to exactly split the hairs between was it -- or was it the weather, was it adding process as result of some of the challenges that Lance talked about. It was kind of all of the above, and they were -- without giving a precise number, they were somewhat meaningful, if you will. I mean, look at our labor line, you look at some of the purchased services, you look at some of the other cost items, they were in there. So your point is well-taken that had we not incurred those costs, things could have been slightly better, and I think you're focused on the right thing that we did a good job of improving our margins in spite of some of those challenges. And some of those challenges clearly were brought on by a very strong ramp-up in volumes so that helped, of course, contribute towards the positive volume and margin improvement. So again, without breaking out the numbers, we think that does give us an opportunity. If the economy stays strong and demand stays as strong as it is, for us to make the improvements that Lance talked about, for us to continue to improve our returns in our margins. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. Second question related to some of the capital investments that you're making on the southern part of the network where you've had some capacity challenges over the last couple of years. As that area appears to be right on top of the area that will be ultimately supporting a lot of new investment in chemical, petrochemical plants, refineries, things of that nature, where do we stand in the build-out of all that chemical industry infrastructure? And when do you expect to start to benefit from traffic emanating out of those facilities or the expanded facilities? John J. Koraleski: John, I think overall, we're really expecting that the investment in the chemical industry really starts to hit our network sometime in the 2016 kind of -- 2016, '17 kind of zone. That's when we see the bulk of it. And certainly, the investments we're making today are anticipating some of that as we see not only because of the oil business and things like that, but also everything else that's happening in our southern region. Lance, do you want to... Lance M. Fritz: Yes. I would remind you that the beauty of the investments that we're putting down in the southern region is that they can be broadly utilized for different commodity groups. You point out, one, the Chemicals franchise, we're/using them right now for our strong grain shipments down to the Gulf, and we can use them for many, many frac sand. It's beautiful to leverage that capital that way. John J. Koraleski: And we have a very important project going on right now. It's one of the biggest congestion points on our railroad called Tower 55. We're about halfway through that project. We'll have it done by probably the 1st of September or around that point. But getting that bottleneck out of our network before this business starts to come on stream is an important step forward to us as we look ahead. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein Research. David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Eric, as you think about the RPU development in Intermodal, could you talk a little bit about how mix played in there? You had very good growth in international and domestic. Was the -- would you say mix is kind of a headwind to the RPU development? Or neutral? Or maybe a little bit of a tailwind? Eric L. Butler: Mix was a little bit of a headwind in the second quarter, really, for some of the new products and services that we put in place. We're shorter haul than some of our traditional long-haul international Intermodal business and domestic Intermodal business. But it was just phenomenal in the second quarter. David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : And within that domestic Intermodal business, we hear a lot about chassis problems, particularly around some of the international moves and the potential for driver shortages to maybe make it more difficult to get some of the retail products in the market. Are you seeing some of those pressures as well? Or you guys been able to kind of manage through that, those sort of first-mile, last-mile challenges without a lot of problems? Eric L. Butler: I think we are seeing some of those pressures, nothing that's beyond our ability to manage through on a tactical basis. We do have some major initiatives underway to really address making our first-mile, last-mile process a lot more effective. And one of the good things about the challenges that you see kind of in the dray network with the driver shortage is that it really emphasizes to go rail as long as you can and as far as you can on the rail network. So we do think we're going to see some upside from that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division : You talked about the 229 locomotives that are coming on in 2014. I was wondering if you could talk about the timing of these deliveries over the course of the year. And also, as you look into 2015, do you have a rough idea right now of how many locomotives you'll need relative to this year in terms of new orders? John J. Koraleski: Lance? Lance M. Fritz: Sure. So we are receiving locomotives in the second half of the year. It's a good portion of that 229. And if you look out into 2015, we have not solidified our plans yet, but we could very well be in the market in 2015. Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And secondly, in June, you announced a ramp of your premium Intermodal service from Chicago to the West Coast. I was wondering if you could talk about the mix of your Intermodal business. Do you expect to bring more of your Intermodal volumes in-house over time? Or do you think that mix between what you handle internally versus working with the IMCs will stay about the same? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: Yes. So we have hardly none of our Intermodal business today that we do outside of IMCs. IMCs are our strategy, our market channel strategy to go to market. We do have an internal IMC that is focused on the auto parts business subsidiary, UPDS. But other than that, we -- our market channel strategy today is to work with IMCs. Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And there's no plans to change that going forward? John J. Koraleski: None at this time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I have a couple of questions around locomotive productivity and fuel burned. We did see a modest improvement in the second quarter, and I'm wondering with the additional locomotives being added in the second half, should we anticipate the consumption rate to pick up near-term or -- and then possibly trend down again longer-term? John J. Koraleski: Lance? Lance M. Fritz: Yes, sure. So new locomotives are actually a benefit to sea rate. But there's just -- I don't think there's going to be enough new locomotives coming online in the second half to measurably show up in sea rate. I will tell you that I'm pretty proud that we got some sea rate reduction, which is improvement in the first half, given the fact that our network was a bit sluggish, and we pulled out a fair number of stored locomotives that are not our most fuel-efficient locomotives. So that just demonstrates that our activity on sea rate is getting traction, and I expect that to continue. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then did you have like a longer-term target where you think your fuel consumption rate would be, given that the newer locomotives that your garage are going to be adding over time? Lance M. Fritz: Sure. Better. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. All right. If I could just add, I had a question on your comment earlier on labor attrition. Is there any particular reason behind it? Is it just simply retirements? Lance M. Fritz: It's primarily retirements. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then with retirements, could we assume that with your new hires that there should be an incremental unit labor cost sort of benefit? John J. Koraleski: Not really. Rob, you want to comment on that? Robert M. Knight: Yes, John. I mean, given the labor agreements, no, there really isn't a meaningful -- we incur, when we hire somebody, some training and hiring costs, but in terms of the ongoing wage, there's no real difference. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : I have a couple of quick questions on longer-term capital deployment. Rob, I believe you mentioned purchasing some leased equipment. Could you expand on this strategy? What portion of the equipment is currently leased? And was it just optimistic or a shift in ownership strategy? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes, it's an ongoing, I mean, where it makes economic sense for us to take advantage of some of the markets and long-term deals. So I wouldn't read anything into that. There's no shift in strategy. It's just we're sort of opportunistic we're able to take advantage of that in the second quarter. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : And CapEx, longer-term -- CapEx to fulfill PTC mandate is still quite high this year, rounding to $0.5 billion, I think. Given the reality of the implementation schedule, how do you now see the PTC spend fading over the next several years? And when PTC slips to maintenance rather than build-out, do you expect to step down in total CapEx? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes. I mean, just to remind you what we've said in terms of our total capital spend for positive train control is going to be in the neighborhood of $2 billion-ish total. We're spending, to your point, planning to spend about $450 million this year, which is the high watermark thus far on our spend. We -- the deadline, we'll see what the date actually ends up being. But if it's -- if the deadline gets moved back, our expectation is to spend -- on the capital side, we'll still be in that $2 billion neighborhood. We don't want it to shift the deadline and result in higher spending, so we're very focused on that. To your point in terms of what might shift, we've said before -- you perhaps had heard me say before that will be an ongoing expense in our OE [ph], and that shows up most notably in depreciation, which, in fact, we're starting to see that in our numbers this year. So as we start to depreciate those new PTC assets, you will see an increase in our depreciation expense related to that. And again, we are seeing some of that this year. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : All right. This is kind of a devilish question, but if you haven't had to make the PTC spend, what do you think you would have bought with that money? Or would have CapEx just been lower? Robert M. Knight: I would just say it is all return based. I mean, I wouldn't -- don't have a clean answer to that other than we didn't back off on spending other worthwhile projects on our network where the returns were there, and we were confident. So it's not as if it was a simple trade-off there. We'll always look at -- as we look at capital spending, we'll always look at our business case and the expected returns that we will expect to generate out of those capital investments. And that's all included in the guidance that we've given out in the 16% to 17% of revenue as we look forward. That's not how we build our capital budget, but that's kind of a guiding light of how we expect to size up our capital spending as we look forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean of Macquarie. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research : Also a question on Intermodal. Could you share with us your insight into the main pockets of growth opportunity, maybe across service offerings or types of customers, especially with the West generally seen as a more mature market than the East, and your numbers are obviously proving that wrong this quarter? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: We're seeing pretty good growth across the breadth of the Intermodal market, whether you're talking about motor carriers or brokers. I think the western part of the U.S., if you want to consider it West of the Mississippi, probably has as much or more opportunity as the Eastern part because we have longer hauls, which should make it easier for -- to make the conversion from truck to rail. So I think we're seeing strength pretty much across the breadth of our Intermodal customers. John J. Koraleski: We're also hopeful, Cleo, that our investment in the Santa Teresa facility will draw truck traffic that's moving today from Mexico into the U.S. to our Intermodal facility in Santa Teresa, and then we can move it east or west from that point. So we're pretty excited about that market opportunity as well. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research : And the second question has to do with resource management, your view on management of resources to manage variability spikes in demand like we've experienced so far this year. Has this experience of the winter and the sheer volume led you to consider strategic changes in how you look at asset ownership? Or are you managing through it as a tactical way to -- within the same strategic framework that you are happy with? John J. Koraleski: I think our performance for the first half of the year has been quite good, given what we had to face in terms of the weather conditions and the congestion it caused nationwide on the rail industry. I think one of the things that you've seen, and I think one of the earlier questions about how did we get to the 63 operating ratio here in the second quarter, is because over the years, we have really shifted our approach. We have become much less reactionary and much more anticipatory. And so as we see things starting to develop on the horizon, we immediately start a planning phase that says, \"We're going to mobilize materials. We're going to mobilize people where they need to be. We're going to be doing some alternative scenario planning as the way to minimize disruption to our network and to our customer service levels.\" And I think that shift to anticipating is really what's been kind of the key behind some of our performance, certainly in the first half of the year. And so we're -- we learn something from every event. We learn something from every thing that happens on our railroad, and our goal is to take that and work it into our planning structure so we become even more effective and better going forward. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research : Any particular pockets of tightness across your segments that you would like to comment on for next year? John J. Koraleski: Eric, what do you think? Eric L. Butler: We -- Cleo, we're seeing pretty good demand, and the -- our first look at the 2015 forecast is pretty good demand across our book of business. And so I don't think there's any one place that would stick out beyond any other places. Lance M. Fritz: And Eric, if you look at it from a network perspective, Cleo, we are investing in the areas where we anticipate we are going to be tight, and we've talked openly about investing in the southern region and also in the north/south corridors. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research : I'm just going to ask one because it's getting late here, but I wanted to ask a question on interline connectivity, which was an issue in the quarter. And I think the first half of this year has exposed the fragility of Chicago. So I just wondered if you could give some color on how much of your traffic touches Chicago and the extensive opportunities you think are out there to reasonably divert that to other interchanges over time? John J. Koraleski: Yes. I would -- so I'm going to start, Cherilyn, and just say -- I think if you look at Chicago, I don't know that I would necessarily describe it as fragility. I think Chicago got hammered with a snow storm about every 2 weeks and frigid cold temperatures, so it never melted, it just kept building up and building up. I think that was a key problem there. We have worked with all of our interline partners in terms of not only their fluidity but also our fluidity. We're all in this together, and so we have done a lot of redirecting out of Chicago into the St. Louis area or down to Memphis in working with our interchange partners for the mutual benefit of both of our railroads as we work through those issues. Lance, why don't you... Lance M. Fritz: Sure. So you would ask how much of our business? It's a fair portion, call it, 1/4 of our business ultimately moves through, into, out of Chicago. And when you think about our activity in Chicago, CREATE has really done a very good job of improving the Chicago gateway with interline partners. The gateway, since the start of CREATE, has improved by about 1/3 in terms of the amount of time it takes a car to traverse. And Jack mentioned it as well. We've got ongoing investments in Chicago, one of which is going to be in connection with Metro where we add a third mainline to our critical east-west route in and out of Chicago. So I'm very optimistic, both in the level of activity engagement we have with our interline partners and in the progress that we've seen. This winter was exceptional. It was an exceptional winter, and it had exceptional impacts on the railroad. And even so, volumes still continued to move through the gateway. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Eric, I just want to double check, but did I hear that you guys are planning to add 5,000 EMP and UMAX containers this year? I'm just curious, it seems like a pretty big add, or was that somewhat replacement? Eric L. Butler: Yes. So a part of it is replacement. As we discussed, our business is growing. And actually, as we look into the future, and we don't talk about this in specificity, but there's a bunch of containers that are aging out, and so we're trying to do some level-set planning and management strategically. But you can think of it as part replacement, part growth, part future level-set planning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's perfect. And then just kind of following up on that, but on the rail-controlled side. Have you guys implemented any kind of, call it, general rate increases or maybe tariff increases on that rail-owned pool of containers? Eric L. Butler: So the pricing that we're reporting in our Intermodal business, we are increasing our prices in our Intermodal business on -- whether they're rail-owned containers or private-owned containers, the pricing -- because the demand is going up, pricing is going up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : You mentioned earlier when you expect the network to be \"normal\" in the back half of the year. Did you provide a time frame? John J. Koraleski: No. Lance, do you want to comment? Lance M. Fritz: Yes. We did not provide a time frame, but what we did say is we're positioned to improve, and we expect to improve. John J. Koraleski: And we're seeing improvement... Lance M. Fritz: And we are seeing improvement as we speak. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And assuming that we do normalize before the upcoming winter, how should we think about network utilization, given the volume level that we have seen, given some of the locomotive investments and the container investments and other car-type investments that you have made? Is there -- can you provide some sort of figures as to what effective network utilization will be in kind of a steady-state or normal network fluidity environment? John J. Koraleski: It's pretty difficult to do that, Benjamin, if you think about it, because it depends on where the business comes, what kind of business it is and all that. What we can tell you is at this point in time, as we look ahead, even at the volume levels we have, we're still open for business, we still have capacity, and we're looking forward to additional growth. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments. John J. Koraleski: Well, great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you again in October. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Koraleski, you may begin. John J. Koraleski: Thank you, Rob and good morning everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we're pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved third quarter earnings of $1.53 per share, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 7% and the increases were nearly across the board. We saw growth in 5 of our 6 business groups with particular strength in Agricultural Products, Industrial Products and our Intermodal shipments. Coming out of the first half, we were pleased to see the strong volume growth continue through the third quarter. These strong volumes along with solid core pricing drove a 2.5-point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 62.3% for the quarter. And as we continue to focus on improving our service, we are encouraged by the accomplishments that we achieved in the quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric L. Butler: Thanks, Jack and good morning. Volume was up 7% in the third quarter as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in 5 of our 6 business groups. We continue to see strong gains in Ag Products, Industrial Products and Intermodal. We also saw gains in Automotive and Chemicals, and Coal volume was flat for the quarter. Core price improved over 2.5% to help average revenue per car improve 3.5%. The volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 11%, which set an all-time quarterly record of over $5.8 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products had another strong quarter and once again led our volume growth. Revenue was up 19% in the third quarter on a 14% increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloadings were up 34% this quarter as we continued to benefit from a strong U.S. supply and lower commodity prices. Export feed grain demand to Mexico, China and Southeast Asia were strong, and domestic feed grain shipments were solid across most of our franchise. We did see softer wheat exports this quarter, which partially offset our volume gains. Grain products volume grew by 6%, driven by another strong quarter in ethanol shipments. We also saw strength in canola, meal and DDG [ph] shipments. Finally, food and refrigerated segments were up 3% for the quarter, as volume increases and import beer more than offset declines in frozen foods, canned goods and import sugar shipments. Automotive revenue was up 3% in the third quarter on a 5% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 1%, driven again by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem revenue and also by mix. Strong consumer demand drove finished vehicle shipments up 5% this quarter. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American Automotive production was 16.7 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 1 million units from the same quarter in '13 and the highest level since 2006. On the parts side, strong production and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 3% volume increase. Turning to Chemicals, our revenue was up 6% for the quarter on a 2% volume increase and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. We continued to see strength in our Industrial Chemicals volume, which was up 7% in the third quarter. The demand was driven by a variety of end-use markets such as shale-related drilling and various housing-related applications. Liquid petroleum gas shipments were up 12% for the quarter, driven by new business to an LPG storage facility on our franchise. We also saw an increase in demand for fuel additive imports in Canada and propane exports to Mexico. Partially offsetting our volume gains in Chemicals was crude oil, which declined 10% in the third quarter. As previously discussed, increased production in Texas limited shipments of Bakken crude oil to the Gulf region. However, we were able to partially offset the decline from Bakken with gains from other origins. Coal revenue increased 2% on a 2% increase in average revenue per car and flat volume. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 2% for the quarter. Strong demand from lower inventories mostly offset volume headwinds from our previously reported legacy contract loss and a relatively mild summer. Volume was also negatively impacted early in the quarter from flooding in Iowa that interrupted service along our east-west main line. We continued to see increased demand in the Western part of our network, which drove Colorado/Utah tonnage up 13%. In our Industrial Products business, revenue increased 19% on a 12% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. Once again, nonmetallic minerals led to growth in Industrial Products with volume up 30% for the quarter. Frac sand shipments were up 39% as we continued to see strong demand to most shale formations. Our lumber shipments were up 15% in the quarter. While steady improvement in the housing market increased demand, we're also seeing over-the-road conversions in many markets as order sizes increase and truck capacity tightens. And we continued to see strength in construction product shipments where volume was up 11%, driven by demand for aggregates and cement. Finally, in Intermodal, revenue was up 15% driven by a 10% increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal was up 13% in the quarter. Continued demand for new premium services and highway conversions contributed to a best-ever quarter for Domestic Intermodal volume. Our International Intermodal volume was up 8% as continued economic strength and new business volume carried over into the third quarter. Similar to the second quarter, we believe some of the portion of this strength can be attributed to cargo owners advancing peak-season shipments in anticipation of a possible impasse during the renegotiations of labor contracts at West Coast ports. To wrap up, let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the remainder of 2014. In Ag Products, all signs point to another record crop for corn and soybeans this year. Although the harvest got off to a slow start, we're optimistic for a strong finish to the year in grain. Though remember that our comp gets much more difficult starting in the fourth quarter. We also think ethanol shipments will be strong and we expect continued strength for import beer. In Automotive, finished vehicles and auto parts shipments will continue to benefit from strength in production and sales. Most of our Chemicals markets should remain solid for the remainder of 2014, though crude oil will likely continue to be a headwind. Low inventory levels should drive demand for Coal in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the weather cooperates as we continue to improve operational efficiencies. In Industrial Products, we expect the strength in frac sands to continue and we remain cautiously optimistic about the construction and housing markets. New product offerings and highway conversions will drive demand in Domestic Intermodal, and we continue to believe that the International Intermodal will benefit from an improving economy. But we expect growth to moderate in the fourth quarter as we believe the international peak season is largely behind us. Overall, the U.S. economy continues to show signs of strengthening, but we are keeping a close eye on softening economies in various parts of the world. Our diverse franchise and strong value proposition will continue to support business development efforts across our network and we expect a strong finish to the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz: Thanks, Eric and good morning. Starting with safety. Our team continues to address risk in the work place and to generate record safety results. The performance is noteworthy given our current network variability. Training and deploying thousands of new employees introduces risk as the new hires get a feel for their work. We rely on each team's commitment to risk reduction, Total Safety Culture and the principles of Courage to Care to counter that risk. As a result, our year-to-date employee personal injury rate of 1.09 was 4% better than 2013 and a year-to-date record low. On a technical note, we have restated our employee personal injury rates for 2011 through 2014 year-to-date due to an overstatement of employee hours during this period. The absolute number of injuries reported was not affected. In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 7% to 3.04 and also set a year-to-date record. Continued investments in our infrastructure and advanced defect detection technology drove a reduction in track- and equipment-induced derailments. We also made progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and standard work. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased slightly versus 2013. To make continued progress, we are reinforcing public awareness through targeted safety campaigns in local communities and businesses. We are also developing analytics to assess crossing risks, which will enable us to target those with the greatest safety impact. Overall, we've made real progress on generating safety improvements on our way to an incident-free environment. The third quarter was a challenge for the operating team with significant weather events, robust volume growth and interline connectivity issues. During the third quarter, flooding and subsequent washouts on several key routes materially impacted operations. The 84 days with major service interruptions resulting from weather and incidents were the most we have ever recorded in a quarter since we first started tracking the measure back in 2005. In comparison, the average for the third quarter since 2005 has been 37 weather and incident interruption days. Variability also resulted from the construction of major capacity projects, most notably the Tower 55 project in Fort Worth, Texas. This public-private partnership, completed in late August, created operational efficiencies and additional capacity by reconfiguring and adding additional track through a key bottleneck in our network. However, a project of this magnitude required us to reroute significant train traffic to facilitate installation. Given the more-than-100 trains per day that traverse through this intersection, the reroutes placed additional pressure on the network during the quarter. Reflecting this variability, our service performance fell short during the third quarter. As reported to the AAR, third quarter velocity was down 10% and freight car dwell up 13% when compared to 2013. We have maintained velocity around 24 miles per hour while addressing these operational challenges in moving growing volumes. The team has adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards and gateways, realigned resources to where they are needed most, and employed the use of our surge resources. The interruptions and their subsequent reductions on network capacity also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a more positive note, we were able to maintain local service within a reasonable range, registering a 93.3% Industry Spot & Pull. This metric, which reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year, measures whether a car is delivered to or pulled from a customer's facility on time. Our team is working very hard to handle customers' growing volumes while improving service and we remain focused on making it happen. To support our customers' volume growth, we have increased our total TE&Y workforce by more than 1,100 employees and our active locomotive fleet by around 900 units since September of last year. And we've stepped up our resource plan throughout the year to handle growing volumes and provide the level of service that our customers have come to expect. As to our workforce, we are now planning to hire around 3,600 TE&Y employees to cover growth and attrition, up from the 3,200 we discussed back in July. Approximately 2,500 of these 3,600 have already been hired. And while some of these employees are already active in day-to-day operations, a good portion of these new hires are still in our training pipeline. Around 1,100 will be moving into active operations in the fourth quarter. We also have plans to acquire an additional 32 locomotives this year, bringing our new total to 261 units, up from 229. Around 200 of these units are now on property and deployed across the network. And a quick update on CapEx. We still plan to spend around $4.1 billion this year, including the additional 32 locomotives I just mentioned. While we are largely on schedule, timing issues on a few projects keeps our overall projection unchanged. And while we still haven't finalized our overall 2015 capital program, we do plan to acquire around 200 new locomotives next year. Our capital investments help maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and include investments in service, growth and productivity that allow us to handle growing rail volumes. Moving to productivity. The volume trends we saw in the first half of the year were largely sustained in the third quarter, with volume growth in each network region. We generated solid productivity with the volume growth despite the operational headwinds we faced during the quarter. So while we incurred some incremental costs associated with congestion, we improved network productivity by increasing average train lengths in nearly all major categories and by adjusting the T-Plan to reduce work events. The chart on the lower right demonstrates our ability to leverage growing manifest volumes through UP's terminal infrastructure. During the quarter, we switched 7% more cars with a 5% increase in yard and local employee days versus 2013. The result was an all-time quarterly record in terminal productivity. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on improving service, safety and efficiency by standardizing work and reducing variability to drive our operating ratio to an all-time record. Wrapping up. Our first order of business is to safely improve network performance while satisfying customer demand. We are working hard to provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. As I've previously mentioned, our recovery is partly dependent on interchange fluidity, so we continue to work with our connecting railroads to improve performance at key gateways. We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue to make sound investments in resources and network capacity to overcome congestion and service interruptions and to handle increased demand. Our focus on reducing variability in the network has never been more important to generating sequential improvement. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight: Thanks, Lance and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 11% to nearly $6.2 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.9 billion, increasing 7% over last year. And even though our network continues to run at suboptimal levels, our operating income still grew 19% to $2.3 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $20 million, down $8 million from 2013. Interest expense of $144 million was up 4% compared to the previous year. Primary drivers were increased debt issuance during the first 9 months of this year. Income tax expense increased to $836 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 19% versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best ever quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, up 23% versus last year. Turning to the top line. Freight revenue grew 11% to over $5.8 billion. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 7% and core pricing gains of just over 2.5%. A positive lag impact on our fuel surcharge program added approximately 1 point in freight revenue growth. Business mix added another 0.5 point as the positive mix impact in grain and frac sand volume more than offset the increase in lower average revenue per car Intermodal shipments during the quarter. Other revenue increased 12% in the quarter. Primary drivers included revenue associated with the per diem on auto parts containers as well as subsidiary-related volume growth. Recall that beginning last year, per diem revenue on auto parts containers is now reported in other revenue as a result of a change in how we are compensated for this service. Slide 22 provides more detail on the impact of changing fuel prices on our fuel surcharge revenue. Represented by the blue line, you can see how diesel fuel prices declined in August and September. Remember, there is about a 2-month lag before the price of diesel fuel actually flows to our surcharge revenue. The dashed line reflects that 2-month lag. In periods of falling fuel prices, earnings benefit from the surcharge lag. On a year-over-year basis, the surcharge lag added about $0.04 per share to our third quarter 2014 earnings. This includes $0.02 of positive impact in the third quarter of this year as well as $0.02 of negative impact during the same period last year. As we look ahead, it's hard to say what might actually happen with fuel prices. It's a little like trying to predict the economy. So whilst we've been seeing a modest benefit to start off the fourth quarter, much can change between now and near the end of the year. Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. Third quarter core pricing came in at just above 2.5%. This is up slightly from our first-half average, reflecting continued core pricing gains. And our commitment to a strategy of pricing to market at re-investable levels that are above inflation remain solidly intact. Moving on to the expense side. Slight 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 8% versus 2013. Higher volumes, inflation and increased training expense were the primary drivers of the increase along with some increased costs associated with running a less-than-optimal network. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 2% when compared to 2013. However, the reduction in the number of employees associated with capital projects helped to offset some of the increase in noncapital-related workforce levels. If you exclude capital-related employees, our workforce was up over 3% with the majority of this increase coming in our TE&Y ranks. For the full year in total, we are now revising our previous estimates. We now plan to hire over 5,500 people to cover growth and expected attrition of just under 4,000. This total does include the increase in TE&Y hiring, which Lance just discussed. From a timing perspective, about 30% of this hiring is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this year. Going forward, you should expect to see our workforce levels grow with volume, but not at the same rate of increase. Labor inflation is still expected to come in under 2% for the full year in part reflecting favorable pension expense. Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $882 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher gross ton-miles associated with increased volumes and lower diesel fuel prices. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1% while our average fuel price declined 5% to $3.01 per gallon. Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 11% to $650 million due to higher locomotive and freight car material costs, volume-related contract and subsidiary expenses, and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $481 million, up 8% compared to 2013, consistent with our 7% to 8% full year guidance. Slide 27 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $310 million, which is flat when compared to 2013. Higher volume-related freight car rental expense was offset by lower freight car and container lease costs. Lease costs are lower as a result of exercising purchase options on some of our leased equipment. Other expenses came in at $242 million, up $37 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, damaged freight and equipment costs and personal injury expense contributed to the year-over-year increase. Year-to-date other expenses are up 5%, within the range of our full year guidance of an increase between 5% and 10% excluding any unusual items. Turning to our operating ratio performance. We achieved a quarterly record operating ratio of 62.3%, improving 2.5 points when compared to 2013. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we achieved a 64.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 2.3 per [ph] points over last year. With 3 quarters now complete, we are in a solid position to achieve our long-term guidance on a full year basis of a sub-65% operating ratio this year. Turning now to our cash flow. Year-to-date cash from operations totaled nearly $5.4 billion. This is up almost 10% when compared to 2013. Recall, this amount is tempered by the headwind this year in bonus depreciation and the timing of cash tax payments. Capital invested totaled $3.3 billion year-to-date. In addition, we returned about $1.2 billion in dividend payments to our shareholders. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $1.7 billion since the first of the year, bringing our adjusted debt balance to $14.5 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio to 40.2%, up from 37.6% at year end 2013. This puts us in line with our target of an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 40%. And we continue to work towards our target of an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5. We also continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases. Since the first of the year, we've bought back over 24 million shares, totaling about $2.3 billion. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 237 million shares. When you combine dividend payments with our share repurchases, we returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareholders in the first 3 quarters of this year. These combined payments represent a 47% increase over 2013, continuing our focus on rewarding shareholders with increased cash returns. So that's the recap of our third quarter results. As we look to close out the year, we are well positioned to report a record year in many of our key financial measures. Of course, we still need the economy to cooperate, but the business fundamentals remain strong and are supported by our solid core pricing initiatives. I would also like to remind everyone that as we have previously announced, we have an Investor Day coming up in a couple of weeks on November 5 in Chicago. So as we look past 2014 and into next year and beyond, we look forward to providing you our thoughts and views at that point in time. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack. John J. Koraleski: Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, as you've heard from the team today, we're feeling pretty good about the remainder of the year. Assuming that the economy and weather cooperate, we are well positioned to finish up the year with record results. We continue to see tremendous opportunity across our diverse franchise and we remain focused on improving our network velocity and fluidity so that we can leverage these opportunities by safely providing our customers with excellent service and our shareholders with strong returns. So with that, we're going to go ahead and open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Jack, just given that I'm the first here, I guess I'm going to ask a question that you probably know is coming. There's been some discussion around M&A in the industry right now and definitely proposals to fix the service issues facing the carriers. So I know you talked about it in the last call, or said effectively you don't think M&A can happen. But do you believe that combinations of the east-west carriers could potentially alleviate some of the congestion that you're seeing right now? John J. Koraleski: Brandon, I am not convinced that merging is the way you solve service issues in this industry. And particularly right now, I don't think mergers make sense and I still believe that. I think, when you look ahead to the regulatory hurdles that are out there, the STB, the new rules basically say that any combination is going to have to enhance competition as opposed to the past when it was just maintain competition. And secondly, that they will consider the triggering effects of additional consolidations. So that really does add a whole layer of concern for me as I think about the prospects of future mergers. So I'm not a fan and I really don't believe that's the best way to fix the service situation. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Well, when you look at the overlap, though, of the networks, do you believe there's a lot of competitive overlap in some of these combinations? Or are there, potentially, combinations that could help some of these bottlenecks where you wouldn't have significant competitive concern? John J. Koraleski: When we come across bottlenecks, we work really hard with our interline partners to solve them. And I don't see that merging is the way to eliminate bottlenecks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Maybe just a question on pricing. I want to get a rough sense of sort of how you think about the pricing environment, particularly when you're looking out to 2015. Obviously, volumes are sort of getting back up towards previous peak levels. Just kind of want to get a rough sense about how you feel about that and a potential re-acceleration, if we could see one, in 2015 up from about the 2.5% you've been doing the last couple of quarters. John J. Koraleski: Chris, we like to -- what we're seeing in the marketplace today in terms of the volume that's taking place and the demand and clearly, when a market reacts that way, the pricing environment gets better. I don't know, Eric, you want to put some technical around that? Eric L. Butler: Yes, Jack, you're right. We've said in the past that as demand strengthens, we see our ability and our strong value proposition to continue to allow us to take price and we're excited about the future opportunities. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, that is helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up question, specifically as it pertains to Intermodal. You've had some fairly strong results on the Intermodal side. Just want to get a rough sense, maybe if we can parse out is there-- how we think about sort of the core business and then the competitive potential opportunities that maybe you've seen over the course of this year. And maybe if it's just sort of a mix dynamic that's playing into that Intermodal average revenue per car. Just want to get a sense of how that is trending because it seems to be a bit of a standout. John J. Koraleski: Okay. Eric? Eric L. Butler: Yes. I think we've been saying the whole year, talking about our new products and services, and as we're rolling out our new products and services, it's really driving our value proposition and our ability to convert truck, particularly long-haul truck, to the rail. And again, that value proposition continues to allow us to price to market and strengthen our prices and it's just a continuation of the trend that we've had. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And the fourth quarter, that's sort of the same dynamic, potentially, with international being a little bit maybe softer and then the domestic side continuing to do what it's been doing. Eric L. Butler: Yes. As you know, there's always kind of a cycle throughout the year in terms of the volumes quarter-to-quarter, and we expect that cycle throughout the year to be similar this year as it was previous year. But given that, yes, we see our strong value proposition and the trend to continue. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Just had a question on whether or not you all have estimated the cost of the network performance issues that you incurred in the third quarter. You were able to put up, obviously, just spectacular numbers. But I suspect that if things have been more fluid, you would've done even better than that. Any estimates on the cost of that set of challenges? And also, was there any revenue missed due to performance issues or interline issues? John J. Koraleski: Hey, Rob, why don't you take a shot at that? Robert M. Knight: Yes, John, that -- it's difficult to kind of nail that down, as you know. Roughly -- clearly, there was some cost. I'd say, it cost us probably $0.01 or so on the cost. But as we pointed out, we recognize that we didn't meet all of the demand in our Coal business, for example. So there's some revenue that, clearly, we hope to continue to make up as we move forward, but that had an impact as well. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then on the reduced year-over-year crude volumes, is there any hope for making up some of that by connecting with the Canadian carriers and hauling some of the heavy sour out of Alberta down to the Gulf Coast? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: Yes, John, as we've said in the past, our strategy is to strengthen our franchise to provide optionality between origins and destinations. We're still doing that. We're heading down that path. As you know, we don't control the flows. The spreads are going to drive that and the price of oil is going to drive that. In terms of the Canadian perspective, I certainly think that as oil goes to $85, $80, the Canadian heavies probably have more headwinds than they do at $100 or $110 price of oil. So those are all factors that will go into our crude oil opportunities in the future. John J. Koraleski: I would just add to that, John. The trade-off of a 10% down on our oil business but a 39% increase on the frac sand business is pretty darn attractive to us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So Jack, I think the company used to speak about the capacity on the network being somewhere in that 190,000, 195,000 carloads at a 4-week moving average basis. Obviously, you guys have been doing a lot in terms of double trucking [ph] parts of the network to the Tower 55 project. Can you sort of help us understand where you think the capacity situation is now with all the resources you're adding? Are we -- or do you guys feel like you're in a good position to accommodate volume growth? Do you feel like there's the potential for a more drawn out potential for service issues as the volume outlook continues to look pretty strong? John J. Koraleski: David, I actually feel pretty good about our positioning right at the moment. And I'm not backing down from the 195,000 to 200,000 kind of a range. Our capital spending on infrastructure has been excellent. Our railroad is really in the best shape it's been in, in a long time. We are adding crews I think, as you've seen in the presentation today, pretty aggressively here in the last quarter of the year and actually even into the first couple of months of next year. Our locomotive take for this year is solid and we're protected for next year. And I like all of that. We're running the 100,000 -- between 190,000 and 195,000 cars a week, week-to-week, and we are continuing to see improvement in our internal measures and our velocity and things like that. So I feel good about the fact that we're getting better even at these very strong volumes. And I think I'd stay in that 195,000 to 200,000. I think we'll be okay. David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : All right. And the results definitely support that. So Eric, maybe just as a follow-up, it looks like the growth in premium traffic, the trailer growth in the Intermodal segment there, you're picking up some business. Would you think that there's more runway to grow that? Or do you think that this is going to be sort of 1 or 2 premium accounts where you're getting a nice hit on the RPU? Or do you think that there's more potential to grow that premium service product over a longer period of time? Eric L. Butler: As you know, and as we've said in the past, we're continuing to put new products and services in the marketplace. I think we spoke at the last quarter about some of the new premium services that we put in the marketplace between Chicago and the West Coast and the TMNW [ph]. And so we certainly saw a benefit from putting those new products and services in the marketplace. We're going to continue to look at opportunities to do that, and we expect to continue to drive growth across our Intermodal book of business, including our premium business. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Real quick here. You talked a little bit about pension being a minor help this year. Given current interest rates, what are you expecting for '15? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't have all the full numbers nailed, but Jason, I think it's a safe assumption that it'll be higher next year. And as I pointed out that pension and other health and welfare items are what drove our comp inflation number to be, as I stated, below 2%. We would expect that's going to obviously drive that to a higher number next year, probably closer to 3-ish, all in. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : 3-ish, all in. Okay. Now given that and you said your core pricing was just -- I guess, just over 2.5%. Is that something that we should look to trend up, that 2.5% next year, to try to keep up with some of the additional costs that are coming on? John J. Koraleski: Rob? Robert M. Knight: Yes. I mean, I -- our philosophy, Jason, has not changed at all. And that is to price to market at re-investable levels and above inflation. So we're constantly taking advantages there, talk to where it make sense for us to bring on business at the right terms and right conditions and that -- we're not giving more detailed guidance on that other than our tenet and our focus and our belief achieving those goals has not changed. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Has it been a little bit more difficult given the service levels on some of the pricing discussions with your shippers this year? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: Jason, we operate in a very competitive environment and lots of competitive options. And getting price is always difficult, but we believe we have a value proposition and we are going forward in selling our value proposition and gaining a price for it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I wanted to ask about -- and Jack or Eric, really, the addressable market. So when you look at what's kind of going on with your operating ratio, it's getting to very impressive levels. And I realize you haven't quite gotten to low 60s on a full year basis, but you're getting to levels where I think all of us are going to sort of rightfully conclude that, well, there's probably more opportunity to go, but that opportunity set is diminishing. So could you talk about how you weigh the pros and cons of using some of that operating ratio to try to grow revenue faster? Is that something that you started thinking about, that you want to kind of start to try to win business using maybe price where appropriate? Or how do you think about this changing dynamic? John J. Koraleski: You know Bill, I don't think about my opportunities as diminishing. As I look ahead for the next 4, 5, 6 years, and we'll talk about this more on November 5, I think the Union Pacific franchise is loaded with opportunities. And I think Eric and his team are doing an outstanding job of business development. Part of our capital investment strategy, like Santa Teresa, part of it in terms of the announcement we made about moving ahead with a new facility in Robertson County down in Texas. All that's focused on growth and development. There's still huge potential for us in Mexico. I'll stop. I'll let Eric... Eric L. Butler: The only other thing I would add, and again, Jack and Rob said we'll talk more about this at the Investor Day, if you think about the shale play and the lower energy prices in this country, there is really a resurgence of activity, business activity, investment activity, manufacturing activity. And we see that continuing to be just a strong propellant for growth in the future. I mean, talking about price, using price to grow is not even in our vernacular at this point. Robert M. Knight: Bill this is Rob, I just got to add. We'll try not to have 3 people answer each question. But, I have to add that focus really for us is on returns. Operating ratio has got a shorthand target, that gives us -- brings it all together in terms of efficiency, and we use that as a measure of success, if you will. But at the end of the day, we really are focused on driving returns. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : No, that's very hopeful. Let me just clarify, because I just kind of wanted to make sure I kind of asked this in the right way. And what I'm basically getting at is I think most people would say that a long-term organic growth rate, in volume terms for rails, is probably GDP-like. Pricing will be inflation-plus if you put that at 2% or so, we'll talk about maybe a 3% number. And that kind of puts you in the mid single-digit revenue growth rate range. And I think what I'm trying to get at is, is there a way to push that higher or are what you -- maybe what you're saying is, listen, our network has much greater opportunities than that organic GDP-like level of growth. But that's what I was kind of trying to get at. John J. Koraleski: I think 2 things, Bill. One is you're right. I think we believe that our franchise has greater opportunities than that. And number two is it's not just about market and inflation. It's also about the value that you provide for the customer. How do you differentiate your service package, the options that you provide customers, the relationships that you build with them. And we think that gives us an edge. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz at UBS. Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Let's see, so I wanted to ask you about how would you compare the current environment for -- rail environments, not just UP. But current rail environments, 2004 through 2006, I guess the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak, among the western carriers in terms of maybe who has greater capacity challenges. But is it fair to say that this may be similar where it really takes a while to recover for the industry and velocity, but that supports some positive things in terms of price and perhaps a couple of years of pretty favorable pricing? John J. Koraleski: I think, Tom, that's not a bad assessment. Having been the poster child of what not to do in 2003, '04, '05, it feels better that we're where we are at the moment. But I do think, when you look across the rail industry, you're seeing incredibly strong capital investment. Almost uniformly across every property. You see operating teams that are experienced, that are working diligently to get these things working. There's a lot of interline activity between carriers that's looking at improving service and things like that. So I think it'll -- while there are some similarities to that, I'm hopeful that you're going to see a quicker return to kind of a more normal velocity than what we saw back in those days. Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. Let's see, in terms of the, I guess, getting to your own pricing opportunity, how much of your book is available to get repriced in 2015? And I guess how much of that have you already taken up, already set the repricing? John J. Koraleski: Eric. Eric L. Butler: So we've said in the past, Tom, that at any one given period of time, roughly 70% of our book of business is tied up in contracts of a year and longer. We're rolling those over at -- all the time. So I think that's a good rule of thumb to continue to use. Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. But I mean, if you said tariff, one-year letter quote plus the multi-year that rolls over, is it maybe 50% of the book you could touch for next year or is there a broad brush number you can give us for what you actually [indiscernible] next year? John J. Koraleski: If you look at it, Tom, it hasn't changed very much over the years. About 30% is in tariff, about 30% is in one-year letter quotes. But those all come up and due at different times during the year. So I think you kind of stick with what Eric told you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just want to revisit your answer then, on kind of the volumes here. To David's question before, you talked about 190,000 to 200,000, and you said you felt good about 195,000 to 200,000. But if you're growing at these levels and you're already running at 190,000, 195,000 carloads per week, do you start to face congestion if you get -- if the Ag business stays strong or what-have-you in terms of volumes? I just want to understand, do you see tightness, just given on the volume side? Understanding what you're doing on the crew and locomotive side. It just sounds like the network, at some point, hits that max or is it just based on where the volumes are coming in from? John J. Koraleski: I don't think that, that's a max for us, Ken. I think we have potential even beyond those numbers. It really does depend. I don't know, Lance, why don't you take a shot at it. Lance M. Fritz: Sure. So right now, we'd love to have more crews in our network to spool up our speed. That's probably the starting point of where current service product gets back to what we would consider an acceptable level. As we look forward, we're constantly making investment decisions in all the critical resources to be able to handle growth where we anticipate growth is going to occur. And I don't see any reason why we would say future growth is going to be retarded because those investments aren't happening in the right spots. John J. Koraleski: Nor do we think it's going to take anything more than what we've stated, which is a 16% to 17% of revenue kind of capital trend to keep us ahead of that game. Lance M. Fritz: 16% to 17%. John J. Koraleski: Yes. We're not saying it's going to take an exceptional capital infusion to keep us good. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : No, that's encouraging because it sounded like you were saying before it was kind of a max, at least for now, but that's encouraging on the ability to grow. And then maybe, Eric, thoughts on the Ag business in terms of this record crop we've had. It looks like we've got another strong crop. You said there was a delay in getting the harvest started. Can you maybe delve into that and talk about business there and what you're seeing in terms of congestion and the infrastructure there and kind of the pace of growth we should expect on the Ag side? Eric L. Butler: Yes. So last year was a record corn harvest and a good soybean harvest. This year, all indications is that it's going to be another record corn harvest. I think last year was 13.9 billion bushels. This year might be -- I think the estimates are 14.4 billion bushels. And likewise, soybeans I think are going to be up close to 4 billion bushels, which would be a record. The delay that's occurring is really the delay of farmers harvesting in the field, it's not a transportation supply chain delay. Variety of reasons for that. Some parts of the country, it's been wetter than usual. Other parts of the country, the farmers are making the decisions in terms of when they want to bring their product to market. So a variety of reasons for that. So we expect this record harvest to still -- record corn harvest to still be ahead of us in terms of harvesting and the farmers looking to put that into the supply chain, the transportation process. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : That's helpful. I appreciate the time and great results. If I could just get a clarification though, Eric, on something you said earlier. The oil that you mentioned was declining. Is that because it's moving east and west, and -- because your frac sand is going up. So I just want to understand why that downshift in the crude on your network when we're seeing such strong growth on all the others. Eric L. Butler: Yes, the crude reductions for us have been the Bakken to the Gulf and Louisiana. And if you look at the flows of the Bakken crude, that is flowing east and west and not north and south. And one of the reasons it's not flowing north and south is that there's such huge production of crude in Texas, in the basins in Texas, that it's predominantly moving by pipeline to the refineries. We have some spot rail moves but predominantly by pipeline. There really is not a need to move the Bakken crude to Texas. So that's the dynamic that we're seeing. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So following up on frac sands. So volume growth clearly accelerated in Q3. And in spite of the uncertainties surrounding crude prices, do you have any opportunities to take up price on this business, given the very tight supply? And it looks you took up some of the public tariff rates on this business. I was wondering if you could comment on what percentage is contractual versus spot. John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: So we don't give kind of percentages of contracts versus public by individual business segment. But we are focused, again, on our value proposition. We're focused on the demand, the strong demand that's going on in that marketplace and we are pricing it appropriately. If you look at that marketplace, there's huge new production coming online, of sand facilities in Wisconsin and Minnesota. We're excited about our franchise and the ability that we're giving the disproportionate amount of that new production on our line, which we think is a great opportunity for us in the future. So we think that as long as the drilling continues and oil prices sustain drilling, we have nice growth opportunity ahead of us in the future. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, perfect. And then you mentioned earlier your longer term view of a resurgence in industrial activity in the U.S. Within that context, how are you thinking about the new ethane crackers coming online, maybe in terms of the size of the opportunity? And has there been any talk from customers about potential delays from either labor or the recent slide in crude prices? Eric L. Butler: Yes, as you know, Allison, that there's huge number of new capacity coming online. A lot of that will come online in '16 or '17. Those were the plans. But as long as natural gas kind of remains where it is, in the $3.75 range, it's going to be a huge financial incentive for those projects to go forward. There's been public reports of some spot shortages of skilled laborers. As far as we could tell, it's not significant or material to the timetable of any of those projects. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Wanted to follow up on that question about comparing this to that '04, '05 timeframe. If I go back and look, when you guys were having those significant service issues, it really kicked off a 3- or 4-year period of pretty material share losses to be in. This year we're seeing the opposite. Do you think this is the beginning of a multiyear period of share gain or do you think this is going to be more of just a one-off? John J. Koraleski: That's really hard for us to tell right now, Scott. So I got to tell you, the BNSF is a great railroad. And they're going to come back, and they're going to come back strong. So we have seen some opportunities, probably the strongest we've seen have been in grain and in Intermodal, but those can move back very quickly. And our goal is to impress those customers with our value proposition and doing business with Union Pacific such that when the competition is stronger than what they are today, they won't think about shifting back. But it is a tough competitive marketplace out there and we recognize we will have to compete. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Are the tenor of the conversations suggesting that next year could be another year of share gain or could some of that go back in your mind? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: As Jack said, the BNSF is a tough competitor. I think they have publicly stated in different forums that next year, the full year, will be a full recovery year for them. We see them working hard to recover and I would not be surprised to see them recovering in different parts of their markets as you go through the year and they will continue to be a strong competitor. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, that makes sense. And then one for you Rob. If I look back at last year when you had legacy pricing, it looked like it was about 1 point, 1.5 point boost to the core pricing gains. Is it realistic to think next year could be similar to that? And is there any update on what percent of the legacy you expect to retain? Sometimes you can give us an update around that. Robert M. Knight: Yes. I mean, just to kind of reiterate what I think you already know Scott. You're right, we achieved about 1.5 point of benefit last year from legacy contract renewals. Coming into this year, we said \"legacy light.\" So basically 0 this year. Next year, we have about $300 million worth of revenue that we will compete for in the marketplace. We don't give guidance in terms of what the pricing's going to look like on that. But we're going to be in the marketplace competing and we're in those discussions as we speak. So no further update on that, other than it will -- we would expect there would be some contributor next year on legacy versus this year, 0. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just have one question here on Intermodal. We mentioned the BNSF issues and there was obviously some labor volatility. A few of the other railroads are talking about the potential that shippers will start to diversify away from the port of L.A., Long Beach. And I see you have a question mark on your Intermodal growth outlook. Do you think that this diversification is possible and to what extent it might impact your operation out of those ports? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: So, Walter, great question. The market is aware and we are aware of the difficulties that are occurring right now in the Port of L.A., Long Beach. They are experiencing backups. A variety of reasons for that. Probably some of it is due to some of the labor uncertainty with the West Coast ILWU workers. Some of it's probably related to the fact that you have larger ships going into the terminals and they're dwelling longer as they're trying to unload those ships. Part of it is due to the fact that as the alliances, the steamship alliances, are changing. It's having different impacts on different terminals within the Port of L.A. and Port of Long Beach. So a variety of issues. Those issues, frankly, are impacting some of our transportation operations. We're doing some things creatively to overcome those. But if you look at it, the Port of L.A., Long Beach is still such a huge driver of West Coast imports. It's unlikely to see significant long-term material diversions. Last month, September, the Port of L.A., Long Beach, hit volume levels that they hadn't seen since probably '06 or '07. So they're seeing huge volume growth. There might be some nominal diversions to some other ports, whether up or down the U.S. West Coast or in Canada. Some of those ports have similar capacity challenges that they also have, that they're also working through. So there might be some nominal short-term diversions. But long term, if the Port of L.A., Long Beach can get their issues worked through, they're still in a pretty good place to maintain and grow their segment of the business. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And as you see some of that capacity tightening along the Western U.S. and Canada, as we approach a more full -- approach Panama fully up and running, as time gets closer, are you hearing your shippers talk more and more, looking harder at what they're going to do with Panama? I know there's still a lot of question marks around the rates around there and all that, but any update on what the potential impact, longer-term, of Panama could be? Eric L. Butler: Yes, so, as you know, there's still a whole rate question out there in terms of if it's going to cost more money and you have a longer transit time. There is actually a construction delay question still out there with the Panama Canal. I think what we've said in the past is still what we think today, that you might have 1% or 2% that gets diverted today. About 30% of the business is all water. That might grow to 31%, 32%. But we don't see, nor are we hearing from shippers, anything significant beyond that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : With regard to the -- you guys have historically talked that the train size performance isn't kind of the end-all be-all, particularly when there are growth opportunities. I think we saw that with the Intermodal results this quarter. Could you give us a sense how much more volume the Intermodal network could handle on average, if volumes continue to pick up here? John J. Koraleski: Sure. Lance? Lance M. Fritz: Yes. Rob, so you're right. Train size is not the be-all end-all. Intermodal was impacted this quarter by new products that, on average, were smaller than the rest of the network. And if you think about train size opportunity on Intermodal trains as it exists today, to get them up to average train size in the routes that they go, there's plenty of upside. Not putting it in a percentage, but dozens and dozens of boxes. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : That's helpful. And then, Lance, as I'm thinking about the Intermodal growth, particularly on the expedite trailer side, you guys have clearly taken market share in the PNW down to Chicago. How much of the growth has been driven by some large customers you guys took on there versus just overall network gains that you're seeing across the network due to a tight trucking marketplace? Lance M. Fritz: It's probably more a question for Eric. But I will tell you, we do not speak to specific customers. We do have a new product in that lane that's performing well and it is attracting new business. Eric L. Butler: Yes, that's the answer. And I mentioned that earlier, we put in some new products both to the PNW and to California. And those new products are attracting business, particularly as some of our competitors are struggling in that corridor. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And, Eric, as we think about that business, should there be a significant peaking factor to the RPU in the fourth quarter associated with that or is the third quarter a pretty good run rate looking out kind of for the Intermodal product? John J. Koraleski: I think overall, Rob, we're not going to give specific pricing guidance on that. I think we'll have to just wait and see how the business materializes and hopefully it's going to continue to be positive. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I had a question with regards to Mexico. It's been sort of around 10% of your revenue days. And I'm wondering, is that changing materially? And if not, when do you anticipate the growth or potential outsized growth in Mexico to start to contribute or a little bit more of the overall book of revenue. John J. Koraleski: Overall, Thomas, it was 10% again in the quarter. Volume was up about 9%, so it's a great piece of business with us. In terms of future growth, Eric, you want to take a shot? Eric L. Butler: We continue to think Mexico has nice future growth opportunities on the auto side, the grain side, the industrial product side. A 9% growth trend is pretty good. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'm curious as to what the point when -- one would think, with all the newer sourcing opportunity, that it should be a bigger percentage of the book to business. And I guess if you can maybe frame out, maybe even how Santa Teresa fits into that picture and when you anticipate that potentially adding maybe 1 point or 0.5 point in terms of the overall revenue contribution. Will you be able to frame out perhaps maybe the medium- to long-term? Robert M. Knight: This is Rob, maybe I can answer that for you that Thomas. I mean we're not going to give specific guidance on that. But I would just say that if look out over the last several years, our volumes in and out of Mexico -- and of course as you know, we're the only railroad that crosses the 6 rail crossing points. But our Mexican-related business has been growing faster than our overall enterprise business has. So it's been contributing. And we're not going to break out in terms of what the margins are on that business. But I would just tell you that it's good business that we're bringing on the network. So it has been contributing and continues to contribute as we move forward. Eric L. Butler: And your Santa Teresa growth is meeting expectations. And just as a data point, that would be considered domestic business. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. All right, great. Can I just ask a question with regard to the labor inflation? Obviously we're hearing sort of recurring, sort of comments about the challenges recruiting labor and obviously -- just in particular, with regards to certain markets where labor's extremely tight. Should we be a little concerned? Is wage inflation possibly a headwind into 2015 that we should be thinking about or are there other mitigating factors that could dampen that sort of concern that we might be having here? John J. Koraleski: You know, we have a solid pipeline of talent. We have a great organization out getting us new employees. And right now, we're not seeing a concern. Rob, do you have any insight on inflationary [indiscernible]? Robert M. Knight: Yes, Thomas. I would just say that's all wrapped in to -- I agree with Jack's comments. In the inflation, we expect it to be higher next year. And as I said earlier 3 plus-ish versus the less than 2 all in this year. For lots of reasons. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I wanted to follow up on how you're thinking about the potential pricing environment in Intermodal. Do you think it should mirror some of the contractual rate increases we're seeing in the truckload market? Or given you've been pushing price in this business to get back to re-investable levels over the past few years, do you think the pace of increases could be below what we're seeing in truckload? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: Again, we feel very good about our value proposition. And as the truck market tightens from a variety of issues, the new CSA rules, truck driver, the cost of fuel, the cost of cabs, we think that just strengthens our value proposition and strengthens our ability to get price as we go into the future. Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And another one on Intermodal. It's obviously a lower RPU business, but is there any way you could speak to the incremental margins that you're seeing in Intermodal today? Just given the opportunity to build into the -- add the train lengths, et cetera. Do the incremental margins in Intermodal look pretty similar to your other commodity groups? Robert M. Knight: This is Rob, let me answer that. We don't break out specific margin by business. But you have heard me, perhaps, say many times, that our Intermodal opportunities -- Intermodal has typically been on the lower end, if you will, of our very diverse business group and it's been moving up fast. All of our business has been moving in the right direction. And as Eric said, we still have confidence that we can continue to move it directionally correct. Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. But to clarify, today it's still a bit below the other businesses? Robert M. Knight: It's probably below average, but improving nicely. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research : Two follow-ups on previously asked questions. The one just before me on pricing and Intermodal : could you please help us understand the outlook for continued sustained improvement? And maybe the main drivers, whether it's narrowing the gap to trucking, given your enhanced value proposition, whether changes in the road mix or the mix of domestic versus Intermodal, new relationships that you are building. Please help us understand what we should look for, long-term, for Intermodal pricing. John J. Koraleski: You know, Cleo, you did a pretty good job of answering that question. I think it's a combination of all those things. It's, first of all, getting our service back into the zone where it absolutely needs to be and we're committed and we'll get there. So that's a good thing for us. Secondly, it is the relationships, the new business opportunities. Thirdly, it's when you look at the business proposition that Intermodal offers compared to the trucking industry, the opportunity for highway conversion, when you think about environmental friendliness, when you think about the fuel efficiency, when you think about the whole package of the beauty of Intermodal, which combines the best of both truck and rail. That's an opportunity for us. You add to that the capital investments that we're making in places like Santa Teresa, that's part of our opportunity pipeline. So all of those things that you've identified continue to keep us excited about the growth opportunity. And then the other thing that I would add is the pressure on the trucking industry, the additional regulations they're seeing the increased insurance cost. And eventually, you're going to find out that they're going end up with driver shortages. We're back now to where the housing market's getting back into what would be considered normal. What we saw originally was all those guys that went out of construction went into driving trucks. And right now they want to stay home with their kids. They're all shifting back into the construction zone. So I would expect that, at some point in time, the trucking industry is going to have driver shortage issues. All that plays into our book. Anybody want to add? Unknown Executive : No, good. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research : And the second question also goes back to the issue of capacity. Can you please help us understand why just looking at the past peaks in terms of carloads on your network may not fully reflect your new capacity and flexibility. I don't know if it's just because the cars themselves are getting bigger or there are changes with your manifest versus unit train mix. Any other change in the base of your resources that really enable you to support growth more than we appreciate right now. John J. Koraleski: Okay, Lance? Lance M. Fritz: Sure, yes. Actually, Cleo, if you go back to the same volume levels, historically we're running about 1.5 mile to maybe even 2 miles an hour faster than we were at equivalent volume levels. That's a direct reflection of improved network capacity. And so when we look forward, our current utilization of that network capacity is not what we want it to be, we're retarded by lack of crews and a handful of other things. As we get on top of that, moving forward, which we are doing, we anticipate that those service levels improve at these current volume levels and give us plenty of runway for future growth. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research : How about maybe infrastructure investments by your customers, whether it's Energy or Chemicals. Do those also help you carry more growth with the relatively efficient use of resources on your end? Lance M. Fritz: Absolutely they do, Cleo. And our customers are making significant investment to support themselves in the marketplace and help us serve them better all the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of MorningStar. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : I'd like to return to the strong frac sand growth you mentioned and its divergence from the quarter's crude volume trends. Could you share some color on broad customer behavior? For example, what portion of sand shifts to wet versus dry wells. And are you seeing changes in driller behavior, such as more sand per well? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: So the second question, more sand per well. Absolutely. There's a lot of technology changes that's allowing the drilling services industry to do longer laterals, more laterals, and that has been a driver of our sand growth all year long. And we've talked about that in the past, we'll continue to talk about that in the future. In terms of where the sand is going to, I think it's really being driven by the economics of the well. Today, you see lots of drilling in the Permian Basin, lots of drilling in the Eagle Ford. You see growing drilling in the Niobrara. You see the Marcellus kind of resuming the levels of drilling that they had a couple of years ago. And you see sand flowing to all of those places. It's really driven by the economics of the shale play. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : A significant portion of it is going to dry gas. Is that correct here? Eric L. Butler: If you look at where the sand is flowing today, I think the shales that I just listed are the common places where the sand is flowing today. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. The capacity improvements you've outlined, which is the biggest, earliest lever to improve congestion. Is it mode of power, employees or infrastructure? I suspect you'll say all of the above. Is it crew the biggest constraint? John J. Koraleski: I wouldn't say all of the above. First thing we're focused on is crews. There are other constraints but crews is the primary one right now. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Trey [ph] with Nomura. Unknown Analyst : I had a question. Given the systemic issues in truckload and driver shortage which, by all appearances, look like it's going to be a multi-year thing. Is this an opportunity to examine your marketing strategy with Intermodal internally and potentially your usage of IMCs? I was just wondering if you're thinking about that. John J. Koraleski: Matt, we evaluate our marketing strategy constantly. And up until this point in time, we continue to see IMCs as our primary carrier in the marketplace. We think that model is solid and we are working very hard to work together with our IMC customers to improve service and to help them succeed in their marketplace. I don't know, Eric, do you have anything to add to that? Okay. Unknown Analyst : I guess, as a follow-up, short haul versus long haul. Traditionally we've kind of thought of about a 10% to 15% spread versus truck. And in short haul, Intermodal, 40%, 50% north in long haul. Is that relationship still true? Are those numbers accurate? Have they narrowed? And if not, is there an opportunity to narrow them given the issues in truckload? John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: Yes. I think what we've said is that the spread actually kind of depends on lanes and it could range from 35%, 40% spread, which is large, so as narrow as a 10% or 15% spread. And we think, with our value proposition, we'll continue to be able to narrow that spread and price closer and closer to truck as we improve our service and value propositions. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just to follow on that final point, in terms of the IMC partners. How do you think about the strategy going forward? The trend over the past 10 years, it seems, has been fewer number of IMCs as opposed to more. I'm just wondering how you think about that going forward, given the fact that you do think that, that strategy is a healthy and viable one. Would you prefer to see a continued reduction in the number of IMC partners and really focus on scale and throughput and productivity to solve some of the constraints and to pursue market growth in Domestic Intermodal? Would you prefer more to help alleviate or kind of continue to strengthen your bargaining power? I'm just trying to think about that strategy over the next 5 years with regard to IMCs. John J. Koraleski: Eric? Eric L. Butler: Yes, Ben. One of the things we realize is that it is a big, wide, broad market out there and you have lots of different customers, and customers opportunities. You have large customers, the large retailers that probably will be managed with a small set of large IMCs. But you have a large group of midsize and smaller customers that we believe, at least at this time, that you'll continue to have a broad base of smaller IMCs that will assist in servicing and addressing those channels. And that's the reason for the strategy that Jack talked about, where we continue to see the IMCs being a large portion of our go-to-market strategy. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments. John J. Koraleski: Great. Thanks, Rob, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I was going to say we look forward to speaking with you in January, but hopefully we'll see you November 5 in Chicago at our meeting. And if not, again, we'll see you when we wrap up the year in January. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. John Koraleski : Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today here in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning we\u2019re pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved fourth quarter earnings of $1.61 per share, an increase of 27% compared to the fourth quarter 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 6% with increases in all six of our business groups. Industrial products and coal showed particular strength up 10% and 9% respectively.  These strong volumes along with solid core pricing and productivity helped drive 3.6 points of improvement on our operating ratio to a record 61.4% for the fourth quarter. These strong fourth quarter results rounded out a full year 2014 which was very successful on many fronts. We posted record financial results in revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and operating ratio. The strong demand we experienced back in the first quarter was sustained throughout 2014 driving total volume growth of 7% for the year.  Robust volumes challenged our network for much of the year and we remain focused on adding the necessary resources to safely improve service and we\u2019re encouraged with the progress that we\u2019re making. We remain fully committed to delivery safe, efficient, value added service for our customers. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Eric. Eric Butler : In the fourth quarter volume was up 6% as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in all of our business groups. Strength in industrial products and goal led our volume gain for the quarter and intermodal and chemicals volumes were strong as well. Growth moderated in ag products during the quarter as we are now comparing to the strong grain harvest in 2013. Core price increased 3% which drove average revenue per car up by 3% in the quarter. Our volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 9% which set a fourth quarter record of $5.8 billion. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was up 9% in the fourth quarter on a 4% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. [Indiscernible] car loads were up 3% in the fourth quarter reflecting another record crop year for both corn and soybeans. US corn production was up more than 3% and soybean production was up 18% over the 2013 crops. We saw strong overseas export feed grain shipments this quarter, partially offset by lower exports to Mexico as receivers switched to local supply. Domestic feed grain shipments also contributed to our growth as lower corn prices drove demand. Wheat car loadings continued to be a headwind as lower wheat prices drove down export shipments. Grain products volume grew by 4% as strong gasoline demand and favorable export conditions drove another strong quarter of S&L shipments.  Food and refrigerated shipments were up 4% for the quarter. There was a strong domestic sugar beet crop which combined continued import beer growth to more than offset softer fresh and frozen food shipments. Automotive revenue was flat in the fourth quarter on a 2% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 2% driven by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem shipments and also by mix. As a reminder, we lapsed the per diem change at the end of 2014 so we will not have this impact going forward. Finished vehicle shipments were up 2% this quarter driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 16.7 million vehicles for the fourth quarter up more than one million units from the same quarter in 2013. Partially offsetting our volume gains was production variability at some key plants. On the parts side, increased production and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 2% volume increase.  In chemicals, our revenue was 8% for the quarter on a 5% volume increase and a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Fertilizer shipments were up 17% in the fourth quarter driven primarily by strong international demand for pot ash and shipments of phos rock. Crude oil volume was up 7% in the quarter. We saw gains in shipments from the Niobrara and Uinta Basins which more than offset continued weakness in Bakken shipments caused by unfavorable price spreads. Finally, liquid petroleum gas storage shipments along with fuel additives and lube oil demand, drove our petroleum and LPG shipments up 5% for the quarter. Coal revenue increased 9% on a 9% increase in volume and a 15 increase in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was up 17% for the quarter. You will recall that we had an easy comp due to a snow storm that impacted shipments out of the Southern Powder River Basin in October 2013. In addition, strong demand from lower inventories and stock powder replenishment ahead of winter attributed to our growth and offset volume headwinds from our previously reported legacy contract loss. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 11% for the quarter driven primarily by continued soft demand for export coal.  Industrial products revenue increased 15% on a 10% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. Non-metallic minerals were up 28% for the quarter again, primarily driven by a 35% increase in frac sand shipments. We continue to see demand for construction product shipments where volume was up 17% based on demand for aggregates and cement. Lumber shipments were up 10% in the quarter driven by housing and non-residential construction [indiscernible] over-the-road truck to rail conversions. Finally, in intermodal, revenue was up 11% driven by 6% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit. We had another strong quarter in domestic intermodal with volume up 10%. New premium services and highway conversions continue to drive and led to a best ever fourth quarter in domestic intermodal. Our international intermodal volume was up 2% as new business volume and continued economic strength in the US offset headwinds created by reduced west coast port productivity. Let\u2019s take a look at how we see our business shaping up for 2015. In ag products the strong corn and soybean crop and competitive corn prices should sustain domestic demand while worldwide grain inventories are relatively high creating a potential headwind for exports. Ethanol margins are tightening which can lead to a reduction in ethanol production in the near term. Longer term increased gasoline consumption and export opportunities should create strength in the ethanol market and demand for DPG should strengthen as China reenters the market.  We also anticipated another strong year of import beer growth. In automotive finished vehicles and auto parts shipments will continue to benefit from strength in production and sales driven by an improving US economy, replacement demand, and lower gasoline prices. Low inventory levels should continue to drive replenishment demand for coal into 2015. We\u2019re watching natural gas prices closely but at this point we have not seen lower prices impact demand for coal. We expect most of our chemicals market to remain solid in 2015 but we think crude oil will be a headwind throughout the year. We will keep a close eye on oil prices as the year progresses as the recent drop has led producers to reevaluate their plans for 2015. Ultimately, if oil prices remain at current levels it will impact our crude oil shipments.  We also expect energy markets to be a factor in our frac sand volumes and industrial products. The decline in oil prices has impacted rig counts so it is unlikely that we will see the robust levels of growth that we saw in 2014. However, our franchise is well positioned to participate in ongoing fracing operations. We\u2019ll have to see how the energy markets play out to see what the ultimate impact will be on our sand volumes. Also, in industrial products we expect the marketing construction products to continue particularly in the southern part of our franchise. We also anticipate year-over-year improvement in housing and other construction markets to drive demand for lumber. In intermodal consumer demand and highway conversions will drive growth in domestic intermodal in 2015. In international intermodal we would expect increased imports to drive growth this year however, the deterioration of productivity at west coast ports is having an impact on our volume early in the first quarter. At this point while we are hopeful that the parties will come to a resolution soon, international intermodal will be a headwind until the labor dispute is resolved. To wrap up, there are a number of uncertainties on the horizon. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on the impact of crude oil prices, softening global economies, and the west coast labor dispute. Overall, we expect the US economy to continue to strengthen this year and drive growth in many of our business groups. With our diverse franchise, strong value proposition and continued focus on business development, we expect to deliver another year of positive volume and profitable revenue growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Lance. Lance Fritz : I\u2019ll start with safety where our full year results included a record low reportable personal injury rate of 0.98, an 11% improvement versus 2013. I\u2019m very proud of the team as we made a nice step forward on our commitment that every employee returns home safely after each shift. In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 7% to 3.00 falling just short of an all-time record. Enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold, to a record low. In public safety our grade crossing incident rate increased 5% versus 2013. Driver behavior continues to be a critical factor in crossing incidents. We continued to reinforce public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns, and focused our counter measures on high risk crossings. In summary, the team has made terrific progress on our goal of achieving annual safety records on the way to an incident free environment. In regards to network performance we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust volume growth we enjoyed. During the latter part of the fourth quarter our available resources were largely aligned with demand. That, combined with a successful Thanksgiving holiday operation and better winter action plans, contributed to substantial service improvement in December. The net result was sequential velocity improvement in each region of our network, all while handling strong volumes. While our velocity in December was more than a mile an hour faster in November, and the best since January, our service performance still fell short during the fourth quarter. As reported to the AAR, fourth quarter velocity was down 8% and freight car dwell up 11% when compared to 2013. Our performance in December was a step in the right direction, but we are still not where we need to be. The team continues its relentless push to handle our customer\u2019s growing volumes while improving service. Moving to productivity, volume trends from the first nine months of 2014 largely continued in the fourth quarter including relatively balanced growth in each region. We continued to leverage volume by increasing train lengths. During the fourth quarter we set best ever records in nearly all major categories. The exception was in intermodal where new service offerings created a headwinds. Even so, we still generated a year-over-year increase in part reflecting our success in growing volumes within these lanes and our fuel conservation initiatives generated positive results in 2014 including a 2% improvement in the fourth quarter. We found new opportunities to reduce waste and continued to deploy advanced technologies that assist the engineer in saving fuel and that optimize train [needs]. With the workforce and locomotives resourced to match demand, we are positioned to generate both productivity gains and improved network fluidity. Last year, our total TE&Y workforce increased by more than 1,700 employees and our active locomotive fleet increased by around 800 units. Surge resources activated during the year accounted for some of the TE&Y and most of the locomotive growth. In addition to recalls, we hired around 3,600 TE&Y employees in 2014. Approximately 1,000 of these new hires moved from training to active status during the last three months of the year. For 2015, we plan to hire 2,800 TE&Y employees to cover growth and attrition and to generate incremental service improvement. We also plan to acquire 218 locomotives on top of the 261 units we purchased in 2014.  As 2015 unfolds, we will adjust resources based on demand and network performance. Rebuilding our surge resources is an important part of our operating strategy. Capital investment in our track infrastructure has also helped us handle volume growth while maintaining a safe and resilient network. In total, we invested just under $4.1 billion in our 2014 capital program. This includes $2.3 billion in replacement capital to harden our infrastructure and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. At the end of the year, roughly 99% of our track miles were free of [indiscernible]. Spending for service, growth, and productivity totaled $1.4 billion driven by investments in capacity, commercial facilities, and equipment. Major growth investments included the completion of our Santa Teresa New Mexico facility as well as the Tower 55 project in Fort Worth Texas, both alleviated key bottlenecks. We also invested $385 million in positive train control during 2014, bringing our cumulative PTC investment to $1.6 billion of the roughly $2 billion projected spend.  Assuming moderate economic growth, our overall 2015 capital plan will likely be higher than last year\u2019s spending. New capacity investments will continue in the eastern third of our network and we will advance quarter strategies and reduce bottlenecks across the system. Our core investment thesis will not waiver, which is to maintain a safe, strong, reliable network and to invest in service, growth, and productivity projects that meet our aggressive return thresholds.  To wrap up, as we start 2015 our investment strategy is to continue to move our service volume frontier up and to the right. As a result, we expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident free environment. We expect to create opportunities through improved network performance, and to continue working with connecting railroads on key gateway interchange performance, and we\u2019ll invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and to handle increased demand. Leveraging volume growth and productivity gains to drive incremental operating ratio improvement. We will remain agile adapting and adjusting resources according to network performance and demand.  In fact, we\u2019ve already started to rebuild our surge plate moving around 100 older less efficient locomotives into storage and 400 or so employees into furlough or alternative work status. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob. Robert Knight : Let\u2019s start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 9% to nearly $6.2 billion driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.8 billion, increasing 3% over last year. The net result was operating income growing 20% to about $2.4 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $71 million up from $37 million in 2013. Included in the $71 million was approximately $0.02 per share of onetime items including real estate gains. Interest expense of $146 million was up 15% compared to the previous year, primarily driven by increased debt issuance during the year. Income tax expense increased to $867 million driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 22% versus 2013 while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best ever quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share, up 27% versus last year.  Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 9% to nearly $5.8 billion. This is driven primarily by volume growth of 6% and core pricing gains of 3%. Fuel surcharge revenue was about flat for the fourth quarter as the decline in fuel price was offset by the lag in fuel surcharge program and higher volumes. All in, we estimate the net impact of the reduced fuel prices add $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus last year. This includes both the surcharge lag and the lower diesel costs. Business mix was also about flat for the quarter as the positive mix impact from frac sand volume was offset by the increase in lower average revenue per unit intermodal shipments during the quarter. Other revenue increased 8% in the quarter. Primary drivers included revenue associated with the per diem on auto parts containers as well as subsidiary related volume growth. Recall that last January we began reporting per diem revenue on auto parts containers in other revenue as a result of a change in how we are compensated for this service, and as Eric just mentioned we\u2019ve now lapped that change on a year-over-year basis so we won\u2019t see a variance from the per diem going forward. Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. Fourth quarter core pricing came in at 3% reflecting steady improvement throughout the year and a more favorable pricing environment. For the full year, core pricing was around 2.5% demonstrating our commitment to market pricing at reinvestable levels above inflation. While 2014 was a legacy light year, we do expect to see some benefit in 2015 for legacy renewals and I\u2019m pleased to announce we have successfully retained 100% of the legacy business that was up for renewal beginning in 2015. In addition, we have also successfully renegotiated a year early, the legacy business that was due to expire in 2016. With the exception of only a few small contracts in the out years, we have now successfully addressed all of our remaining legacy contracts. Moving onto the expense side, Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefit expense which increased 7% versus 2013. Higher volumes, inflation, and increased training expense were the primary drivers of the increase along with some increased cost associated with running a less than optimal network.  Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4.5% when compared to 2013. At this point in time we plan to hire around 5,700 employees in 2015 to cover attrition of just under 4,000 as well as for volume growth and capital programs. As Lance just discussed, the bulk of this hiring will come in our TE&Y ranks. Labor inflation for 2015 is expected to come in between 4% and 5% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation.  Turning to the next Slide, fuel expense totaled $813 million down 10% when compared to 2013. A 7% increase in gross ton miles was more than offset by lower diesel fuel prices in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% while our average fuel price declined 14% to $2.66 per gallon.  Moving onto our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 14% to $665 million due to volume related contract and subsidiary expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs, and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $489 million up 7% compared to 2013 and in line with our 7% to 8% full year guidance. In 2015 depreciation expense is expected to increase between 4% to 6% for the full year.  Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $296 million which is 5% favorable when compared to 2013. The favorability was primarily attributable to lower lease cost as a result of exercising purchase options on some of our leased equipment. Other expenses came in at $228 million up $40 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, personal injury expense, and damaged freight and equipment costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. Other expenses finished the year up 9% within the range of our full year guidance of 5% to 10%. For 2015 we expect the other expense line to again increase between 5% and 10% on a full year basis excluding any unusual items.  Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 61.4% improving 3.6 points when compared to 2013. The net impact of lower fuel prices contributed about 1.5 points of the improvement. I am also pleased to report a full year operating ratio of 63.5% which is 2.6 points improvement from 2013. As you will recall from our investor day event this past November, we have issued new operating ratio guidance of a 60% operating ratio plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019.  Slide 28 provides a full summary of our 2014 earnings and a full year income statement. I\u2019ll walk through a few highlights from our record setting year. Operating revenue grew more than $2 billion to $24 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.8 billion topping 2013 by 18% and net income was just under $5.2 billion while earnings grew 22% to $5.75 per share.  Turning now to our cash flow, in 2014 cash from operations increased to almost $7.4 billion, up 8% compared to 2013. After dividends our free cash flow totaled $1.5 billion for the year. This is down $581 million from 2013 reflecting primarily higher cash capital and dividend payments along with the headwind of bonus depreciation. Taking a closer look at 2015, we will see the benefit of 2014 bonus depreciation which was passed just before year end. This benefit will nearly offset the cash tax payments associated with prior year programs. As a result, the net impact of bonus depreciation on this year\u2019s cash flow will be close to neutral.  Slide 30 shows our 2014 capital program of just under $4.1 billion. In 2015 we expect to increase our capital plans somewhat from \u201814s levels to approximately $4.3 billion pending final approval from our board of directors in February. The chart on the right shows our improvement in generating returns on these investments over the last several years. Return on invested capital was 16.2% in 2014 up 1.5 points from 2013. Of course, as we\u2019ve said many times, if you calculate it on a replacement basis, our returns would be significantly lower. In addition to funding our capital program our record profitability and strong cash generation enabled us to also significantly grow shareholder returns. We increased our quarterly dividend per share twice in 2014 to $0.50 per share by the fourth quarter, up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2013. For 2014 we achieved a declared payout ratio of just above 33% up from 31.5% in 2013 and consistent with our new guidance of growing dividend payout target to 35%.  We also continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases. In the fourth quarter we bought back more than 7.7 million shares totaling $880 million. For the full year purchases exceeded 32 million shares and totaled about $3.2 billion, up 45% from 2013. Our current repurchase authorization of up to $120 million shares over a four year time period went into effect January 1, 2014. About 88 million shares remain on that authorization as of yearend 2014. When you combine dividend payments and share repurchases we returned almost $4.9 billion to our shareholders in 2014. These combined payments represented a 37% increase over 2013 continuing our strong commitment to increasing shareholder value.  Taking a look at the balance sheet we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $2.1 billion in 2014 bringing our adjusted debt balance to $14.9 billion at year end. This increases our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 41.3% up from 37.6% at yearend 2013. This puts us in line with our guidance of an adjusted debt to cap ratio in the low to mid 40% range. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 and remain committed to our longer term guidance of an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus.  That\u2019s a recap of the fourth quarter and full year results. As we look ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to achieve yet another record year in many of our key financial measures. Solid core pricing, ongoing productivity initiatives, and volume leverage opportunities assuming the economy cooperates, should help drive continued margin improvement. As Eric highlighted earlier, we have growth opportunities across a variety of market sectors that should drive modest volume growth for the first quarter and the full year.  We\u2019ll continue to focus on improving returns and generating strong cash flow which will support our ongoing capital investments as well as our commitment to increasing returns to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jack. John Koraleski : As you\u2019d expect with 2014 behind us, we\u2019re intently focused on the year ahead. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s looking like. Overall, the US economy continues to move forward at a moderate pace but of course, there\u2019s always some uncertainty out there. Clearly, one of the biggest uncertainties is the outlook for energy markets which will bring both challenges and opportunities as we move ahead. Lower energy prices could slow the recent [shale] related domestic energy boom depending on how low the prices get and how long they stay there. On the other hand, lower gasoline prices could spur continued auto sales and help strengthen the consumer economy which would create opportunities in our other market segments. On balance, with all the pluses and minuses taken together we expect to see positive volume growth for the 2015 year. We\u2019ll watch closely and stay agile so that we can meet our customer\u2019s needs across our diverse franchise. We\u2019ll also continue to build on the progress we\u2019ve made in improving our network capability so that we can provide the safe reliable service our customers expect and deserve. We\u2019re entering the year well-resourced and we\u2019re looking forward to safely providing efficient value added service for our customers and increasing returns for our shareholders in 2015. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Q - Allison Landry : Thinking about frac sand in 2015 and the number of wells drilled is expected to be down somewhere in the 25% range and sort of offsetting that would be the better capitalized E&P companies high grading and improving productivity per well, if you sort of balance these factors do you think you can still grow frac sand carloads year-over-year? What scenario do you think volumes would outright contract? Eric Butler : I think you have it exactly right where there are ins and outs in terms of there have already been reported probably about 20% rig reduction but the well capitalized companies are focused on continuing to drill where they could make their profit and there\u2019s a wide range of economics in all of the shales, so thinking of all those factors. Having said that, I think it really is too early to tell how all of that is going to play out. We certainly don\u2019t know if oil prices will remain this low. If oil prices increase certainly, that\u2019s going to be a lift for us so there are a lot of ins and outs.  We feel really, really good that we have the premier franchise in terms of kind of frac sand coverage. We have the best franchise for most of the major shales, particularly the shales that will arguably still be profitable the Eagle Ford, Permian, you can see growth in the Niobrara. There\u2019s even rumblings about the Haynesville coming back. We feel really, really good about our franchise and our position and at this point we, like everybody else, is keeping a close eye on it. Allison Landry : Just as a follow up question, Jack some of your comments at the end I think, in terms of thinking about the broader economic benefit of lower oil prices sort of against the backdrop of weakness and shale related activity, how do we think about this in terms of overall volume growth? Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes but are you thinking about it sort of as like a net-net neutral sort of on a relative basis with benefits maybe in autos, consumer products, etc. and then that being offset by crude by rail, frac? Could you help us think about that? John Koraleski : I think your heads in the right place on that. I think when you look at it, I think popular opinion says consumer drives two thirds of the economy. If consumers are having discretionary spending and they\u2019re going to buy automobiles, they\u2019re going to build houses, they\u2019re going to buy new furniture, consumer goods, those kinds of things, those kind of all hit right within the sweet spot of our franchise and we\u2019ve seen that in the fourth quarter, the construction products up 17%, lumber up 10%, automobile business the SAR at 16.7% so it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that knocking on the door of $17 million for 2015.  Again, when we add it all up pluses and minuses, we think at the end of the year barring anything that is unusual that we haven\u2019t seen at this point in time, we\u2019re going to still end up with positive volume by the time we get to the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Exeter [ph] - Bank of America. Ken Exeter [ph]: Rob, when you set the operating ratio target fuel was much higher and you noted a 1.5 point benefit. Are there any other offsets that don\u2019t get you to move up that timeframe? I guess if you think about the 1.5 point benefit from the 63.5 along with the repricing that\u2019s already locked in what can happen in terms of - is there a chance you hit that target in 2015 or is there something there that can offset that? A - Robert Knight : Clearly, this unprecedented fall off in fuel helped us and clearly, if it stayed at this level or dropped even further that would be a contributor towards achieving our targeted 60 plus or minus operating ratio target. But you know, we\u2019ll see how fuel plays out. I\u2019m not willing to bet that over the long haul fuel will stay where it is and the rest of the story if you will in terms of us running a safe efficient railroad getting core pricing, squeezing out productivity so I think what the drivers are really going to get back to is our core fundamentals in the business that will enable us to get to that sub 60 as soon as we possibly can. John Koraleski : Ken said that 1.5 points came from fuel, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite right is it? Robert Knight : Just to clarify that because I\u2019m not sure I did catch exactly how you asked it, but just to clarify the impact of fuel, the benefit of the failing fuel price in the fourth quarter was about 1.5 points of benefit in the fourth quarter. For the full year the benefit of the fuel was more like .7 of a helper on our operating ratio. Ken Exeter [ph]: I was extrapolating that fourth quarter benefit through the year if we stayed at these lower prices. If I could just get a follow up. Eric, you mentioned low nat gas prices can impact, there\u2019s a lag before it impacts coal flows, can you maybe delve into that a little bit? Talk about maybe the outlook for coal, do we see one more quarter of replenishing stock piles and then starting in the second quarter we see a fall off with these prices or is it still kind of in that flux point even at these levels? In terms of PRB switching it seems like it\u2019s already impacted the Colorado Utah side? Maybe you can delve into that a little bit? Eric Butler : We\u2019ve historically said and I think the market convention was kind of the switch over point was below the mid twos for natural gas pricing. The Colorado Utah impact was really an export coal world coal price impact, it\u2019s not a domestic US natural gas impact. As we look forward we\u2019re not really seeing a lot of switch over impact for us now. We are still seeing replenishment. As you suggested the inventory numbers for December should come out here in the next couple of days, we still expect that inventories are going to be low when they come out here in the next couple of days but the other - we\u2019ve said forever, the real driver is weather and the economy and so that will be the ultimate driver for our coal volumes.  We do feel really good about where we stand from a position - one of the strategic factors that I think may have changed from the past is that if you go a year ago and what happened with natural gas prices there was a lot of volatility and I think there\u2019s been rethinking on many of the utilities to really think coal as a base line fuel as a risk hedge against the natural gas volatility. For that reason I feel pretty good about our coal outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Long - Stephens, Inc. Justin Long : I wanted to ask a question about intermodal. I know this varies by lane, but when you look at the price differential between intermodal and your truck in your network today, what\u2019s the typical spread and how has that spread changed, if at all, over the course of the last couple of quarters as we\u2019ve seen fuel prices come down? Eric Butler : I think we\u2019ve said historically that the spread can be pretty wide, as much as 25% to 30% in some lanes and it can be narrow, as low as 10%. I think the factors that we\u2019ve been talking about are still there or even growing. The factors being driver shortages, I think that is still a factor that is going to drive conversions. If you look at the experience that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve had another year of record domestic intermodal volumes. You can look at our fourth quarter volumes and we\u2019ve had new products and services. Last year we talked a lot about the new services that we put in place. We opened Santa Teresa, so we\u2019re entering new markets. You still have driver shortages. Growth in domestic intermodal is still a sweet spot. There still is a gap there, but as we are selling out value our goal is to grow volume and close that gap. Justin Long : Maybe just as a follow up to that, do you think that 2015 is a year where intermodal pricing mirrors contractual rate increases and truck load? I\u2019m just curious if this would be the best proxy, truck load rate increases or if there\u2019s a reason you think intermodal pricing should be any different than truck load this year? Eric Butler : We still think we have strong opportunity to grow price in our intermodal book of business. If you look at what happened in \u201914 as demand increased on truck drivers, etc., some truck loads, some truck entities, have shorter term prices so they probably were able to respond quicker than entities that have longer term contractual arrangements, but we feel really good about our opportunity to price going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz - UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : I wanted to ask a bit about legacy contract repricing. I think you highlighted that you were successful in retaining all that was coming due in 2015 and so that was good news, but also pulled forward what was in 2015. I think in the past you talked about - maybe it was a 2013 impact where you got like a 1.5 point boost to pricing, to core price, from legacy. Given the success on legacy in 2015 should we think of that as higher than the 1.5 point impact to core price? Is it more like two points or above that? How can you kind of frame that legacy impact to core pricing in 2015? Robert Knight : What I\u2019ll tell you is it\u2019s a positive but we\u2019re not going to give the specific numbers on that as we never have in terms of our guidance. We\u2019re pleased with the business, we\u2019re pleased that we were able to compete and retain those contracts that we talked about for \u201915 and \u201916 and it will certainly be a positive contributor to our core pricing in 2015. Thomas Wadewitz : Is it reasonable to think it\u2019s maybe a bigger impact than 2013? Robert Knight : I\u2019m not going to answer that. The caution that you\u2019ve heard me say many, many times is that I wouldn\u2019t straight line past performance and overlay that on top of these contracts. When we report our pricing in the first quarter and beyond you\u2019ll see that embedded in the pricing numbers that we report but I\u2019m not going to give any more details on it. Thomas Wadewitz : On a follow up question, the industry had capacity challenges in 2014. Your western competitor perhaps had greater challenges than others and I think it\u2019s fair to say you probably gained some volume as a result of that. How would you think about the impact of that to 2015 volumes? Their velocity seems to be improving. I think you said you believe that you\u2019re adequately resourced so is there some volume that goes back to them potentially? Should we assume your volume growth slows down because you don\u2019t gain share like you did, or how would we frame that potential impact from change in capacity and service performance of your competitor? Lance Fritz : I think overall when you look at the business we were able to move in 2014 the table is set for us to prove the value proposition of Union Pacific versus our competition and our competitor has always been right there chomping at the bit so it\u2019s always a head-to-head competition in any one of those opportunities. Our challenge and our ability to convince those customers that the Union Pacific value proposition is what fits in their business model more effectively is really what we\u2019re all about here. Yes, we may lose some of that business, we may gain some additional business, we\u2019ll just have to see how the competitive world plays itself out in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs. Tom Kim : I wanted to follow on Tom\u2019s earlier question on the legacy reprice. First off, can you just quantify the amount that was up for renewal for 2016 as you highlighted what was for 2016 previously? Robert Knight : I would just call your attention to the last pie chart that we showed at investor day. The revenue that we reflected there, which is based on historical by the way it\u2019s not a projection of what those contracts are going to drive going forward, but we said there was about $300 million of revenue in the legacy bucket for 2015 and about $140 million in that bucket for 2016, so those are the buckets we\u2019re talking about here. Tom Kim : Just the same in regard to the timing, should we factor this in sort of staggered over the course of the year, or is this sort of a January one effect? If you could just give us a little bit of sense in terms of how to be thinking about how that flows through it would be helpful? Robert Knight : The bulk of that $300 million for this year was front end loaded so we should start getting it relatively early on that piece this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group - Wolfe Research. Scott Group : I actually had one more follow up on the legacy stuff. Rob, is there any way to put some color on historically how much of the benefit of a legacy deal was in the base rate and how much was just getting a fuel surcharge for the first time? Could that suggest that maybe the legacy benefit isn\u2019t as good as maybe it would have been now that oil is much lower? That\u2019s one question if you will. Robert Knight : Fuel not only in the legacy contracts but in all of our contracts will obviously play a role in what we report in average revenue per car or per unit. But in terms of your question of can I give you some historical or shed some light on that, the answer to that is no. It was a combination of walking up the pricing on our historical legacy renewals, and as you know, rolling up or improving. It wasn\u2019t always a case of going from zero to adequate. In some cases there were fuel surcharge mechanisms in place in those old contracts, we were just able to look at them and make sure that they were adequate. I would say the same thing applies in this go around, but trying to quantify or give you a percentage split, I can\u2019t give you that. Scott Group : Can you guys just give an update on what you\u2019re seeing at the west coast ports? What contingency plans you have in place in case there\u2019s a lock out and strike, and just how you\u2019re thinking about what the impact there could be? John Koraleski : We\u2019ve been staying very close to the situation and working with our customers. Eric, why don\u2019t you talk about some of the things that we\u2019re doing and thinking about? Eric Butler : I think you probably know that both sides did ask for federal mediation so that mediator was appointed I think, last week or so and they\u2019re going through the process. I don\u2019t think we have any unique knowledge of how that process is going. We\u2019re hopeful that the issue does get resolved. We had put a contingency plan in place in the event of a work stoppage and we\u2019ve communicated those to our customers in terms of the things that we will do to manage our network and do the best job we can of managing customer needs and expectations through a work stoppage. As Jack said, we\u2019re staying close to it. I\u2019m not sure we have any specific knowledge beyond the parties in a federal mediation that is going on. Scott Group : Do you think just the uncertainty is going to have an impact on your volume or your ability to get price? Eric Butler : The uncertainty has nothing to do with price, the price is driven by kind of the market opportunities and the value of our product and that still remains. Certainly, in the short term BCOs are doing what they need to do to protect their supply chain. That\u2019s expected, that\u2019s what has occurred at times in the past when similar labor issues have gone on in any port. We think going forward, that once the issues are resolved and they\u2019re behind, the whole supply chain effectiveness of the rail transportation network, our rail transportation network with the ports of Long Beach, LA, still is a premier way of getting products into this country.  The Southern California west coast destination market is still a huge market so we are very comfortable going forward with the value of our franchise and our proposition once this labor issue is resolved. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob [Zelman] - Deutsche Bank. Rob [Zelman]: As a follow up to Allison\u2019s earlier question regarding the frac sand franchise, could you give us a sense of how the split of that business is broken down by contracts versus tariff pricing and any sort of overall exposure that you guys have to the different shales? Robert Knight : We don\u2019t talk about kind of the structure of our pricing by business. We don\u2019t do that. What I would say, and if you refer back to some of the materials at the investor day, we did share that the majority of our franchise is destined in the Eagle Ford and Permian shale plays. I think we said about 60% of that, but we do have a great broad franchise in all the shale plays whether you want to look at Niobrara, Uinta, if you want to look at Marcellus, Haynesville, etc., we have a great franchise and so we think that does provide us a natural hedge for whatever the change is that the market and these low oil prices may bring. Rob [Zelman]: Rob, switching directions over to the core pricing side of the equation, with the roughly $140 for 2016, will be experiencing step up in 2015 regarding that pricing or are you just kind of saying we\u2019ve already agreed to lock in the pricing which will commence in 2016? Robert Knight : I\u2019m not going to get into the details of that particular renewal. We\u2019re confident with the business that we renewed. We like the pricing, we like the margins on it, but in terms of the timing I\u2019m not going to get into that. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital. Brandon Oglenski : Eric, in the past you guys have quantified your exposure to the frac sand, the crude oil, and the pipe. Is there any way that you can just update investors right now with your aggregate volume exposure to those three segments? Eric Butler : I think in the past, and I\u2019m checking the number, but I think in the past we\u2019ve probably said about 5% of our volume is related to that. I think that\u2019s about the number. Just to be clear you were asking in total what is our oil, frac sand market share percent of our volume and we\u2019ve said 4.5% all in. 2.5% from the sand the rest like, 1.5% from oil, and then the remainder is some of the materials, pipe, etc., just to kind of size our total. Brandon Oglenski : I think Jack hit on it earlier, that you\u2019re seeing quite a bit of improvement in your construction markets so can you talk about - and I know this might be more difficult to quantify, but what\u2019s your exposure to non-res construction or even housing starts and how do you weigh that versus where you think construction projects were going into the energy markets, and does that become a net benefit for you going forward? Eric Butler : I think what you\u2019re asking is geographically where are our markets. We\u2019ve shared before kind of the fastest growing states are kind of in the southwest and the west and then the southeast. Certainly, when you think about the south to the southwest and the west we have a great franchise exposure to those. Certainly, some of the growth has come from the energy related growth in Texas, particularly around the Houston market, but we\u2019re seeing good growth in our construction products in housing in non-Houston non-Texas markets also. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : You mentioned that there\u2019s probably going to be a little shift change between international and domestic intermodal, particularly in 1Q given what\u2019s going on in the ports. Can you remind us the impact that\u2019s going to have on your intermodal yields? A - Eric Butler : We have not discussed what our yield are by our intermodal business. We are seeing positive trends in yields across our book of business whether it\u2019s domestic or international because of our strong pricing, and we expect that trend to continue. Jason Seidl : I\u2019ll ask it a different way. Is there any big difference between the length of haul between domestic and international? Eric Butler : There\u2019s not a significant difference in the length of hauls between those two. There\u2019s a minor difference because again, our domestic business runs east west from the west coast kind of to the Midwest Chicago and Midwest interchange and our international business runs over that same route. The minor difference would be the mix of our business that runs north south which would have a shorter length of haul. Jason Seidl : Sort of related, as a follow up, I guess this may be a little bit more for Lance, but obviously the rail industry was challenged in \u201914 operationally, it impacted sort of everybody\u2019s bottom line. Can you talk about productivity gains assuming everyone shows a little bit of improvement this year in 2014, if we can put a number on it? Lance Fritz : Without putting a number on it I\u2019ll remind you that as we discussed going through 2014 we said we were getting significant productivity and probably a little bit aberrational in that we would have liked to have more crews and locomotives to run the network. As we move into 2015 we expect to continue to get productivity. I would expect it maybe not to be quite as turbo charged as it was in 2014 because we\u2019ll now be matched in terms of resources to demand, but we will get productivity continuing in 2015. John Koraleski : Especially when the cycle times improve we\u2019re able to pull locomotives out of - put them back in storage pull them out of service, those kinds of things. Those are the least productive units that we\u2019ll be storing so there is just some natural productivity occurs as velocity spools up. I think our latest numbers that we reported is a velocity of 25.3 and headed in the right direction so we feel good about that. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Wetherby - Citigroup. Chris Wetherby : Thinking about pricing for a second, if we put legacy aside and think about sort of the underlying potential of the business into 2015, it would appear that we\u2019re sort of getting a little bit of inflection more positively throughout the year of 2014. I just want to get a rough sense of how you think about that outlook for sort of everything ex legacy as we think about the next year? Sort of what you\u2019ve had the opportunity to touch and maybe what could be coming up? Eric Butler : As we\u2019ve said throughout 2014 and as we\u2019re saying today, we feel good about our market value and our opportunity for pricing and we have a strong value proposition, the economy is strengthening and we\u2019re excited about our ability to get price going forward. John Koraleski : We don\u2019t really see anything that\u2019s changing our view on our pricing model at this point in time. Reinvestability has to be the threshold to get onto the Union Pacific franchise, price to market, take advantage of opportunities across the franchises as we see them and we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s happened here recently that would cause us to veer from that at all. Chris Wetherby : As a follow up, on the intermodal side just thinking about the international intermodal side with what\u2019s going on in the west coast ports and the sort of prolonged period of negotiations there, do you have any sense that some of the disruptions that you\u2019re seeing may ultimately be permanent or semi-permanent as shippers look for other alternatives? We\u2019ve talked about this before in the past and my guess is most likely business comes back once we get resolution but I just want to get a rough since maybe how we should be thinking about that. Do you hear that at all? Eric Butler : I think you\u2019re exactly right. Certainly, any shipper in terms of while this uncertainty is here they\u2019re trying to identify options to protect their supply chain and you see that for example, right now with growth into Oakland or shippers trying to get into Oakland which is part of our franchise also. Long term the port of LA, Long Beach, is in a sweet spot in terms of the connectivity with the rail network, our network, our competitor network. Long term the expectation is once these things are behind that will be the preferred option for shippers. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon - Bernstein Research. David Vernon : A couple on trying to get some help in modeling forward RPUs. As you think about the demand outlook, I think we\u2019ve talked about in terms of crude oil and frac sand, should we also be expecting that with reduced demand for sand or oil transportation there\u2019s also going to be an impact on the RPU or is the pricing going to be pretty well divorced from the supply/demand economics in the underlying commodity? Eric Butler : As I\u2019ve said before, we still feel really good about our franchise, and our strength, and our value proposition. We still see upside opportunity to drive value and to drive price in that market. David Vernon : But say the price of frac sand goes down a lot, should we expect that the producer is going to eat that or there\u2019s going to be a little bit of pain shared between the producer and their transportation partner? Eric Butler : We have never and we don\u2019t anticipate ever tying our value of our transportation products to commodity price values. David Vernon : Then maybe just as a quick follow up, as you think about the outlook as we talked about it maybe a little weaker depending on what oil prices do, maybe a little stronger on construction, as you think about that mix impact would you expect that the average RPU on the construction stuff that would be growing would be directionally better or worse than maybe some of the oil related stuff that\u2019s going to be coming down? I\u2019m not looking for specifics I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of directionally what impact that mix should be having on the result. John Koraleski : I think overall when you look at it, it will depend on which market. So, if it\u2019s a manifest business, if it\u2019s a lumber business, things like that tend to have a somewhat longer haul than some of our frac sand. But you know, there are so many moving parts to this that it\u2019s pretty difficult for us to say what mix is going to come our way as we look ahead to the year. David Vernon : Can you give us any insight into that directional sort of average construction unit versus the average crude and frac unit, higher or lower? Robert Knight : The answer is no to your specific question. You\u2019ve heard me say many times that we avoid giving any guidance on average revenue per car and that\u2019s not a negative thing. I think what it says is the strength of the UP franchise is so diverse that we play in multiple markets and just because one piece of business has a lower average revenue per unit is not a bad thing, it might have a higher margin. That doesn\u2019t bother us when we see an average revenue per unit go up or down because it speaks to the diversity, it speaks to the mix. In every case we\u2019re focused on improving our margins. The other thing that\u2019s clearly going to impact average revenue per unit right now and potentially throughout the year is going to be the impact of fuel so you\u2019re going to see I think, some swings up or down but that in and of its self doesn\u2019t trouble us and we can\u2019t give guidance on that. Operator : Your next question comes from William Greene - Morgan Stanley. William Greene : Rob, I wanted to ask a question on the cost side and that is there\u2019s a sense that given the number of locomotives and employees that we\u2019ve added and embedded in the cost structure, if volumes disappoint us perhaps in the second half of the year or whatnot for whatever reason, that you\u2019ve embedded a kind of fixed nature into this cost structure. Can you speak to the variability of the cost structure, how much you could take out if you had to adjust because the markets turned against us in ways we don\u2019t expect? Robert Knight : I would answer that by saying we\u2019re not projecting that. As you know, our guidance is positive volume for the year with all the moving parts. But to your point, I think we\u2019ve sort of proven over the years, when there are times when the economy goes south on us that we\u2019ve taken the right steps and Lance highlighted some of them in his talks, the furlough opportunities, the storage of the less efficient units. If you had to go deeper you\u2019ve got opportunities to consolidate terminal operations, etc., so without putting a number on it I would just tell you that that\u2019s something that we take pride in, in terms of being agile and being able to react to market conditions.  So as Lance pointed out in his comments, we feel like we\u2019re fully resourced right now with people and locomotives. We played catch up, if you will, through the back half of 2014 and we\u2019re confident that there\u2019s still opportunities to grow our business and we\u2019ve got attrition on the labor front still in front of us so we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll make the right steps should what you\u2019re outlining play out. William Greene : Then Jack, I wanted to ask you more on the legislative front we\u2019ve seen that Senator Thune is potentially going to put forward the bill that he\u2019s talked about in the past. I don\u2019t know how much of the bill you\u2019ve seen but maybe you can speak a little bit to is this the sort of thing that you can work with them on? Is there something here that we could get out of this or is it all sort of bad news and we\u2019d rather keep the status quo as we have? Can you speak to any of that? John Koraleski : I think Senator Thune has kind of opened the door to comments and working with the industry and asking us what we think about the provisions of the bill and things like that. We\u2019ve been able to provide some input. As always, we try to be a positive voice at the table and look at both the good opportunities as well as the challenges that each piece of legislation presents and I have no concern that we won\u2019t be able to do that again. I think we\u2019ll have an opportunity here to help shape that piece of legislation and work to mitigate any of the negative consequences and hopefully even add some positives for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Troy - Nomura Securities. Matt Troy : The service issues that plagued the industry through much of 2014, each carrier to varying degrees, operations seem to have stabilized if you talk to a lot of the IMCs out there kind of mid to early fourth quarter with some improvement. I\u2019m just wondering, the next two months are critical from a weather perspective, what specific steps are you taking - you talked about the loco adds, and the crew additions, and the headcount additions, but what do you see as the critical focal points of your service remediation improvement plans let\u2019s call it, in the first three to four months of the year as we look at a winter that so far has been benign? Lance Fritz : Matt, one thing we\u2019ve done is learn from last years\u2019 experience during very difficult weather environments and we\u2019ve beefed up our winter action plans. That includes that at any sign of inclement weather 24/7 command centers locally that can make the right adjustments and calls on the ground. We\u2019ve taken advantage of this benign weather and done some engineering work on our track that is positioning us better for the spring thaw so I\u2019m very pleased with that. We\u2019ve also been working with our interchange partners at critical gateways like Chicago to put in early warning systems that are more robust and have more robust action plans around them and they\u2019ve actually kicked in at different points during this winter, during bitter cold periods, and proven to be very effective. I\u2019m really, really pleased with how we\u2019re navigating this winter notwithstanding that in certain parts of our territory been a more benign winter than last year. Matt Troy : A follow up question would be just to clarify on the surcharge, there seems to be varying opinions out there in terms of the potential benefit of lower fuel costs if they were to remain down where they are currently. If oil stays kind of in this mid $40 range is it fair to think about, you had mentioned I think, something to about the tune of $0.05 of a benefit from lower fuel costs in 4Q, if I just look at the slope and the two month lag it would imply something similar, maybe $0.01 or $0.02 higher. Is that a fair assumption with fuel where it is and should we expect thereon if fuel stays down here at the same level that it becomes somewhat of a wash in second quarter and beyond? Just trying to think about kind of the benefit. I know it\u2019s a long run net/neutral but just timing is obviously an issue here, if you could help us there that would be great. Robert Knight : Matt, under your assumption if fuel kind of stayed in the same neighborhood it is in the first quarter, I would expect that the first quarter looks similar to what we saw here in the first quarter or so and that\u2019s consistent with your thinking. Beyond that, there are 60 plus surcharge mechanisms and we\u2019re not guiding that fuel is going to stay flat forever, but we endeavor of course to keep the cost impact neutral so if it did just flatten out that would be certainly our objective. It doesn\u2019t usually play out that way but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re thinking about it wrong. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research. Jeff Kauffman : Just a follow up, I think most of my questions have been answered at this point. I think you mentioned a higher amount of labor cost per employee inflation in 2015. Could we delve into a little bit more detail on that? In particular I\u2019m thinking more on the pension and benefit side, can you talk about any headwinds that you\u2019ll have in 2015 there? Robert Knight : I said that the labor inflation line for \u201915 was going to be more in the 4% to 5% range and really the big driver of that is wage inflation. There were a couple of kicks, if you will, at wage increases in the contracts that were negotiated several years ago and there\u2019s a kick up of call it half a point or so in that number of higher pension expense as well and those are the two main drivers. Jeff Kauffman : Okay, so mostly base wage? Robert Knight : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar. Keith Schoonmaker : With Santa Teresa open now could you highlight two or three of the capital investments you expect to be most impactful in the next couple of years? Lance Fritz : Let\u2019s go around the railroad a little bit, start down in southeastern part of our network. We\u2019ve been increasing our capital investment in Texas, Louisiana, up into Oklahoma and Kansas both in our north/south routes and in the Texas area. That\u2019ll continue and pay very big dividends for a multitude of commodities that use those routes. We have added about 40 miles of double track on the Sunset. We\u2019re going to continue to add double track there. We\u2019re at a point now we\u2019re about 80% double tracked on that route so that will be good. We\u2019re adding some capacity in the P&W for our critical bulk and premium routes. We\u2019re adding capacity in Chicago. We have a public/private partnership project on our primary corridor in and out of Chicago which is the Geneva Sub, to triple track a critical portion of that\u2019s shared with a metro service and that will be very, very helpful. We\u2019ve also announced a Hearne new network terminal in the middle of Texas and I think at the investor day we talked about a $600 million kind of number and a 25,000 daily car count kind of number and that will be very impactful, probably taking us the next two and a half years or so to build, maybe a little bit more. Keith Schoonmaker : A question on intermodal, looking at the AAR velocity data it appears you maintained your intermodal velocity quite well even when overall velocity slowed a bit. I recognize that velocity is only one measure, but could you speak perhaps to your on time performance within intermodal? Is it where you want it or excluding new intermodal lane offerings is it still an area in which you expect a little improvement? Lance Fritz : We do expect improvement in intermodal. If you look backwards I would not be as charitable in terms of our premium intermodal service in 2014 as you were. Our expectations were for better performance than that. We were able to differentiate the service compared to other services we provide. A real positive note is that in the peak season ending the year we performed very well and as we\u2019re entering this year that same level of performance has sustained. There are opportunities on certain lanes in our premium domestic intermodal franchise, but it is showing better service and I anticipate it will continue to show better service this year. Operator : Your next question comes from [Denis Hartman] - Robert W. Baird. [Denis Hartman]: Going back to the west coast issues, putting aside some of the labor disputes at the moment, how much conversation have you had with some of the international intermodal shippers that are more reluctant today than they have been in the past to allow some of their containers to free flow inland and more interested in doing trans loading activity to make sure the containers get back to Asia? Can you talk about any sort of conversations that you might be having that could affect international intermodal volumes in 2015 and presumably to the benefit of some trans loading in domestic intermodal activity? Eric Butler : As you mentioned, that has been a trend going on for probably three to four years where international shippers are seeing a value proposition of letting their [ISO] boxes or international boxes to just destine on the west coast, trans load into a domestic box, and then go inland. So, that trend we have been seeing for probably three or four years. We think that that is a trend that will probably continue mainly because a lot of the BCOs as part of their supply chain organizations are using the trans loading function as part of their kind of distribution management strategy so it\u2019s less kind of a transportation driven issue but it\u2019s kind of their overall warehousing and distribution center management strategy. We think that is a trend, it will continue. I don\u2019t think that west coast labor issues have any particular significant long term change to that trend that has been going on for several years. [Denis Hartman]: When we look at some of the expected weakness in international intermodal in 2015, we should subscribe it to the ongoing labor dispute and not an acceleration of that trans loading trend? Eric Butler : That would be the assessment right now. Operator : Your next question comes from Cleo Zagrean - Macquerie. Cleo Zagrean : My first question is related to the impact of the recent volatility in the energy markets on your investment in business development. Please help us understand how you are thinking about it. Are you looking at winners and losers from an environment of sustained [load] prices? Are you expecting these to recover? For example, is the southern chemical franchise less of an urgency and consumer related areas more in focus? Please highlight a few areas that are gaining traction in business development for you this year? Eric Butler : I\u2019m not quite sure exactly what the question is. I would say we are continuing a focus on business development. Energy, even with the recent volatility still I think, has some positive drivers for us in North America because we still have relatively low energy price and in fact, even lower energy prices than what we thought earlier. That is going to be a positive driver for things like chemicals production in this country. That\u2019s going to be a real positive driver in terms of continuing the trend that we\u2019ve seen or near sourcing. We\u2019ve talked in the past about trends of manufacturing moving back to North America. We think that\u2019s still - if anything, it\u2019s going to be even a more positive driver from some of the volatility so we still think that\u2019s positive. John Koraleski : I think one of the things as we look at this and as we talk to our customers, first of all this is still a relatively early phenomena in terms of the dramatic reduction in oil prices that we\u2019ve seen. Nobody that I can find expects that this is going to be a long term trend and certainly no one at this point in time has made any decisions to alter long term capital, facility expansions, or things like that. I think it\u2019s just way too early to see if this is sustainable trend in energy prices. Cleo Zagrean : My second question relates to operations, productivity specifically. Can you share with us a few operating initiatives that your team is most excited about this year so that apart from volume and price impact on the operating ratio we can get a sense of where you might gain the next important improvement in the OR? Lance Fritz : One of the things that we talk about routinely that continues to be an exciting opportunity for us is the penetration of [indiscernible]. Our interpretation of lean manufacturing principles and Cameron and the operating team, in fact, the whole corporation is doing a wonderful job of absorbing those principals, turning them into projects and action plans and removing variability out of the network. I can see dozens of different projects at any given time that are going to be paying off either from a productivity perspective, a safety improvement perspective, or a service improvement perspective. That\u2019s the first thing I would highlight. The second thing I would highlight is we\u2019ve got a very robust menu of capital investment that is gaining significant traction as we enter this year and each one of those critical investments is going to make an improvement in safety, in service, and in productivity and unleash different bottlenecks around the network. I\u2019m just really, really jazzed with what we\u2019ve got facing us for the coming year. Operator : Your next question comes from John Engstrom - Stifel. John Engstrom : I\u2019m looking at intermodal and I\u2019m trying to tease out the story which is a difference between competition with truck versus having low diesel prices versus a weaker tail season, things of that sort, also with a soft year on your baseline. Can you talk to me a bit about given your sequential decline in car loads how you think about what the primary drivers were behind that? Eric Butler : You\u2019re talking about an intermodal sequential decline in car loads? What are you looking at? John Engstrom : Yes, I\u2019m looking at the sequential decline between 3Q and 4Q just given the year-over-year comps are a little challenging given the winter in December last year. I\u2019m just trying to tease that story out. Eric Butler : Again, the international side for our intermodal business, all of the west coast labor challenges through the fourth quarter, all of the uncertainty. The domestic side of our intermodal business with the new products and services and the road truck conversions, and the whole story about truck availability and all of that, we\u2019ve had a record year on the domestic side of the intermodal business. John Engstrom : One follow up question on capacity. We talked a little bit about adding crews and locomotives as a primary lever behind velocity. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a bit about your cap ex investments in Fort Worth, Robertson County, opening up Santa Teresa and if you also see that increase capacity as being another lever which is sort of beneficial for you guys on velocity and there\u2019s a bit of a tradeoff moving forward? John Koraleski : Absolutely, the investments that you outlined have helped us in terms of velocity and service performance. You take just a little snapshot like Fort Worth and Tower 55, we increased speed through that facility on both the north/south and east/west route. We increased capacity adding the ability to run an incremental 20 trains a day through the facility and we reduced the complexity of the facility itself and simplified it\u2019s signal systems which is a safety enhancement. One project that did all three and we\u2019ve been seeing the benefit of it and on that particular route that impacts our manifest product to and from the shale play, it impacts our premium intermodal product from the west coast to the southwest United States. You outlined it just right. Operator : Your next question comes from John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets. John Barnes : Just two quick ones. Number one, on the west coast issue if in the event that there is a more pronounced labor action and as much as a shutdown, how much will that impact service level immediately in terms of just equipment balances and then once normal operations resume how long does it normally take you to recover from those imbalances and get the intermodal network, the velocity there back up to normal levels? John Koraleski : We have been monitoring it closely already taking steps storing equipment and staging them in critical locations so that if the next move takes place of a total shutdown we will embargo, we will lock down and not allow the congestion of the ports to impede on the velocity of the rest of our networks. We can\u2019t allow that to happen so we have plans in place to take those steps. We\u2019ve communicated with customers about our intent to do exactly that in the event of a total shutdown and I feel pretty well about our ability to stage and think about this so that if it does happen we will have positioned ourselves for a quick return once services have been restored to the ports? John Barnes : Secondly, the eastern rails have talked a little bit about that their coal franchise has become more surge dependent than base load dependent and therefore more dependent on heating days and cooling days. Where do you believe your coal franchise stands in that paradigm? Are you close to a point where it\u2019s more surge dependent or is the cost benefit still close enough that you\u2019re still seen as a vital piece of the base load in the western US? Eric Butler : Coal remains a vital piece of the base load energy in the western US. It is a critical part of utility and manufacturing fuel source. Lance Fritz : If you think about it, our coal business has been very dependent upon weather whether you have cold or hot summers and those kinds of things and so to that extent there is some surge component. But, I think the interesting thing that Eric talked about in his remarks is a realization that a coal base kind of helps cushion against the volatility of natural gas and I think that realization on the part of the utilities is making it a little more stable than what most people would think. Operator : I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments. John Koraleski : Thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again in April. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This is a 9% increase in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains in the quarter were partially offset by a sharp drop in volume. While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline, we did not run an efficient operation. Total first quarter volumes were down 2%, with particular softness in coal, industrial products and intermodal. Throughout last year, we worked to add the people, locomotives and capacity needed to meet a dramatic increase in demand. By the end of 2014, we had seen full-year volume growth of 7% and we were fully resourced to meet this demand. Over the last few months, however, volume has shifted negative. As a result, our operation is in catch-up mode and not as efficient as it should be. Managing a network is a constant balancing act to ensure you have the right resources in the right place at the right time. This balancing act becomes more difficult during significant volume swings. We're taking the steps to align our resources with current demand, while remaining agile in an ever-changing environment. We remain committed to safely providing excellent service for our customers while improving that service and our financial performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric Butler : Thanks, Lance and good morning. In the first quarter our volume was down 2%, driven by challenges in some key markets. Automotive and ag products volume grew with declines in coal, industrial products, intermodal and chemicals. Milder winter weather and natural gas prices drove softer coal demand, lower crude oil prices reduced demand for shale-related shipments and we also experienced the effects from the drawn-out west coast labor port dispute. I'll talk about more specifics as we walk through each group. Fuel surcharge revenue reduction negatively impacted average revenue per car and was a 4% head wind on freight revenue. However, solid pricing gains across our business led to a core price improvement of 4%, which combined with a 1% mix and drove average revenue per car up 1%. Overall freight revenue was down 1% as the strong pricing gains and mix were offset by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue increased by 3%, on a 3% volume increase and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 2% this quarter. We continue to see strong demand for overseas export feed grain shipments, particularly through the Gulf and Mississippi River. Those gains were offset primarily by declines in wheat exports and to a lesser degree, softer demand for domestic feed grain. Grain products volume was up 4% for the quarter. Ethanol volume grew 7%, driven by increased gasoline consumption and export demand. We also saw increased export demand for soybean meal and a strong canola crop drove increases in canola meal shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3%, driven primarily by continued strength in import beer, partially offset by slightly lower refrigerated food shipments. Automotive revenue was up 6% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 11% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand and reduced impact from winter weather. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the first quarter, up 6.4% from the same quarter in 2014. Auto parts volume grew 3% this quarter, driven primarily by increased vehicle production. Chemicals revenue was flat for the quarter, with a 2% improvement in average revenue per car offsetting a 1% volume decline. Plastics shipments were up 8% in the first quarter, as stability in resin prices resulted in improved buyer confidence in the market. Strength in fertilizer demand this quarter drove volume up 10%. The slight delay in last fall's harvest pushed some application into the first quarter of this year. We also saw strength in export markets, particularly to China. Finally, lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continue to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 38% for the first quarter. Coal revenue declined 5% in the first quarter. Volumes were down 7%, partially offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 1% for the quarter. We experienced a very mild winter this year, which combined with low natural gas prices to reduce demand for coal. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 32% for the quarter, as a mild winter and low natural gas prices drove receiving utilities to switch to other fuel sources. Colorado Utah tonnage was also impacted by soft demand for coal exports. Industrial products revenue was up 1%, as a 3% decline in volume was offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. We continue to see strength in construction products, where volume was up 4% for the first quarter. Demand for rock was strong in the quarter, particularly in the southern part of our franchise. Metals volume was down 17%, as lower crude oil prices significantly reduced new drilling activity. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar drove increased imports, which reduced demand from domestic steel producers. Our government and waste shipments declined 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by a temporary reduction in short-haul waste shipments. As a side note, our minerals business was not a key driver in industrial products this quarter; but I wanted to mention the fact that our frack sand volume was up 3%. Demand remains strong in January, but tailed off significantly in March. I will talk more about our outlook in a moment. Turning to intermodal, revenue was down 5%, driven by a 3% decrease in both volume and average revenue per unit. Due to the structure of intermodal fuel surcharge programs, there was a greater average revenue per unit impact to intermodal this quarter than seen in other commodities. Domestic shipments grew 9% in the first quarter, setting an all-time first-quarter record for volume. We continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for our new premium services. International intermodal volume was down 12%, driven by the west coast port labor dispute, which stretched late into the quarter. We're encouraged that the parties have come to a tentative agreement and we're working with our customers to reduce the backlog and return to normal. Let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In ag products, we expect grain volume to return to normal seasonal patterns through the third quarter and we anticipate exports will favor shorter-haul shipment to the Gulf and river in the near-term. As always, we're keeping a close eye on planning reports and the weather to determine what the next crop will look like. In grain products, we think the ethanol market will remain strong and DDGs will remain steady throughout the year. Finally, we anticipate continued strength in our import beer business and we see potential upside in refrigerated shipments. In automotive, finished vehicles and auto shipments should continue to benefit from strength in sales, driven by a healthy U.S. economy, replacement demand and lower gasoline prices. Coal volume will largely be dependent on the weather this summer and natural gas prices. If natural gas prices remain in the current range, it will be a head wind throughout the year. Also, the latest inventory figures show that stockpiles are significantly up from last year and are now above the five-year historical average, which will likely lead to continued softness. We think most of our chemicals markets will remain solid this year, though we expect that crude oil prices will remain a significant head wind for crude by rail shipments for the rest of the year. Lower crude oil prices will also impact some of our industrial products markets. We expect metals to continue to experience head winds, as capital investments for new drilling activities are reduced. As I mentioned earlier, frack sand shipments were up modestly in the first quarter, but we expect to be meaningfully lower year over year, starting in the second quarter, as demand softens and we come up against tougher comps. On the positive side, we think continued strength in the construction and housing market should drive growth in aggregates and lumber. Finally, we anticipate strong demand for domestic intermodal to continue throughout the year, primarily from highway conversions. For international intermodal, we expect a backlog recovery to continue for the next few weeks, then return to normal seasonal patterns for the remainder of the year. Both domestic and international intermodal should benefit from the strength in consumer demand in the U.S.. To wrap up, we're experiencing some volume head winds created by uncertainty in the coal market and crude oil prices, but we see opportunities in other markets. While top-line revenue will be impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue, we expect solid core pricing gains for the year. As always, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will support new business development efforts throughout the year. With that, I will turn it over to Cameron. Cameron Scott : Thanks, Eric and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance, which is the foundation of our operations. The first quarter 2015 reportable personal injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.85%. These results are a validation that our comprehensive safety strategy is working and we're focused on the right things. I am very proud of the team's commitment to find and address risk in the work place. In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 6% to 3.16. To make improvement going forward, we continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment to help reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet regulatory reportable thresholds. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 27% versus 2014 to a first-quarter record mark of 1.88. Our strategy of reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns is generating results and we will continue our focus in these areas to drive further improvement. In summary, the team has made a nice step function improvement in several areas that is generating results on our way towards an incident-free environment. Moving to network performance, as we discussed, we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust volume levels of 2014. During the latter part of the fourth quarter, our available resources were largely aligned with demand, helping generate the sequential velocity improvement in the network. While we have largely held those velocity levels made in December, we still have more work to do as we exit the first quarter that provided more favorable weather conditions, but one that also saw more extensive track renewal programs on key corridors. While our velocity in the first quarter was almost one mile an hour faster than the first quarter of 2014, our service performance still fell short. As reported to the AAR, first-quarter velocity and freight car dwell were about flat when compared to the first quarter of 2014. However, the team continues a relentless push to improve service and reduce costs. While productivity was not where we wanted it to be, we did generate some efficiencies, even with the decline in volumes during the first quarter. We achieved record train lengths in nearly all major categories, including in automotive, where we leveraged an 11% increase in finished vehicle shipments, with a 5% increase in average auto train length. Our terminal productivity initiatives also continue to generate positive results, as car switch per employee day increased 3%. But our sub-optimal services performance and timing issues with readjusting resources lead to inefficiencies during the quarter. One example of this is locomotive productivity, as measured by gross ton miles per horsepower day, which was down 6% versus 2014. As for our efforts to readjust resources, while we chase volume up -- while we chased volume on the way up last year, it's been a different story in the first part of 2015, with some softer volumes we have seen thus far. To balance our resources to current demand, we have placed around 500 TE&Y employees into furlough or alternative work status. We have also reduced our original TE&Y hiring plan downward by 400 and are now planning to hire around 2,400 TE&Y employees for the year. Of course, we will continue to monitor and adjust our work force levels and hiring plans throughout the year as volume dictates. The same process is under way with our locomotives. By the end of the quarter, we had already moved 475 units back into storage and continue to look at every opportunity to further reduce our active fleet. Also, our planned acquisition of 218 units this year will further improve our overall reliability and efficiency. We have experienced a timing lag in getting our resources aligned with demand, but we're intently focused on balancing our resources and reducing our costs as the year progresses. We're also adjusting our 2015 capital program down $100 million to approximately $4.2 billion. We will continue to invest to improve the safety and resiliency of the network, including more than $1.8 billion in infrastructure replacement programs. Our capital program also includes continued investment for service, growth and productivity, which are primarily concentrated on the southern region of our network; but which also include corridor strategies that reduce bottlenecks across the system. This reduction does not impact our core investment strategy, which is to maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and to invest in service growth and productivity projects where returns can justify the investment. I would also like to give a quick update on positive train control. As most of you know, the rail industry has been required to install PTC by the end of 2015. The required development and testing of this new technology has been challenging. Nonetheless, we have been moving forward, investing approximately $1.7 billion thus far to complete the mandate. Now that the scope of the project has been better defined, we've updated our total project investment in PTC to approximately $2.5 billion. Although UP will not meet the current 2015 deadline, we have been making good faith effort to do so, including field testing since October 2013. The industry has been working to extend the deadline and I think there is general understanding on Capitol Hill that this has to happen. While we remain hopeful that an extension will be passed, our overall investment in the program will not be contingent on the deadline. To wrap up, as we continue on in 2015, we expect to continue generating record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment. We expect to leverage the strengths of our franchise to improved network performance. We will invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and generate productivity gains; and we will remain agile, balancing and adjusting resources depending upon demand to drive improved cost performance. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of first-quarter results. Operating revenue was flat with last year at just over $5.6 billion. Strong core pricing was offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenue and total volumes. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.6 billion, decreasing 4% when compared to last year. The net result was operating income growing 7% to about $2 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $26 million, down from $38 million in 2014. Interest expense of $148 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2014 and at the beginning of 2015. Income tax expense increased to $704 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 6% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, up 9% versus last year. Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.3 billion was down 1% versus last year. In addition to a 2% volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $200 million when compared to 2014. The decline in fuel price was partially offset by the positive lag in the fuel surcharge programs. All in, we estimate the net impact of reduced fuel prices added about $0.08 to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. This includes both the fuel surcharge lag and lower diesel costs. In the second quarter, we expect the net earnings impact of reduced fuel prices to be closer to neutral. Business mix was slightly positive for the quarter, driven by a decline in lower average revenue per car international intermodal shipments. Looking ahead, given the volume shifts between our commodity groups, business mix is likely to have a negative impact on freight revenue's beginning in the second quarter. Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. First quarter core pricing came in at 4%, reflecting a more favorable pricing environment in 2015. This represents a full point to sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Of this, about 0.5% reflects the benefit of legacy business that we renewed earlier this year. This includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals. Moving on to the expense side, Slide 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 9% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense and lower productivity. Looking at our total work force levels, our employee count was up 6% when compared to 2014. About a quarter of this increase was in our capital-related work force. As Cam just discussed, we're adjusting our total hiring downward to better balance our resources. The largest hiring area will continue to be in the TE&Y ranks. In total, when you factor in attrition, training, furloughs and volume levels, we expect our net overall work force levels to be around 48,000 by year end, about flat with year-end 2014. Labor inflation was about 6% for the first quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation and will likely continue to be in the 6% range for the second quarter, as well. Keep in mind that the first and second quarters include the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year, on top of 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including pension. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $564 million, down 39% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 1% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price declined 38% to $1.95 per gallon. Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $643 million. Increased locomotive and freight car material costs were the primary drivers. Depreciation expense was $490 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We expect depreciation expense to increase about 6% for the full year. Slide 27 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million, which is flat when compared to 2014. Other expenses came in at $259 million, up $33 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and casualty costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. For 2015, we still expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% on a full-year basis, excluding any unusual items. Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%, improving 2.3 points when compared to 2014. Our operating ratio benefited about three points from lower fuel prices, including the fuel surcharge lag. Keep in mind, however, we also lost the revenue benefit from our energy-related volumes as energy prices declined. Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations increased to just under $2.1 billion. This is up 17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of cash tax payments. We also invested about $1.1 billion this quarter in cash capital investments. As Cameron just noted, we now intend to spend about $4.2 billion in capital for the full year, down about $100 million from our previous estimate. Given the sharp decline in fuel surcharge revenue, capital spending well likely be greater than the 17% of revenue this year. Longer term, however, we still expect capital spending to be about 16% to 17% of revenue, assuming of course that fuel returns to somewhat higher levels. One housekeeping item to note on the cash flow statement. As you know, in the first quarter we changed the timing of our quarterly dividend payments so that the cash outlay occurs in the quarter for which the dividend is declared. As a result, we had two dividend payments during the quarter -- one for the fourth quarter of 2014 and one for the first quarter of this year. This is the only time we will see this, this year. Together, these payments totaled about $922 million. We also increased our first-quarter dividend by 10%. This is in line with our commitment to grow the dividend payout target to 35%. Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $15.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion at year end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 42.6%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We remain committed to an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio in the low to mid- 40% range and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute on our cash allocation strategy. Our profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and to grow shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we bought back about 6.9 million shares, totaling $807 million. Between the first-quarter dividend and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the quarter. This represents roughly a 23% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value. That's a recap of the first-quarter results. As we look towards the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors that we'll be watching very closely. On the revenue side, we expect a favorable pricing environment to continue, supported by improving service and our strong value proposition. We remain committed to solid core pricing above inflation. As for volume, the outlook is a little more uncertain. The recent challenges that we've seen in coal and in the shale-related markets are likely to continue. At this point, we think coal volumes in the second quarter could be down in the mid-single-digit range versus 2014, with ongoing softness throughout most of the year, as Eric discussed earlier. For the year, strength in other areas could offset these headwinds, depending on what happens to the drivers, ranging from consumer spending to the size of the 2015 grain harvest. Of course, as I previously noted, the volume mix shifts could also have a negative revenue impact. We will just have to see how it all plays out this year. From the cost perspective, the second quarter will likely still reflect some impacts of operating inefficiencies, although as Cameron noted, we will see gradual improvement in productivity over time. As I mentioned earlier, if fuel prices stay close to where they are today, the net impact on earnings should be neutral for the remaining quarters of the year. Taken together, we have our work cut out for us again in 2015, but we will continue our unrelenting focus on safety, service and shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Rob. As you've heard from the team, we've had some challenges to start off the year; but we're taking the steps needed to work through those challenges and realize the opportunities we see ahead. As Eric mentioned, weakness in our coal and shale-related markets could persist for some time; but we continue to see gradual improvement in the underlying economy, which should be a positive for other parts of our business. When you consider other wild cards, from the next grain harvest to the strength of the U.S. dollar, it all adds up to a dynamic environment. That's the nature of our business. Our goal is to provide our customers with excellent service wherever the need arises. We expect to see solid improvement in network performance and cost efficiency over the coming months. As we leverage the strengths of our diverse franchise, we continue to be intently focused on safety, service and shareholder returns. Now let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : First I wanted to ask you on coal, it seems like the macro backdrop's pretty challenging. You acknowledge that -- particularly, low natural gas prices. But I'm wondering, your mid-single-digit decline seems somewhat optimistic versus the trend we have seen recently. There's been more like, I don't know, down 10%, 15%. What is it that leads you to say mid-single-digit instead of worse and how much visibility do you have to that? Lance Fritz : Eric, do you want to take care of that? Eric Butler : Yes. As you know, Tom, a lot of factors go into play, as there was a relatively mild winter, a narrow serving territory of our utilities. The heating days were down 5% to 10% versus last year. We're assuming more normal weather patterns for the balance of the year. That clearly is a factor. The other factor, as you know, is this is typically the shelf months. We see this every year where you don't really have heating or cooling during the spring. Again, we're assuming we're going to get back to normal, seasonal weather patterns. As we mentioned, natural gas prices -- what happens with that will have an impact. A lot of factors, but that's our best assessment at this time. Tom Wadewitz : The second or the follow-up question on the resource levels, you indicated a number of times that inefficiency, or let's say a time lag in resource production versus volume. How do we think about how that will play through in second quarter? Do you catch up pretty quickly and see reduction in resources? Do you expect train speed to improve? How do you think that plays out in terms of the margin performance? Does that really kick in and support margin improvement, or is that something where the revenue head wind is more the dominant factor in terms of, again, looking how that affects the OR or the margin performance? Lance Fritz : Sure, Tom. Thinking about the time lag. We talked to you all last year about trying to catch up with the volume. Then in the fourth quarter, we indicated we had finally caught up and were fully resourced. Then coming into the first quarter of this year, volume shifted what I would consider fairly dramatically to be negative, ending up 2% down. It's really all about being caught in a rip tide, being behind the curve in terms of getting our resources right-sized. When we look forward into the second quarter, we have indicated that we're anticipating better service and better efficiency. We haven't put a stake in the ground and said exactly how that happens, but we anticipate -- and I see it happening right now on the network -- we anticipate continuous improvement as Cameron and his team get the business right-sized. Rob or Cam, any additional comments? Eric Butler : I would add to that list them. We're always focused on improving the margins. As Lance pointed out, we're focused on continually spruce bit on the cause the balancing the network. We will have challenges as I pointed out of the mix yet we anticipate taking hold in second quarter and beyond. Even with all of that activity, we're always going to be focused on improving are margins of where we're today. Operator : Next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : First question on the top-line. If you think about the range of potential downside on the frac business, have you guys try to look into that at all as far as how much demand maybe down as we get into second quarter? Lance Fritz : Yes so a lot of things can change that or drive that, as you know, particularly, coal prices. We look at the outlook right now. We see a mid- teens kind of a range. We see our business to look more like '13 volumes than '14 volumes. David Vernon : Okay and then maybe a quick follow-up, the core pricing gains of 4%, I think, Rob call you mentioned inflation is going to be on the labor side, unusually high this year because of the new labor agreement. How do we think about that in terms of your expectation about pricing above inflation? Are you expecting more productivity for back half of this year? How do we think about the pricing inflation relationship? Or do we think that pricing that he gets better in the 2nd and 3rd quarter as reported? Lance Fritz : David, just to [indiscernible] question, we have been consistent and clear that when we're pricing in the marketplace we're pricing for our value proposition. Whatever either Eric or Rob want to comment on, it's in that context, our pricing in the marketplace is our volume. Lance Fritz : I want to say, David, long-term view is pricing above in place in. Not necessarily core pricing [indiscernible] to inflation and we expect higher labor inflation. Overall, for the year, expect overall company inflation to be in the 3%, 4% range. That gives you a guiding light in spite of the challenges we know we're going to face on the labor line. Overall, companywide we think about 3% copper% rate for the year. David Vernon : The 4% includes the legacy reprice, right? Lance Fritz : To make the first quarter does include legacy for pricing, yes. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Rob Salmon : As a clarification to David's last question in you're prepared remarks, Rob. You had indicated that the core pricing accelerated to 4% in the first quarter. I think you had mentioned that roughly half of that was attributable to legacy. Was that half of the step up from three to four or just half of the four in aggregate? Rob Knight : Let me clarify that. Of the 4% core pricing reported in first quarter one-half of a point of that. 3.5% to 4%. .5% was attributable to the legacy renewals. Rob Salmon : I appreciate the clarification. Kind of taking a step back to going back to investor day, toward the end of 2014, you had indicated that your longer-term full-year volume outlook is positive. I guess given the drop-off that we have seen in terms of shale-related business and coal challenges you indicated, as well as uncertainty in terms of [indiscernible] you still have confidence that the volume growth in aggregate will be positive or do you see that a little bit more challenging as we look out from here? Lance Fritz : I will let Rob answer that in a little more in detail but, the thing that we think about is the beauty of our franchise, the strength of our franchise and all of the opportunity that it represents. We've have got a diverse book of business and over time we have seen that there are always areas where we can develop more business and grow. And so we feel still quite bullish about in the long term being able to grow based on this great franchise. Rob Knight : Lance, I would add your comment caught we know we have some challenges right now but if you look at the UP franchise, it's a fabulous franchise that has great optimism long-term. . inventories are high right now, gas prices are low, energy prices are low which is impacting our frac business. All of those are going to balance out over the long-term. You add-on top of that what's happening in the chemical franchise, the opportunities still in front of us longer-term with the investments being laid in the Gulf. You look at Mexico franchise and we're the only rebel that interchanges at the six border crossing and look at all of the opportunities taking place there. You look at our strong auto franchise. You add it all up. The diversity of our business mix and strength of our franchise caught long-term supervised a stronger optimism which is why we make think longer-term expectation still is volume will be on positive side of the ledger. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Bill Greene : Rob can I ask you to put, maybe if you can little bit finer point on some of the challenges on the cost side in the first quarter? I think, last year, the sort of estimated we had about a $35 million headwind from the weather. Can you estimate what the headwind is from some of the inefficiencies that occurred in the network this quarter? Rob Knight : Bill, you are right. Last year we pulled in about $35 million of a deficiency tied too significant weather events, primarily in Chicago area. This year clearly our cost performance in the first quarter is not we would like it to be. If you take fuel off of the table, our costs were about to enter billion dollars up year-over-year. It's a combination of things that we all had talked about this morning. We had some timing issues. We've resourced for unexpected coming into the quarter higher level of volume. We had some mechanical activities that we took on that I would categorize as timing. And then as we pointed out with had inefficiencies in the network. Without putting a splitting hairs in terms of where those dollars are, we think they are all there for us to right-size the network. If you look at what you would have expected if you are running optimally and had you had things timed up a little bit better, you probably had a negative in the quarter of about 122-point in operating ratio. That's how I would look at it. Bill Greene : Okay and then your point about second quarter is it will still take some time for the network to get to the operating efficiencies that you want. Maybe it will be less than the first quarter impact but still meaningful. Is that what you were trying to communicate? Lance Fritz : Yes and, Cameron, why don't you walk us through a little bit about the activities that are underway to get these things right-size and get your-- Cameron Scott : We still have work to do that we think we can eventually right-size the network in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we do think there was some inefficiencies throughout the quarter but the rightsizing of our locomotive fleet, weekly we review opportunities to store additional locomotives and several times a month we're also rightsizing our hiring plans as we look out for the remainder of the year. Bill Greene : Okay. Rob, let me ask you one last wish into that here. Just on share buybacks, how opportunistic can you be or is the first quarter run rate kind of what we should expect? I mean, if the shares are down a fair amount can you wrap this up? Do you feel you would rather have a BA consistent buyback each quarter? Rob Knight : As you know, our approach has always then and we'll continue to be opportunistic in the marketplace. We don't have a set number of dollars or shares we will buyback inning in any quarter but I will assure you will continue to be opportunistic as we move forward. The current price is frankly an opportunity for us. Operator : Our next questions is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Lance, in context, your 1st quarter wasn't that bad. Earnings were up 9% even with all of the challenges you had and yet it sounded like the tone from everyone on the call here is that we're not too happy with that. Obviously, we could have done better. It did miss Wall Street expectations here and I think over the long run, you guys have them better at staying at expectations relative to some of the other stocks in the space. I think investors have reported your company for that. As I hear it from some of the questions and the answers here, it sounds like we still have crossed challenges.  We're catching up for new volume reality. We don't know energy and coal markets are going to shake out. As your content more difficult on earnings growth this year, consistent reps a plop in 2015. Is a getting more challenging to see double-digit growth this year? I know you don't want to explicitly guy but can you help folks on this call understand where these year could shakeout? Lance Fritz : Sure, Brandon and you're exactly right. We're not going to speak specifically about what to expect from the year from percentage perspective. I think you've got the tone pretty well right. When I look at the first quarter, I am proud of the hard work that the team did in terms of trying to get the cost suggested to the volume reality. I'm disappointed that we couldn't have done better because we, here at the table, see the opportunity of what the franchise really has the ability to deliver. Having said that, I am confident as I look forward that are operating team and all of the teams are focused on doing the right thing. As we look forward, we're adjusting to current volumes at the same time as we're trying to determine what this peak season and looked like and what the growth rate look like from here. I will tell you, there is no change in my confidence both this year and over the long run of being able to generate out of this wonderful business, this beautiful franchise, the kind of financial performance and return generation that you have seen historically. As we have said before, it gets more difficult from 65% or 64%, 63% operating ratio, but we remain absolutely confident it's there, we will realize it and continue to realize it. Brandon Oglenski : Could you maybe talk a little bit more explicitly about some of the drivers of margin improvement this year outside of the benefit from the fuel surcharge? It seems like you do have a bit of compensation benefit headwind given the wage increases. Obviously, if volume could come in flat or maybe even negative for the year given some of the uncertainty, what's the ability to drive leverage in the business then? Lance Fritz : So Brandon, I think Rob and the team have outlined a core portion of that this morning which is, as we look forward as Eric said, we're in an environment where pricing, core pricing gains looks good. Cameron and team are working on rightsizing the business and generating efficiencies through the UP way and taking variable out of the network and looking for all other opportunities to generate margin improvement. Rob, anything else you want too at? Rob Knight : I would just remind you that it's the same levers that have got us from where we were many years ago to where we're today. While volume is our friend how we don't use it as an excuse. You saw us perform well in years when volume did not play to our benefit. We know we have some challenges here with volumes. We've got challenges with mix as I called out but we're going to continue to be relentlessly focused on cost control and cost management, as Lance and Cameron have outlined. As Eric talked about, pricing's note key driver. We improved by the proposition and marketplace and pricing will continue to be a strong driver of that. To get to are longer-term widens of a 60 plus or minus operating ratio by full-year 2019, it's going to take those same efforts and same focus from the organization that we're going to continue to focus on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : I just want to try to understand a little bit better about sort of what the outlook was internally as you guys thought about 2015 and in particular the volume opportunity. I know you were looking for any positive volumes for the full-year and that was rolled in question, we have had tough comps sort of understood coming up in that next quarters. As you're trying to adjust to volume environment, I'm trying to understand where your heads were at coming into this year versus where we're now. It seems maybe a little bit bigger of a change than anticipated. And what to make sure I understand that. Lance Fritz : Chris, we don't specifically address what our budgets are forecast coming into the year. What I will say is the big change is actual growth and then actual decline. The biggest change there was coal which was somewhat surprising in terms of how weak it turned out quickly. Of course we had difficulty with the West coast ports and labor dispute. We have pretty good visibility to that. Looking forward, Eric, why don't you talk to us about what your markets look like as you look into the future. Rob Knight : Yes, I think what Lance said is accurate. The big swing, especially first quarter, we talked about the international intermodal West coast port labor dispute and we think will kind of normalized throughout the year but the big swing factor is coal. As you know, Chris, as you go back really probably four months, oil price outlook for the year was still up in the 90s and is now in the 50s. Of course, that had a swing factor that is impacting broad swaps of the market also. Chris Wetherbee : I guess that certainly makes sense. Maybe sticking on that coal question and maybe one for you, Eric, in terms of mid- single digit outlook in the second quarter that you are thinking about Colorado Utah underperformed pretty meaningfully relative to PRB in the first quarter. Is that inherit in the second quarter outlook would you expect PRB to soften a bit on comps and then you still have weakness in Colorado Utah? I'm just trying to get a rough sense of how you think about coal? Lance Fritz : The mid- single-digit assumes a continued profile with Colorado Utah Copper to get her to come because we're not expecting export markets to pick up significantly this year. Chris Wetherbee : So will be roughly more performance we have seen? Lance Fritz : Thereabouts caught driven, again, by weather and natural gas prices. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Rob, I wanted to ask you about some of the yield drivers in terms of how much of a negative to you think makes could be in the second quarter? And then on the pricing, the 50 basis points from the legacy pricing, maybe is a little lower than would have expected. Wondering if that's a timing issue and that Rams or is this the volumes are down which limits the impact of the legacy repricing and it's going to stay about 50 basis points the rest of the year? Rob Knight : Yes let me address the mix comment. As you know, we don't give specific guidance around mix because there's come again , beauty of our franchise is we have a lot of diverse business opportunities. As a result, not common to have a fair amount of mix. We're highlighting that given the change anticipated in both the coal and fracking environment. And continued strength in our intermodal that's likely versus the first quarter, likely to be a bit of a mix headwind as the rest of the year plays out. How precise that will be, we will have to see. I'm not going to give precise guidance around that. In terms of your pricing question on the legacy contributor, as I have always said, you can't straight-line. Don't take what we repriced in past years on legacy and assume that each contract is the same. They are all different. That was what those contracts on a GAAP to market and that's what we took them up too. To your point, broadly, not just on legacy but I would say broadly, the way we look conservative Lee at calculating our prices, you know, the fact that volume was down in some key markets did have a negative impact on the way we continued brute price. I view that as positive as volumes recover we expect to enjoy the improved returns on those business volumes we have been able to reprice. Scott Group : Okay and the contract you repriced 416, is that showed up in this number already? Were they just right at the actual impact does not show up until mixture? Rob Knight : It's also in that number. Scott Group : Okay. And last thing, just to go back to the question about the buybacks. Was your point about the extra dividend payment in the quarter, in your mind, does that have an impact on how much you bought back the first quarter? And as you go to a more normalized dividend just once a quarter, there's more or less for the buyback or they are independent? Lance Fritz : They are independent. I was just calling out folks understood there were two differ payments in the quarter. I would not make any correlation to that on my share buyback pace. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Just kind of a follow up on some of the volume commentary. Maybe Eric, just talk a little bit, a little bit on chemicals given that usually a precursor for a comedy and we see trend week lately. Longer-term your looking at plant opening up a Gulf region but more in near-term this year, is that a precursor for industrial side of the comment? Given set their. Eric Butler : As you know chemicals business improved by rail was actually pretty good on the first quarter. We were up one percentage, two percentage points in the first quarter net accrued by rail. We think that is a precursor to the economy. Plastics business really ties pretty closely to construction and automotive and all of those and even on consumer side and retail side of house call plastics business was up in first quarter as we mentioned. We think that all of those trends indicate the strengthening North American economy. As Rob said earlier, we had some headwinds and coal, some headwinds we shale stuff that if you net that out, we feel pretty good about some of the underlying strength of the economy. Ken Hoexter : Just a follow-up, Lance, maybe there is a lot of discussion at out east and in Canada about industry consolidation. Can you address union does we did this a couple of quarters ago but perhaps revisit your thoughts on how the market has changed over time and your thoughts given some of the activities or discussion on the eastern and Canadian half of the country? Lance Fritz : Current discussions have not changed our position on industry consolidation. We're not in favor of it. We don't think it is the right thing to do at this time. Operator : Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John Larkin : You had mentioned that grain exports in some cases were still pretty strong but export haul was getting it. That was due to be very strong dollar. At you give us more complete picture of the impact of the strong dollar on the exports across more than just grain and coal? Lance Fritz : The grain exports really were driven by milo and soybeans. We had a great soybean crop in and China is really pulling those into China and spreads between Gulf Coast, West Coast have narrowed in terms of ship spread. That really is driving milo and beans from central part of U.S. into China which was a positive for us. We're still seeing headwinds from the strong dollar in exports across, probably, a pretty good chunk of the economy. When you think about steel, steals being impacted, both with imports come particularly, from Asia coming into the country and domestic steel producers are struggling is also being impacted in terms of machinery exports, construction and farm machinery exports, headwinds because of strong dollar. On the weak side, we're seeing some difficulty in the U.S. wheat crop competing in export markets partially being to the strong dollar. The strong dollar is, as you would expect, impact the exports are pretty wide swath of the economy beyond just coal and it is helping imports. You should see our intermodal import business and other import business strengthen as you go throughout the year but the strong dollar is having an impact. John Larkin : And maybe a question on the ever-changing energy markets. Do you have a sense for where oil prices would have to go in order to recharge the activity levels in the shales and then related to that, how high would natural gas prices have to go in order for the utilities to switch from natural gas back to coal? Lance Fritz : If I could predict energy markets, I would probably be sitting in a different spot than today. There is a lot of conventional wisdom out there and I think the conventional wisdom was that you needed to be in the 70s for the U.S. shale markets to be strong. I think even if you look today with oil in the 50s, there is some shale but it's still going pretty strong. Permian shale is still doing relatively well. The Eagle Ford shale is not. I think there is a spread there, again, conventional wisdom on natural gas is somewhere in the three, 3.5, 350 is probably in the crossover range but, again, depends on a pot of different things like utility by region of the country. Eric Butler : John, just a little more detail. Clearly, we like to see oil prices back in the 75 cross-trained. Clearly, that would be better for us. John Larkin : But all of the guidance has been wrapped around no change and energy prices going for 2015, is that a fair assessment? Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Following up on your earlier comments on the underlying strength in base chemicals and prospects, can you remind us how much for business is tied to the housing and residential construction markets? Yesterday, we saw existing home sales numbers that surprised to the upside and new forms Tom starts are expected to be pretty solid for the year. I wanted to get a view of sort of an all-inclusive perspective of the commodities that you move that are tied to these markets and what that represents as a percentage of volume or revenues. Lance Fritz : I think, historically, we have set between 5% and 2%. We still think that's a good estimate. Housing starts were down in February and March. I think the housing start number comes out today or tomorrow. I think there is some expectation that weather has impacted the number being down the last couple of months and the existing home sales number was very strong, as you say. Again, we tend to factor that into our optimism about the underlying strength of the economy. Allison Landry : As a follow-up question, given that your main competitor has seen modest improvement in velocity, albeit some easy comp's, do you think that the risk of losing some of the traffic that you gained last year as a result of their issues is now somewhat heighted? It seems like there's plenty of traffic as you go around at the West Coast ports but BNSF yesterday actually made comments it has regained some lost Ag business. So I just wanted to get your perspective there. Lance Fritz : The BNSF stuff has been showing improvement in their service product. We would anticipate that would happen. They are very good, vibrant competitor. Eric had said, historically, some of the business we had shipped last year, certainly, in Ag maybe to a lesser extent some other commodities was naturally a better fit for their franchise, there network and would likely go back. I think you see that in the Ag line in terms of reported volumes. Eric, do you want to add anything to that? Eric Butler : No. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Tom Kim : I have a couple of questions. First on intermodal. Can you give us a sense how much your intermodal volumes might have been impacted by the west coast port congestion and how you think it will take that congestion to unwind to sort of filter into this Q2 numbers? Eric Butler : So international intermodal volume was down to the low teens in the first quarter. Again, we expect that as you catch-up throughout the year that that will normalize and most of that will catch-up. We do not expect to see any permanent deterioration of our West Coast international intermodal business. Tom Kim : Okay. Would it be possible to give us a sense of how much your filter fuel surcharge might have impacted ARPUs for that commodity group? Rob you had mentioned that impacted in the first quarter little bit more than the rest of the book of business. Rob Knight : We don't break out by commodity in specific surcharge contributed to each individual commodity but there are timing differences by different contracts and we have some 60 plus different mechanisms. There can be and there are timing differences on the intermodal line versus some of the other lines. Tom Kim : Okay. And then just with one, Rob, as a follow-up, you had commented that you anticipate some potential makeshifts ahead which could impact your revenues. Can you talk about how the mix shift is going to affect your RTMs versus carloads? Because I noticed that your RTMs were down about 4% in the first quarter and carloads were down about 2%. I would think this going to impact your real productivity unit cost and ultimately margins. So I'm just wondering if you could help us frame how we should think about the impact of efficiencies that might be affected by RTMs potentially being weaker than carloads? Lance Fritz : I'm not going to break it out at this point as you are asking, Tom, but I would say mix is something we deal with. From a cost standpoint that just presents challenges and opportunities depending what the volume actually is for the operating team and Cameron's all over it improving the cost structure. In terms of the top-line, the pricing line or the impact on revenue, again, it will depend out which markets are stronger than others. We do anticipate as I called out there will be a headwind for the balance of the year. A simple explanation for why there is ahead hit headwind of it in our revenue line is we think there will be stronger growth and a lot of his recovery with intermodal we just talked about and soft as a goal and frac markets those are the negative drivers on that, if you will cap next headwind we anticipate. We're calling that out directionally as a challenge but we're not using that as an excuse not to continue to run as efficient operational the cost side as we possibly can. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Seidl : When you look at your core pricing of 3.50%, kind of in line with what I expected but is it occurring in certain areas in terms of, are you getting more pricing now out of that truck competitive business then you were 1 year ago? Is that what is driving the improvement? Eric? Eric Butler : We're getting a good market waste pricing across our business. As we said before, a certain percentage of our business has been fixed on multi-year, longer-term contracts and you can't touch them. We talked about that before but for the things that we're able to reprice, the demand is strong. The impacts in terms of the challenges of the trucking industry is having are in our favor and we see strong opportunities to price out value across our book of business. Jason Seidl : Doesn't it get any easier to price intermodal products once the port clears up or did that not really have much of an impact on your pricing? Eric Butler : Pricing is always difficult no matter when you do it. I would guess most of the international intermodal business would not be in spot pricing type of agreements. Jason Seidl : Okay. And to piggy back on Allison's question as a follow-up, you obviously benefited from BN last year in several different categories and you locked up some of that business in some longer-term contracts. One of those does when you those contracts start expiring? Eric Butler : We don't talk about individual contracts. I don't think we mentioned that last year. We don't talk about individual contracts. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben Hartford : Eric, I did wanted to follow up on domestic intermodal pricing in particular given the decline in crude, I know there are certain lanes now where you can find intermodal pricing all-in that is competitive to trucks you guys are more insulated to that with the longer length of haul. Let's assume that crude does stabilize here around $50, $55 a barrel. As you look into '16, do you see a situation where intermodal rate growth does have to lag, truckload rate growth going forward at current levels of crude because of the lower energy price? And some of that disparity, historical disparity between truck and intermodal might have narrowed over the past several years? Can you provide some perspective there? Lance Fritz : Yes, I guess I'm not white understanding the foundation of your question. I think actually truck pricing is increasing. If you look at most of the truck pricing indexes, because of the challenges that the truck industry is having, they are getting high single-digit type price increases. So I think would suggest instead of the gap narrowing it might even be expanding rather than staying the same. Ben Hartford : Yes got truck pricing has increased. I was asking as we go into '16, should we expect domestic intermodal pricing growth to mimic truck load or does it need to lag what the truck load rate growth is to make sure there is enough of an all-in price delta between truck and intermodal? Lance Fritz : We have a value proposition and we're going to continue to price tag as strongly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : I want to go a different direction. We're hearing a lot about the drought in California, the lower water tables, the reduction water use and also during the quarter, we heard those I think we focused with port issues on inbound movement of products. We also heard there was a fair amount of Ag and produce related products that could not get off the West Coast. Could you discuss how that affected you in the quarter and how you're thinking about this drought in California in terms of the growth of your Western business? Eric Butler : The drought in California, as you know, the authorities right now in California are trying to insulate the Ag industry and really are putting the onus for water conservation on residential customers. Politically, how long that can sustain with the Ag industry being insulated is anybody's guess. I do think that if you look at the Ag industry in California, you kind of profile who uses the most water to the least water, I think our customer base will probably be in the using the least water category. So we feel pretty good that the drought will not have near-term material impacts on our food and refrigerated business. We feel pretty good about that. Short of some Armageddon type of scenario. In terms of the export question, yes. So Ag products, particularly refrigerated products do go export off West Coast ports and they were similarly impacted just like the imports were impacted so just like things couldn\u2019t get on, things couldn't get off and they similarly had impacts fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year. Jeff Kauffman : As a follow-up thought last year we heard about truckers moving water into California on an as needed basis. Maybe I'm going off the deep end here but is that a potential revenue source for you over the long run? Lance Fritz : I do not think that's material. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question. Matt Troy : I had a question, as you talk to your utility customers you mention natural gas switching impacting some of the Colorado Utah basin business. Just curious what the echoes of 2012 still lingering, how should we think about the potential for additional or incremental vulnerability in your coal business. What's your sense in speaking with coal customers that as natural gas approaches to 250 now and potentially lower, how much has switched to how much remaining could switch? What is the vulnerability there? Lance Fritz : I think the things that can switch probably have switched. As natural gas goes lower, there might be some incremental impact you would expect there would be. But I think we have seen mostly-- Eric Butler : Comments on that, Matt, if you recall last time natural gas prices got to historically low levels. We really in our territory didn\u2019t see materials switching until it got sub $2. That doesn't necessarily predict the future but what we're seeing though and I think the bigger impact to date rather than our utility based switching from one source to another, they are able to buy electricity off the grid that is being produced by somebody else, perhaps, from gas. So we\u2019re seeing that impact as opposed to a pure switch, turning off the coal plant and turning on the gas plant in our territory. Matt Troy : And my follow-up would be, you mentioned PTC, I'm just curious there, I think when it was initially enacted, no one believed that it would be completed by 2015 in many of the various stakeholder groups but here we're knocking on the deadline. Curious in terms of your conversation with Washington, what it is it industry is proposing as the path forward in terms of either time frame or incremental expansion to the window? And coming off the wall question here, what if Washington in all it's rational thought and reason decides to hold you to letter of law? What will be the implication if the industry does not make the deadline and they are not flexible? Thanks. Lance Fritz : I will start with a path forward. Cameron had mentioned, we believe that, virtually, everyone involved understand there has to be an extension because the industry is not going to make the date. That extension is going to have to come through Congress. There are a number of different vehicles that could make that happen and we're monitoring all of those potentials. And giving feedback and input into our thoughts to help navigate that process. From the perspective of having an extension occur, I remain confident that that will happen. It just reflects the reality of the situation. From the perspective of what if we don't get an extension? There are penalties outlined in the current regulation, current law and we've been discussing what our actions would be should an extension not occur. That would be a horrible outcome for the industry. And I don't believe that's the way it's going to go but we will be prepared for that very, very, remote possibility, as the year comes to a close. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. John Barnes : First on the port situation, can you talk a little bit about -- you have been through this a couple of times before. Can you talk a little bit about your view of a return of market share to the western coast ports or do you think some of what's swung to the east coast and other ports is more permanent in nature? Lance Fritz : We've said for quite some time that there may be as a low single digit number of share transfer from West Coast to East Coast when the Panama Canal opens up. The reality from our perspective is the most efficient vessels and the ones that are being commissioned, as we speak, A, they won't go through modified Panama Canal and B, there needs to be some significant work to occur on the East Coast ports in some circumstances to handle those. Having said that, there is also a natural cost/value proposition that makes those imports want to come into the West Coast. Eric, you want to add anything to that? Eric Butler : No. I think that about covers it. John Barnes : So you still view it as a couple of percentage points in market share? Eric Butler : Yes currently East Coast has about 31. Historically, we\u2019ve said that could go to 33 with the Panama Canal opening but as Lance said, the larger ships that are being built today really won't even be able to go through the expanded Panama Canal. There is a value proposition for the West Coast. If you look at ship spread in terms of the West Coast versus East Coast and if you look at the cost of over land, bridge, rail, transportation, there is a natural economic driver to the West Coast. John Barnes : Okay. My other one is, I know you've got an uncertain volume environment right now at play. I get where the pressure points are but if 2014 taught us anything is you can get caught on the other side in a more robust growth environment just as easily. How do you go about balancing where to pull in right now? Where to pull the rings in, especially given what you experienced in '14 where you really ran out of certain resources? Can you make sure you don't pull back so much trying to balance in this environment that should growth reaccelerate that you're not back in that same similar situation as you were in 14? Cameron Scott : In 2014, our locomotive surge fleet strategy served us very, very well. When business came on, we are able to match that business. So as we look into this year, redeveloping that search fleet and being agile, as we mentioned, is a very critical asset and very critical initiative for us. We take Eric's forecast and where he predicts business will be and then we make our moves appropriately. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : With respect to West Coast ports, I was just wondering if you could comment on the challenges associated with big ships and new shipping alliances which may remain once the backlog is cleared and what you are doing internally and with your supply chain partners to cope? Lance Fritz : You are right, there is going to be a challenge and basically the challenges because the new alliances, as they bring their business together, they bring it all to one terminal and then overwhelms the capacity of that individual terminal on the port vis-a-vis being spread out between multiple terminals. So that is a challenge. The alliances are working through that the challenge of terminals are working through. There was a challenge was starting to be seen before even the ports slow down. We from outside are working with our customers developing planning practices and protocols in capacity management protocols that we're sharing with them to basically say, here is the capacity within this window that we can do into the extent that there is a larger than that flood because of alliance activity through the terminal, what do you need to do to correct that? So we did see it in the past. We will see it in the future. We're working with them to spread that out. Cameron Scott : Are most important asset in LA basin to stay up against the intermodal businesses is locomotives. And we have spent over the last year developing a model that stays up against Eric forecast of business week-to-week to week. It has been very successful, are originating on-time departures out of the LA basin are in the mid-90s and we feel very confident we can keep it there. Operator : Are next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Cleo Zagrean : My first question relates to the impact of mixed operating ratio. Can you please clarify for us whether you expect mix to be a headwind or tailwind, if a headwind is it mostly because of declines in coal and frac rather than international intermodal coming back? Thank you. Rob Knight : Cleo, the headwind that we would anticipate from the mix going forward is a result of, we expect strong intermodal and softer coal and fracking related activities, as you are calling out. But as always we're going to continue to focus on being as efficient as we can on the cost side. And as Eric has been talking all morning we're going to continue to price to the value proposition. So we're not throwing the towel in terms of the margins but we know we\u2019re going to face the headwind of those mix changes. Cleo Zagrean : And my second question relates to coal. Can you please discuss to what extent share shifts may have affected your volumes in a flat Western coal market in the first quarter? And your outlook for Colorado, Utah, with any kind of detail you want to share on the market for that coal and whether your long-term export outlook has changed? Thank you. Eric Butler : Yes, there were no material contractual share shifts that we saw. Lance Fritz : And what about Colorado Utah, Eric? Eric Butler : There were no material shifts. Cleo Zagrean : Okay, because we have seen been up like mid high single digits and your volumes down. So I was wondering whether those are related in any way, it's just totally separate tracks so to speak? Eric Butler : We can't speak to their business, naturally. We kind of describe the dynamics we saw in our business, it would not surprise me if they had a much greater opportunity for inventory replenishment for their customers in the first quarter than we had, simply because we had more deliveries last year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : I had one quick one on frac sand adjusting to the current outlook down mid-teens in the second quarter. But as opposed to something like coal where you have natural gas and inventories as you mentioned, a little bit of a leading indicator. With sand it's a little tougher as the amount of sand per well continues to go up and different basins move ahead at different rate. So do you have any sense of the visibility into the second half of the year either in what you're seeing in actual orders or talking to your customers directly what the programs might look like at this point? Thanks. Eric Butler : I'm not quite sure where does what you are asking but it would be basically be similar to what we kind of said before. Lance Fritz : Brian, were you asking for a crystal ball on frac sand in the second half of the year? Brian Ossenbeck : Yes call please. I was asking how you think about the second half of the year with frac sand? Eric Butler : I think our frac sand volumes based on current activity will probably be more similar to 2013 volumes than 2014 volumes. Operator : Our next comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Keith Schoonmaker : Knowing the strength in autos in the period, will you please comment on how your expectations for trades with Mexico compared with maybe somewhat tempered with overall growth rate? Lance Fritz : Let me jump in just on the very long-term and, Rob mentioned this early on in a comment about our franchise because we do serve all six rail gateways to Mexico and because of Mexico's opening up of some of their core industries, as well as the significant foreign direct investment from the very long-term perspective, we feel very, very good about our business and growth with Mexico. Eric Butler : I have nothing more to add with that. Mexico continues to be an upside for us. We have a great franchise and we're optimistic about the outlook. Keith Schoonmaker : Yes if Mexico does grow outsize compared to business in the U.S., would this be accretive? Lance Fritz : Not necessarily. With that question actually has been in fact what we have experienced with last decade, our volumes in and out of Mexico have grown at a slightly faster pace than the overall enterprise volumes. And I would not try to draw conclusion in terms of margin -- those moves. Keith Schoonmaker : Is it longer haul though? Lance Fritz : It can be, again, I would say overall scheme of things, it's no different than are overall enterprise mix. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. So you heard us talk about today was our first quarter where we came into the year, volumes changed on us dramatically and we've spent the quarter aggressively trying to write-size and just fell short of that mark. As we look forward into the second quarter, we're looking forward to continue that work and improve our service product and our efficiencies and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to happen. And we look forward to talking to you about it the next time we get together. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance Fritz : Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.38 per share for the second quarter of 2015. This is a 3% decrease in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains were not enough to overcome a significant decrease in demand. Total volumes in the second quarter were down 6%, led by a sharp decline in coal. Industrial products and agricultural products also posted significant volume decreases. As you recall, first quarter volumes were down 2%, and we began realigning our resources early in the year, storing locomotives and furloughing employees. These efforts continued throughout the second quarter. We've made meaningful progress right sizing our resources to current volumes, and I'm encouraged to report that we've made these improvements while posting strong safety performance. But, our work is not finished. We'll continue to become more agile with our network and our resources. We remain focused on providing safe and efficient service for our customers, and strong financial performance for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric Butler : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 6%, with gains in automotive and intermodal more than offset by declines in coal, industrial products and Ag products. We generated solid core pricing gains of 4%, but it was not enough to offset the drop in fuel surcharge and the mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 5% in the quarter. You'll see the impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue as we discuss each business group. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 10% decrease in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 7% on a 7% volume decrease in flat average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 19% in the quarter. Our domestic feed grain shipments declined 6% as we return to more normal seasonal shipping patterns compared to the strong demand last year. Export feed grain was impacted by the strong US dollar and abundant global grain supply, driving our export shipments down 36%. In wheat, our export shipments also declined, but were partially offset by moderately better domestic shipments. Grain products volume was down 3% for the quarter. Ethanol volume declined 6%, driven by extended plant maintenance downtime following a record year of production. Partially offsetting the ethanol decline was increased demand for soy bean meal exports to China and an increase in bio-diesel shipments. Food and refrigerator shipments were down 2%, driven primarily by fewer potato shipments and also due to lower frozen meat exports. Automotive revenue was up 3% in the second quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 3% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the second quarter, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2014. This is the first quarter with the SAAR rate above 17 million vehicles since the third quarter of 2005. In auto parts, volume grew 5% this quarter driven primarily by increased vehicle production. Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% reduction in average revenue per car and flat volume. Plastics shipments were up 11% in the second quarter. Stable resin pricing led to strong buyer confidence in the market, and we also saw a strength in export volume. Petroleum and liquid petroleum gas volume was up 10% in the second quarter, driven primarily by strength in several LPG markets. Our volume gains were offset by a 29% decline in crude oil shipments, which continued to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Coal revenue declined 31% in the second quarter on a 26% reduction in volume and 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 28% for the quarter, as demand for coal continued to be impacted by mild weather and lower natural gas prices. In addition to soft demand, volumes were also impacted by heavy rains in June that flooded coal mines in the Powder River Basin and damaged our main line. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 31% for the quarter, driven by both the soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. I'll talk more about our outlook for coal in just a minute. Industrial products revenue was down 14% on a 13% decline in value and 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Construction products revenue was down 5% for the quarter. We experienced higher than normal rainfall in the southern part of our franchise during the quarter, which led to construction delays that impacted both cement and rock volume. We still think the construction market is fundamentally strong, particularly in Texas, and that our construction products business will rebound. Minerals volume was down 24% in the second quarter. The reduction in drilling activity led to a 28% decline in shipments of Frac sand. Finally, metals volume was down 27% as lower crude oil prices reduced drilling related shipments by nearly 50%. Also, the strong US dollar continued to drive increased imports, which reduces demand from domestic steel producers. Intermodal revenue was down 5% as a 2% volume increase was more than offset by a 7% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments grew 3% in the second quarter, as we continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for premium services. International intermodal was up 1%, as our recovery from the west coast port labor dispute was muted by the strong comparisons from 2014. You'll recall that the second quarter 2014 results included free shipments ahead of the west coast port labor contract expiration. Additionally, we experienced a slowdown later in the quarter due to relatively high retail inventory levels and softer than expected retail sales. I'll update you on our expectations for peak season in just a minute. To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, overall crop conditions in our territory appear favorable at the moment. However, low commodity prices and abundant global supply creates uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In grain products, we expect demand for soybean meal to remain strong in the near term, and ethanol production should return to seasonally normal levels. Automotive should continue to benefit from strength in sales, and we expect growth in finished vehicles and auto parts shipments. In coal, while the weather has been closer to seasonally normal temperatures recently, we expect lower natural gas prices, higher inventories and low export demand to continue to be head winds in the second half of the year. Although we anticipate continued year-over-year declines in the back half of the year, we expect that volumes will sequentially improve from second quarter levels. Most chemical markets remain solid for the remainder of the year, with strength expected in LPG and plastics. We continue to expect crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will remain a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments for the rest of the year. Lower crude oil prices will also continue to impact some of our industrial products markets. Rig counts are down roughly 50% from their peak in 2014, but seem to have stabilized in recent weeks. We expect our Frac sand shipments to level off as well, though they will be significantly lower year-over-year, given the strong comps. The reduction in new drilling activity, along with the strong dollar, will continue to be head winds for our metals business. The housing market continues to strengthen year-over-year, and we believe our lumber franchise is well positioned to grow with demand. In construction products, we anticipate to return to growth as weather conditions normalize. Finally in intermodal, the relatively high current retail inventory levels could moderate our growth in the second half of the year in both domestic and international. However, many of the consumer confidence and spending indicators are still positive, so we're preparing for a normal peak shipping season, though it could be muted. As always, highway conversions will continue to present growth opportunities in domestic intermodal. Overall, while there is uncertainty in some of our markets, we continue to see opportunity in several others. We will continue our focus on solid core pricing gains and business development across our diverse franchise. With that I'll turn it over to Cameron. Cameron Scott : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our first half reportable injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low 0.82. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the work place is clearly having a positive impact, as we improve towards our goal of zero incidents. In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.46, driven by an increase in yard and industry reportable. To make improvement going forward, we will continue to focus on enhanced training to eliminate human factor incidents. We will also continue making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 11% versus 2014 to 1.97. We continue to drive improvement by reinforcing public awareness through channels including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. Moving to network performance, we continue to face a very dynamic environment. Significant volume swings and business mix shifts have led us to more frequently adjust our transportation plans. Add to it the numerous flooding related outages we faced during the quarter, and it was a challenging operating environment. During the quarter, we experienced 64 weather interruption days, caused by more than 100 weather-related track outages, including a significant interruption in the Powder River basin during early June. We define interruption days as more than 50 hours of train delay associated with weather or incident events. The strength of our franchise and investments we have made in resources and infrastructure have enabled us to mitigate the impact of these events. We rerouted trains where possible, while our engineering crews worked around the clock to restore operations. I'm very proud of the men and women of Union Pacific who faced these challenges head on, enabling us to generate year-over-year improvement in both velocity and terminal dwell. That said, we know there is more work to do and we're working diligently to improve service and reduce costs. Throughout the year, you have heard us discuss the importance of resource alignment as a key lever to reduce cost. While we strive to be as real-time as possible, the reality is that there is a time lag in adjusting the resource space, especially during periods of volume swings and business mix shifts. As you can see in the charts on the right, we have made meaningful progress right sizing our TE&Y workforce and active locomotive fleet throughout the first half. Our total TE&Y workforce was down 4% in June versus March. More than half of the decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. We expect a further reduction in the third quarter. By the end of June, we had around 1200 TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status, and had about 900 locomotives in storage. This is up from the end of the first quarter, when we had around 500 TE&Y employees furloughed or on alternative work status, and 475 locomotives in storage. While we still have some work left to do, we are now getting closer to having our resources aligned with demand. But as always, we'll continue to monitor and adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume dictates. Moving to network productivity. Even in the face of less than optimal operating conditions and lower volumes, we're able to generate some efficiencies during the quarter. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories, remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity despite a decline in the number of cars switched. Growth capacity investments whether it be in the form of sidings, double track, or terminal infrastructure have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have increased the fluid capabilities of our network. However, as was also the case in the prior quarter, the associated time lag in adjusting resources to lower volumes continue to lead to inefficiencies in other areas. This was particularly evident in efficiency metrics such as locomotive productivity, which is measured for gross ton miles per horsepower day. While lower coal and grain volumes did create a mix headwind, this suite productivity metric was down 8% versus the second quarter of 2014. To wrap up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding record results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue making operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our franchise to improve operational performance. While our resources are now more closely in line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to reduce costs. Ultimately, safety and service will drive our ability to run an efficient network, all of which creates value for our customers and increases returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks, good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.4 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A significant decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with a negative shift in business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.5 billion, decreasing 9% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense reduction where significantly lower fuel expense, along with volume-related reductions and cost-saving initiatives. The net result was an 11% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $142 million, up from $22 million in 2014. Included in this amount is the previously announced Fremont, California land sale, which contributed $113 million to pretax income or $0.08 per share to total earnings. Interest expense of $153 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased 7% to $734 million, driven primarily by reduced pretax earnings. Net income decreased 7% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.38 per share, down 3% versus last year. Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.1 billion was down 10% versus last year. In addition to a 6% volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $400 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of fuel price was a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. This includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. Of course this is a turnaround from the first quarter, where we had the benefit of surcharge lag and more favorable spreads. Assuming fuel prices and associated spreads remain at current levels, we estimate that fuel will be a slight headwind to earnings for the remainder of the year. Business mix, as we guided on our first quarter earnings call, was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the second quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in bulk grains, Frac sand, and steel shipments, along with an increase in intermodal volumes. Looking ahead, business mix will likely continue to be a headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 4% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. Core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 4% this quarter, just under a half percent can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals. Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 5% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense, and operating inefficiencies. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4% when compared to 2014. About half of this increase was in our capital-related workforce. Excluding our capital-related employees, our force level grew by about 2.5%, but is down 500 sequentially from the first quarter. As Cam just discussed, we are continuing to adjust our TE&Y workforce levels to better align with current demand. While we have made progress, we continue to look for every opportunity to right size our workforce and focus on labor productivity. By year end, we now expect our net overall workforce levels to come in somewhat lower than the 48,000 that we reported at the end of last year. Labor inflation was about 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Remember, the first two quarters of this year include the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year on top of the 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including slightly higher pension costs. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $541 million, down 41% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 10% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 2%, largely driven by the decline in coal volumes, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.99 per gallon. Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 6% to $600 million. Reduced contract service expenses associated with our subsidiaries was partially offset by an increase in locomotive material expenses. Depreciation expense was $497 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to increase about 6% for the full year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $312 million, which is down 1% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and freight car rental expense were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $225 million, down 1% versus last year. Lower personal injury expense was somewhat offset by higher state and local taxes. Year-to-date, other expense is up 7%, consistent with our full-year expectation of a 5% to 10% increase, excluding any large unusual items. Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the quarterly operating ratio came in at 64.1%, an increase of 0.6 points when compared to the second quarter of 2014. The operating ratio benefited just under a point from the net impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter. Turning now to our cash flow, cash from operations for the first half increased to just under $3.8 billion. This is up 17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and changes in working capital. We also invested more than $2.1 billion this half in cash capital investments. Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $16.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion at year end. This takes our adjusted debt to capital ratio to 44.2%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We continue to target an adjusted debt to cap ratio in the low-to-mid 40% range, and an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. We have made meaningful progress towards our targets as we continue to execute our cash allocation strategies. Our profitability and cash generation enable to us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to shareholders. Since the first of the year, we have bought back about 15 million shares totaling $1.6 billion. Between the first and second quarter dividends, along with our share repurchases, we returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2015. This represents roughly a 15% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value. So that's a recap of our second quarter results. As we look towards the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on achieving solid core pricing gains. However, we expect volumes to be down somewhat year over year in the second half, given the market dynamics we are experiencing in many of our business segments. Also, as we discussed earlier, business mix will continue to be a head wind on freight revenue. On the expense side, we noted on our first quarter earnings call that inefficiencies cost us as much as 2 points on the operating ratio. We've made good progress since then. We estimate that these extra costs added just under a point in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to reduce these costs even further. While we continue to improve, it is not likely at this point that we will achieve record earnings on a full year basis, given this year's challenges. Longer term, however, we expect to be on track to achieve our long term financial guidance. As always, we remain committed to providing our customers with safe, efficient service, and our shareholders with strong financial returns. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Rob. With the challenges of the first half now behind us, our focus is on the remainder of the year and beyond. Clearly, there are still a lot of moving parts. We'll keep a close eye on crude oil and natural gas prices, the upcoming grain harvest, the strong dollar impact on balance of trade, as well as the continued demand for autos and the outlook for the consumer economy. All of this leads to a fluid demand picture across many of our business segments. While the volume outlook is uncertain, we remain laser focused on operating safely and efficiently no matter what the market environment. We will continue to reduce costs and productivity as we further align resources with demand. While we've made some progress, there is more to be done. Longer term, we continue to be optimistic about the strengths of our diverse rail franchise. We remain committed to providing excellent service for our customers and strong returns to our shareholders in the years ahead. So with that, let's open up the lines for your questions. Rob Knight : Lance, if I can make one comment before we take the first question? Lance Fritz : Sure. Rob Knight : We just understand here recently that some of you have had trouble accessing the slides on our web site. They are back up and running now. So if you have any difficulty, we suggest you log out and log back in, and they should be up and available for you. We apologize for that. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : Good morning. I wanted to touch on, Rob, what you wrapped up there with. When you think about earnings progression as we go through the rest of the year, clearly we had the pinch point here in the second quarter with resources relative to volume. Volume gets better a little bit sequentially, and resources are still adjusting. Do you feel like getting back to year-over-year earnings growth is something that can be achieved by the fourth quarter of this year? I don't want to get too specific in terms of guidance, but I just want to get a rough sense of the puts and takes about trying to get back up to a positive trajectory and then thinking out into 2016? Rob Knight : We're focused on obviously improving earnings as best we can. You're exactly right, we're going to be laser focused on continuing to align the resources and be as efficient as we can on the costs. But what we're calling out in my comment to suggesting that it's not likely that we will beat last year's record earnings is the reality of what we're seeing in the business mix, particularly the coal volumes. We're not calling for any dramatic turnaround in our coal volumes. As Eric pointed out, while we are seeing some sequential improvement as we speak right now, we are anticipating that that will be a challenge. The other thing I would just point out Chris in the way you're looking at it, is recall last year actually is a very tough comp for the fourth quarter in particular. So we've got that headwind, if you will, in terms of getting back above that level. So we're focused on taking advantage of every opportunity we can, but we just see some continuing softness in some of our key markets, and that's going to be the key driver. Chris Wetherbee : That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on the coal that you mentioned there. As you see that sequential improvement into 3Q, any sense you can give us on how to think about that specific commodity group in the back half, or just maybe the third quarter? And maybe where stockpiles are, so we can get some rough sense there? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Eric, can you take care of that for us? Eric Butler : It all depends, Chris, as we always say, depending on weather. Inventory levels are still higher than the 5-year average. They have come down about three or four days. The burn is increasing, but they are still higher. The volumes will depend on whether; it will depend a lot on natural gas pricing. At current natural gas levels, it remains a difficult comparison for coal to remain coal. It's about a 30%, 32% market share today, versus the 39%, 40% last year. A big change in that is natural gas pricing. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions. Allison Landry : Thanks, good morning. So, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the mix head wind that you mentioned going forward. So based on some of your comments, if grain volumes do end up materializing, you do see a rebound in construction products and potentially some muted growth on the intermodal side. Is there a scenario where mix could be flattish? I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the puts and takes, and the magnitude of the negative mix in the back half. Lance Fritz : Rob, do you want to take that? Rob Knight : If what you just outlined, Allison, came true, those would certainly be positive contributors to the mix. As you know, I don't give guidance on mix. It's rare that we do. This year is unique in that we are confident that the mix head winds are in front of us. So we're giving that directional guidance. I would just remind everyone that, because of the great diversity of our business mix, which is a strong attribute of the Union Pacific franchise, we tend to have a lot of mix swings in our business from quarter to quarter. So the points that you are making would certainly contribute. Would they be enough to overcome some of the other head winds like the coal, the shale, the sand, et cetera? Perhaps not, but every opportunity we have to, you know, narrow the gap, if you will, and improve on the mix, we'll certainly take advantage of it. Lance Fritz : I'd like to add to that. This is Lance, our commercial team has a robust business development pipeline. They're pursuing business opportunity that presents itself to us because of our wonderful diverse franchise. So to Rob's point, it's hard to be precise in making a future call. There are opportunities and puts and takes. The guidance we've given you is what we think is our best guess. Allison Landry : Okay. Just a follow-up question. Could you give us a sense of how much the inefficiencies cost you in the second quarter? Rob Knight : Yes, Allison, just to rephrase that, remember we said it was up to about - call that $100 million in the first quarter. It was closer to just under a point in the second quarter. From a dollar standpoint, we'll call that a $50 million improvement, from first to second quarter in those efficiencies. Again, we're focused on continuing aggressively to remove those efficiencies as quickly as we can. Allison Landry : Sorry, I missed that last part. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe research. Please go ahead with your questions. Scott Group : Thanks, good morning. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Scott Group : Just want to clarify one quick thing first. Rob your comments about earnings growth, what are you assuming for the second quarter? Is that based on $1.30 or $1.38? Rob Knight : In the second quarter, $1.38. I guess what you are getting at is the land sale. Yes, all in. Scott Group : Okay. So a question on coal. We understand some of the pressures, but seeing so much more weakness in your volumes relative to BNSF, is there any color you can provide on - maybe there is a big market share loss or customer loss that we should be thinking about, and when that began? Are you starting to see any pressure from the utilities on a pricing standpoint? Lance Fritz : I'm going to let Eric answer that question. Eric Butler : As we mentioned at last quarter, Scott, we do think we came into this year a different place than our western competitor in terms of inventory levels of our key customer utilities, and we do think that that has had an impact. We also think, as we mentioned in our comments, that some of the flooding and track outages that we experienced particularly in June, had an impact that you probably won't see in the numbers of our western competitor. One of the other impacts that we have seen is that there are probably a couple of specific customers that have had outages, that have had challenges in their energy markets in terms of them competing that are probably disproportionately impacting us than our competitor. We think over time, that kind of works its way out. Certainly in the second quarter it had an impact. We always compete for business. We think we have a market value. We are continuing to focus on the strong price in terms of the second part of your question. You know, we feel good about the market value, and the price for our services, and that is reflected in our results in the second quarter. Scott Group : Thanks. The last question, I want to ask about share buybacks. It seems to me for the past several years, you have had this really unique story with the legacy pricing. That's behind us now, but it seems to me, you still have a unique opportunity in terms of having by far the least leverage of any of the rails. Given the weakness in the stock and maybe tougher to grow earnings. Do you start to think about using that optionality more aggressively? And why not? Rob Knight : Scott, you know the guidance we've given in terms of the metrics that we're comfortable with. To your point on the share buyback, if you look at the first half of this year compared to last year's first half, we're up about 10% in terms of our share buyback, and we will continue to be opportunistic, and at the prices that we're seeing right now, we think those are nice entry points. So we will - we are certainly, as we always have, buy more when it's down, less when it's up. Your longer term question, I think is answered in our comfort with our longer term metrics that we've given. Lance Fritz : Scott, this is Lance. I want to react to something that was in your question, which said tougher to grow earnings, going forward. I want to reemphasize what we've constantly focused on with our investors, and that is we've got an industry best franchise. It's got plenty of opportunity for a growth and business development. We've got plenty of opportunity to continue to improve the productivity and efficiency of operations. For the very long term, we feel very good about our long-term guidance. Scott Group : Thank you. Rob Knight : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Just a little follow-up on the coal just for a second. I want to go back to last quarter, you thought coal was going to be down 5%. At that point it was already running down in the mid-teens. I just want to think back to the inefficiencies, as you noted. Have you been slower to cut costs in addition to the inefficiencies? Lance, the question would be, what gets to you move quicker? Thinking about how to balance cutting costs and staying ahead of that, but then if you get that inflection on volumes at some point to still be prepared? How do you think about how quickly you want to cut out some of those additional costs? Lance Fritz : Sure. So Ken, putting this all in context, right? This time last year, second quarter last year, we were behind in resources, experiencing substantial growth, and as rapidly as we could, filling our pipeline with new employees. We came into this quarter or this year and then in the first quarter, as you note, declined 2%, which was not our expectation and then further declined in the second quarter. So as soon as we recognized this year that we need to make adjustments, we've been doing so. The big thing that has us mismatched right now is really two parts, and Rob hit both. One is our capital program and the type of capital we're spending is demanding that we have more capital head count. So there's a head count imbalance there that grew year-over-year, and our training pipeline where we were just filling it up in the second quarter last year, and we're now emptying it out in the second quarter this year. As we move into the third quarter, all of that is happening at a rapid pace and will continue to happen. I expect by the end of the third quarter, much more balance as regards to training and as regards overall head count and resources targeted on the transportation product. You know, answering your question, could we do things faster? Hindsight is a luxury we typically don't have in planning the business. I certainly wish we had better clarity in what our markets would be doing, what the mix would look like. We certainly would be making adjustments more rapidly if we did. However, in the pragmatic world we're in right now, there is an opportunity for us to be better. We're working very hard right now in trying to figure out ways to be more agile with our resources, to be quicker in recognizing market shifts and being quicker and being able to take those actions. So I think it's a fair question. Ken Hoexter : I appreciate that seems tough to see with some more volatility on the volume side. On the follow up, maybe just throwing it to Eric. On, I think the question before was talking about more on the coal side and the competition. If you are seeing that impacting pricing? It seems like with your positive 4% pure pricing. But I want to understand, are you seeing across the other commodities, as Burlington has improved their service levels, are you seeing increased competition on the volume side? And any thoughts on pricing and what that may do outside of your legacy renewals. Eric Butler : Ken, we always say we have a tough competitor. They always have been. Always will be. Not only is the Burlington a tough competitor, but we compete with other railroads and other markets. We also compete with trucks. Trucks are also a tough competitor, and lower fuel prices are helping them. That being said, we feel good about our value proposition we're continuing to focus on the strategies and initiatives to improve our value proposition. It's our goal to have the best service and value proposition in the industry. If we do that, we think we'll be able to price appropriately for our value. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the time and insight. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Brandon Oglenski : Rob, can I follow up on this line of questions, here? Just thinking about your OR or your margins in the back half of the year. I think if we look back the last couple of years, you've had quite a bit of sequential improvement and profitability. We're talking a lot of pluses and minuses here. Business mix should be negative, still lower volumes year on year, but sequentially improving. Still getting price. Then you talked a lot about the fuel impact in the second quarter and how that could be incremental headwind. You have wage inflation, but head count reduction. So as you balance all of this out, with the best view right now, how do you feel about the operating ratio heading into the second half of the year? Rob Knight : Yes. There's a lot of moving parts, as you point out. Fuel being a big one, in terms of the impact that that has on the operating ratio itself. But our focus would be that that is an opportunity still for to us make year-over-year improvement. The way things look at this point in time, fuel would probably help in that regard unless it dramatically changes and spikes up. We are focused on, for all of the efficiencies that we plan on taking, the continued focus on price, the diverse opportunities that still will present themselves. We are focused on still improving the operating ratio year-over-year. Brandon Oglenski : That's helpful. Eric, can you comment a little bit on grain markets? There is a big discussion that, if we have another big harvest or relatively large harvest, which I think the government is calling for right now, how much of that can we actually store if folks decide they don't want to sell into a lower commodity price environment? Or is there just not that much storage? Are we going to end up having to move the volume anyways? Eric Butler : The outlook right now is that the yields look strong. Still relatively early in the growing season, so anything could happen from a weather standpoint. Right now, the projections are, while it may not be a record crop like the last two years, it still will be a pretty strong corn and bean crop. As you suggest, storage of crops are relatively high because US grain has not been able to compete as effectively, because there have been strong world grain crops and the strong US dollar. So there is a speculation that says if it is a strong crop, there will have to have the current products or the crop move, and so that would be a positive for us in the second half of the year. You know, there's always uncertainty in our markets, but that is one of the scenarios that could be positive for the transportation system. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein research. David Vernon : Rob, with the weather events that we had this year being a lot worse than last year, is there any estimate for the costs that you may be incurred this quarter that wouldn't be there if weather would have been a little more favorable, or is that too hard to call? Rob Knight : I think it's just too hard to call, David, to be honest. It would be rolled up in those inefficiencies that I called out. David Vernon : From a mix perspective, the revenue tonne mile was - tonne miles were down 14% relative to the car load decline of mid-single digit. Where in the business, Eric, do you see the biggest negative mix on the length of haul right now? Eric Butler : As Rob said there's a lot of ins and outs in terms of mix, and we actually have had ins and outs in terms of mix across the business line. Coal certainly is a negative mix item, as you might imagine, but we have grown our intermodal business, which is a longer haul, so that would be positive. There's always lots of ins and outs. David Vernon : Is the fall off in Frac sand, for example - were those sort of longer length of haul than your average industrial product shipment? Eric Butler : Frac sand is right around the average length of haul for industrial products. Certainly the fall off from that has had a revenue mix impact, as Rob talked about. David Vernon : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz, with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. Tom Wadewitz : Good morning. I wanted to ask you about volumes in second half, and I know that, you know it's a directional question. I know it's hard to have tons of granularity on this stuff, but volumes are down 6% year-over-year in second quarter. I think the comparison's maybe just a touch easier in third. The way we should look at this is less worse year-over-year in third quarter. Is that a pretty reasonable assumption? When you look at fourth quarter, a little bit less worse? And how would you - any broad comments on just thinking about modeling volumes, year over year, third quarter and fourth quarter? Lance Fritz : Before I let Rob speak to it in perhaps more detail, the way we're thinking about volumes in the second half, and we said it is - We're expecting a normal seasonal pattern, so seasonally, we see a peak in the second half and the third quarter. But there's a lot of reason for to us think that it's a muted peak. So I think that's sequentially better, but there's head winds against the year-over-year. Rob? Rob Knight : I would just reiterate what we said earlier. And that is, we expect them to be down somewhat in the back half. We're not giving quarterly guidance on the volume, but the thing I would just point out is that I'd like to think that the sequential improvement that we're starting to see that Eric pointed out in coal will help in that third quarter year-over-year look. Then the fourth quarter is a little more of a challenge for us. So we're not calling it. But we're certainly focused and hopeful that things from a year-over-year perspective don't look like a 6% down kind of number, but we're not giving precise guidance on that. Tom Wadewitz : That's good. I appreciate the comments. Then the follow-up question, on the expenses. Obviously, there's a lag on some of these items, so I suppose training expense and maybe in some of your materials expense and some others. How would I look sequentially at some of these categories where you have seen improvement. You know, if I look at purchased services, you are down quite a bit sequentially. Is that down more in third quarter versus second? Another category, rents was kind of flat sequentially. Are some of those categories down more in absolute terms in third quarter versus second? Lance Fritz : Rob? Tom Wadewitz : Thank you. Rob Knight : This probably won't shock you, but you're going to stump me in terms of trying to get into individual expense categories. But I would just say that all of the categories are stones that we are uncovering and looking for opportunities. Labor, of course, shows up across the board, and that I would say, as a large position, is what we're really focused on. That might show up of course in multiple expense categories. As I pointed out, remember we took the $100 million of inefficiency or misalignment in the first quarter down to let's call it $50 million-ish in the second quarter, and we're focused on going after that $50 million, and then some. Our focus is to not just stop there, but continue to achieve as efficient of operations as we possibly can, matching against demand. So long answer to your short question, but would I say it's across the board that we are going to expect ourselves to make improvements. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors, with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for taking my question here. So clearly, there were a lot of volatility and low visibility in the second quarter relative to where you thought you were in earning the quarter from a demand perspective. I'm curious, now versus two or three months ago, what's your sense from your customers? Are they seeing more stability and low visibility? Is there any conviction that things have stabilized on top of the comments you made on coal earlier? Lance Fritz : Let me start with that, and then we'll get it to the expert in Eric. When you look at our top line, the story that we talked about in the first quarter really is the same in the second quarter, just more acute. That is there are areas of the economy that feel pretty stable and pretty good. It's reflected in the consumer side of the economy and specifically in things like our automotive shipments in the domestic intermodal product, a couple of things like that. This acute impact in the energy side of our business, specifically coal and shale energy-related product, is largely driving that top line problem. Eric? Eric Butler : That's right. I'm not sure there's much to add, but the economy feels pretty good. Most of the macroeconomic indicators are going in the right direction. You know them as well as I do, and we're seeing that in our business. The issue we have is a significant shortfall on coal driven by natural gas, mild weather, and some episodic issues with some large customers of ours. And, frankly, the falloff in our share-related business. But aside from that, the economic indicators and the economy - customers are feeling pretty good. Trend's already up the correct direction. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that. If I could just get one more in on the margin front. You mentioned that the headwinds from operational inefficiencies were about a point less in 2Q versus 1Q. But if I net out the impact of fuel surcharge, you'd have to go back quite a ways to see the net year-over-year margin decline as steep as you saw this quarter. As we try to directionally understand the drivers here. Can you rank order; mix, demand related, and simply a function of what the marketplace is giving you, versus you know, whether it's a timing lag between the shifts you've seen in the marketplace, and you have addressed the resource resizing already, to some extent? How significant is the net fuel headwind for the year that you alluded to in your prepared remarks earlier? Lance Fritz : So Rob, you want to take this one? Rob Knight : Let me try to answer that simply by saying they're all contributors, and they're all challenges that we deal with in our delay daily lives. But I would say, if you look at the second quarter, the biggest hit, if you would, would start with volume driven by coal. Second on the list is the mix impact, which obviously is impacted by the coal fall-off as well. But the mix impact of changing within our business mix, the sand, etcetera; the grains, etcetera, those would be the big drivers. Lance Fritz : What's part disappointing and part encouraging - and Cameron walked us through this. We had areas of real productivity improvement that our team drove, both the commercial and the operating team, from the standpoint of train size improvement to near record levels on almost every product. Continued improvement, and switching efficiency, and it was overwhelmed by this mismatch, this imbalance in resources. We're aggressively going after that, we'll get that right. Bascome Majors : Thanks for that color. I really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Clearly a lot going on in the volume aspect. I wanted to talk more about the regulatory front, where there's also a lot going on. I got two transportation spending bills in congress. When you look in the senate version, which may or may not make it, there's actually a whole lot of stuff about rail, PTC, hazardous materials, recording devices, etcetera. So with that and the recent challenge put on the - [Technical Difficulty] standards - if you could give us a high level view - [Technical Difficulty] it's always there; that's always something to look at and be cognizant of, but anything that you are especially focused on for the remainder of the 2015 into next year? Lance Fritz : Brian, you broke up a little bit when you were asking the detail of your question. Let me tell you what I think I heard and you tell me if that's right. You are asking, broadly, there's a lot going on in the regulatory environment, and what do we see coming out of that in the rest of the year and next year? Brian Ossenbeck : Yes that's good. Thanks. Lance Fritz : Okay. Our first primary focus in Washington is an extension on positive train control, or PTC. We've been crystal clear with our regulators and elected officials that we need that, that Union Pacific is not going to make the deadline. There is really no railroad that will make that deadline. The industry needs an extension. I believe everybody understands that. It looks like there's an opportunity to have that happen as maybe part of a highway bill or some other vehicle. The hard part of that is we've got to start making plans in case a PTC extension does not occur. And we'll then have to start communicating to our affected customers and commuter agencies what those plans are and what the timing is. That probably starts up sometime in September. There is a bit of a clock ticking on that. The second thing we're focused on intently is HAZMAT regulation, as you pointed out. We are in that dialogue. We think the regulation as published by the DOT has a couple of flaws. More broadly, we're very supportive of a new tank car standard. We've been asking for it, both as a company and as an industry for years. We are working diligently to get that standard right, to make it more safe than it currently is. The last thing we're working pretty hard on is different issues in front of the STB which is our commercial regulator. We're active in that dialogue, and trying to navigate that for the best of our company. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks. That was a good overview. Hopefully I've found a better spot for cell signal for the quick follow-up. I was wondering with all of the stuff going on with coal, as you look into next year, anything - this is another regulatory question, with the Mets ruling being kicked down to the circuit court by the Supreme Court a couple of weeks ago. Do you think that - one, every really had any impact in your service area. And two, if it did, you see any potential benefit from that rule being thrown back for reconsideration. Lance Fritz : I'm going to let Eric answer that specific question on coal emissions regulation. I'll just start with a broad statement. We believe coal needs to continue to be a robust part of electricity generation in the United States. It's low cost, it's abundant, and it can be clean in terms of its emissions. That's very important for the US economy and for the US manufactures to be competitive on a global scale. Eric? Eric Butler : In terms of the specific question, we don't think that the - while we applaud the ruling, we don't think it's going to have a significant impact. Either entities were already planning for it and/or they might still plan for it just because they don't know what might happen on the inevitable appeal that will occur. Or it wasn't going to have a significant issue anyway. So the fact that it was remanded, I don't think is going to have a significant impact one way or the other. Brian Ossenbeck : Alright, Lance and Eric, thank you for your time. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Bill Greene : Hi, good morning. Lance and Rob, I want to just explore a little bit the relationship between OR and the coal franchise. As you know, a lot of investors think of coal as being highly profitable. If coal weren't to come back, or even to go down further from here - in a longer term sense, like a secular decline, does it impede your ability to achieve your long term OR? Or do you feel like productivity and price alone can allow you to achieve that, even if the coal franchise ends up much smaller than it is today? Lance Fritz : I'll let Rob answer more specifically. I'll give you an overarching reaction, and that is, there are lots of puts and takes in our business, over the long term. Our franchise is such that we've always been able to find growth opportunities and take advantage of them, and I'll remind you that our overall business strategy is predicated on an industry best - a demonstrably better service product and pricing for that value. Along with productivity, all of that tells me I am confident in our long-term OR guidance. Rob? Rob Knight : I would reiterate what you just said. First of all, we're not calling for the death of coal as a business unit for us. We're experiencing a bit of a hiccup here. But I would say first of all, obviously that size of a business is a positive contributor to our OR. As it shrinks or any business shrinks, we have, as we've talked and as you know, we have a lot of diverse opportunities in front of us that give us a lot of confidence. That's what keeps us as confident as ever that we could still meet our long-term OR guidance. If we were to see it take a step down, any business unit take a step down, we would have to do the things that we have done over the last decade. That is right size our organization and make sure we are being smart about adjusting our costs accordingly so that we can continue to make progress on our financial results. Bill Greene : Okay, fair enough. A follow-up question is on the dollar. A lot of investors sort of ask me about whether rails were really sort of pseudo commodity plays, and a weak dollar effectively caused a lot of stuff in North America to move, not just sort of by rail, but a broader industrial implication. So do you feel like a strong dollar impedes your ability to get the car loads back to let's say over $180,000 a week? Is this sort of a real risk factor that we need to keep in mind when we think about longer term volumes? Eric Butler : I don't think so. You know, certainly as you know, when you have strong currency moves one way or the other, it could affect commodity flows. We see that in all of our commodity markets. But long term, North America is still kind of a strong, productive, secure, relatively low cost place of production. It's also a huge consumption market. Those things will continue to drive us being in the sweet spot for our transportation services, whether it's export or import. Long term, it doesn't move the needle. Bill Greene : Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is with Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Rob Salmon : If I could shift it back to the core pricing, I was a little bit surprised that it actually was stable, sequentially, at that up 4% with half a point coming from the legacy, with weaker coal volumes. Robert, could you talk more about what drove that? I would have thought with less coal, it would have been a head wind to core pricing. So any additional color, if it's coming from the 2016 renewal that you got a little bit more of a benefit this quarter, and you are just getting stronger pricing across the franchise? Lance Fritz : I'm going to throw it to Eric, but I'm very proud of the team for their results in the second quarter and a very difficult environment. The effectively priced for the value of the product, and that was a good outcome. Eric Butler : Rob can talk about the legacy impact. But, we are doing what we said. We have a value product, and we're pricing for it. Rob Knight : Specifically to the legacy question, I would say that was comparable to what we saw in the first quarter, where we said about a half point of the four was legacy, roughly. But you are also pointing out, and again, I'm as confident as Lance and Eric, and pleased with that performance. I think it shows that we're getting value in the marketplace. As you are also pointing out, and just to reiterate for others, the way we calculate our core price is if it doesn't move, we don't count it. We're hopeful that if and when coal resumes, some of the volume pick up, that some of those repriced contracts will be positive contributors to our margins as we move forward. Rob Salmon : Rob, can you give us a sense, had coal either been flat or the decline in line with Q1 in terms of overall car loads, what core pricing would have looked like, this past quarter? Rob Knight : I really can't give you that size. And there's a big mix even within the coal line. I'm not giving that level of specificity, but suffice it to say there was some value left there by not moving it. Rob Salmon : Fair enough. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the intermodal franchise. Can you focus on, going forward, just how much you think the competition has increased from the truckload side, as some capacity has crept back into the marketplace? And also longer term, given the issues that the west coast ports have had, do you feel there's a chance that the west coast could lose some permanent market share to the east coast? Eric Butler : Jason, in terms of the first question, clearly lower fuel prices will incrementally, nominally make truckers more competitive, and clearly as the shale play has gone down, there appears to be what we think is a temporary alleviation with some of the driver shortages or a temporary reduction, I should say. There still are long-term driver shortages out there, but some of the move of labor from that to truck drivers has alleviated some of the shortage. So trucks continue to be a competitive option. I would point out in the second quarter, we set, again, another all-time domestic intermodal record. Our volumes set another record. We continue to see huge conversion opportunities, and we think as we have the service, value proposition, we'll continue to be able to penetrate and take advantage of that. In terms of the west coast port, clearly that had an impact. Certainly in the first quarter and the second quarter, as some of the backlogs were cleaned up, that had a positive impact. But as we said, we had a tough comp year-over-year because of the free shipping that occurred the previous year. I think one of the things that are instructive is kind of the spread rates, the ocean spread rates between east coast and west coast. The east coast ocean rates have actually increased about $250 on a spot basis over the last couple of months, which basically is making the west coast ports even more competitive than what they were before the strikes. So we think that there's some risk that there might be some nominal temporary rerouting as a supply chain risk management approach. I think there's some surveys out there that says companies might move 5% of the supply chain, risk management. We're not really seeing that, and we still think the west coast ports have an economic and a time value for product going pretty deep into the east. Jason Seidl : Thank you for the details. For a follow up, Rob, maybe this is for you. Looking at all of the puts and takes in 2Q and looking forward, barring any other volume, unexpected volume shocks, do you view 2Q as sort of the low water mark for your margins? Rob Knight : There's a lot of moving parts. I would answer that by saying we're focused on making that statement true. Of course we're going to go after, and we are making progress as we pointed out, the inefficiency misalignment, but what we'll have to wait and see is exactly how the volumes play out, and all those variables and what fuel does, et cetera. But, I'd like to believe that that statement will become true. Jason Seidl : Okay, fair enough. Gentlemen, thank you for your time as always. Operator : Our next question is from Tom Kim, with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Kim : With regard to domestic coal, were you impacted at all by coal fire utility plant retirements in the second quarter? Then also, if Nat gases remain stable, would you expect any further coal-to-gas switching for the second half of the year? Eric Butler : There's no impact from coal plant retirements. There's still significant surplus capacity. Both coal and other sources. So there was no impact on the retirement. We do not expect significant incremental switching. I think all of that can switch is switching, given current natural gas pricing. Tom Kim : That's helpful. Then just on the intermodal yields. Can you talk about what drove the sequential Q-and-Q and then year-on-year deterioration in your average intermodal ARPU's? Lance Fritz : ARC. Intermodal ARC. Tom Kim : Yes. Eric Butler : As for all of our businesses in the second quarter, the ARC was really dominated by the fuel surcharge reduction. Rob Knight : I would also say, Tom, and mix - mix within each commodity group can also show up in there. There was no other marquee driver of that change. Tom Kim : Okay. So no change of length of haul, or anything like that. Just mostly that surcharge part. Eric Butler : Right. Tom Kim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Justin Long : With your coal volumes down substantially right now, I was curious, does that change your approach to pricing in your non-coal businesses? In other words, do you have the thought process that non-coal pricing now needs to move higher to maintain the return profile of the consolidated business, or do you view the pricing dynamics between coal and non-coal completely separately? Lance Fritz : I'm going to let Eric answer in more detail but our team prices every single move on the value of that move to the customer. Eric? Eric Butler : Nothing else, that's it. Justin Long : As a follow up, as we look into next year, if coal does continue to weaken and you are losing that high margin business, how are you thinking about where CapEx as a percentage of revenue needs to go in order to maintain or improve the current return profile of the business? Rob Knight : This is Rob. As you know, the long-term guidance that we've given on our capital spending is in that 16% to 17% of revenue, and we're not calling for the fall off or significant further declination in coal. But, if it did, we would - as we always do with our costs, we would right size. I would also just point out, your question reminds me that, given what we're seeing this year, we expect that metric of capital spending versus revenue to be a little bit higher this year, given what we're seeing in this fall off. But if you look longer term, we would right size the organization both from an OE and from a capital standpoint. But, that's not the guidance I'm giving, because that's not where we are at this point in time. But we would take those steps. Lance Fritz : Something else to keep in mind, Justin, is we've got plenty of capital capacity already built for the coal network. It's not really driving CapEx today. Justin Long : Thanks. Appreciate the time today. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham research group. Please go ahead with your questions. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. You know, a lot of my questions have been asked, but let me come back to the capital question. Just given the realignment of resources, how are your capital priorities changing, ex-PTC? Lance Fritz : Ex-PTC, we do our capital planning in a similar fashion year after year after year. We take a long term view of what we think markets are going to look like; we see how that lays in the existing network; we find where the hot spots exist from the standpoint of line of road constraint or terminal constraint, and then we target capital on that. There is a little bit of capital that gets spent on things like a specific project or a specific piece of business development, and then of course, there is a very large piece of capital that gets spent on consuming the existing network and maintaining it. And of course, that's driven by volumes and consumption. Cameron, is there - what else do you want to add to that? Cameron Scott : I think you covered it all, Lance. Our focus continues to be on the southern region with a lot of our capacity CapEx. That's being driven by Eric's forecast. Jeff Kauffman : Alright. A little follow-up to that. An unusual outage on the I-10 freight corridor, with the rains in Southern California. Is this an opportunity for the intermodal franchise? Is this forcing a lot of trucking capacity from LA to Phoenix to find alternatives? Eric Butler : That is one of our franchise corridors, as you know. It has been. We've invested in that corridor over time. We are growing, and will continue to grow. The temporary flooding that is happening out there because of the rains - As you know, trucks always have lots of ways to reroute. So there would be no significant incremental impact due to that. That is an area and a market that we're going after with our franchise. We have and we'll continue. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Thanks so much. Eric Butler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne, with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much, and good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. I was just curious, in terms of the resource imbalance, can you just give a bit of color as to how much of that is head count, and how much is locomotives and other equipment? Lance Fritz : Yes, so, we are balancing locomotives real-time to match the transportation plan, which matches what demand is telling us. So local motives from a storage count are very close to being about the right size. Right now, we have something like 900 locomotives in storage. The head count issue, again, is a little bit part capital, which is all about whatever our capital plan is, and part we have too many in the training pipeline, and too many kind of coming out of the training pipeline. That furlough count, which, I think we said was about 1200 at the end of the quarter. You know, depending on what happens with attrition and demand, that will continue to ebb and flow. Right now, it's growing. So we can make the fungible side of headcount, the individuals that are actually working and productive match real-time. It's the mechanism to get qualified trained employees that are taking us a little bit more time to get right. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, that's helpful. That's all for me, thank you. Eric Butler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions. John Larkin : Thanks, gentlemen, for taking my question. I wanted to bore into intermodal a little bit more, one of your shining stars in the quarter, volume wise. The truckload carriers on the contract side of their business, at least, are getting in quite a few cases 6%, 6.5% yield improvement, and anecdotally, I've heard from a number of mostly privately held IMC's that you all are putting in some pretty aggressive price actions also, that would in theory still maintain that cost advantage, vis-a-vis, truckload. The pricing is obscured by that fuel surcharge that Eric talked about a minute ago, which depresses the ARC. Can you talk a little bit about whether this is one of your strong initiatives on pricing, and whether you are really getting a lot of follow through with that, or pushback from customers and whether that has moved the profitability of intermodal so that it is on par with the other commodity groups? Eric Butler : No customer ever wants to take a price increase. They are always very tough discussions. We are taking market price increases across our book of business, every segment of our business, based on our value proposition. And we're going to continue to do that. John Larkin : Are the price increases in the vicinity of what the truckload carriers are getting, or are you not going to share that with us? Eric Butler : We reported the 4% core price increase, and we're focused on getting appropriate price increases. Rob Knight : You know we don't break it out by individual commodity group, but as Eric and the team - they are laser focused on improving the profitability in the intermodal group, as they are across the board. We're going to continue to do that. John Larkin : As a follow on, can you talk a little about intermodal service, which had a lot of hiccups in 2014 due to weather congestion in Chicago, growth in the new energy markets, at least. How is intermodal service tracking this year, and when would you expect it to be back at, say, 2012 or early 2013 levels? Once it reaches that level, do you think there's some latent demand out there that will come back onto the railroad once you have more of a truckload-like service product. Cameron Scott : Our first OS - that's our on-time origin departure for intermodal product, continues to increase. We're not quite back to 2013 or 2012 levels, but we're making very good progress. Particularly in Los Angeles and in Chicago. Over the road performance, we're still looking, as you can tell by our AAR velocity metric. We're still looking for a mile an hour. We're properly resourced, we've got great initiatives to go find that mile an hour and deliver it. We just don't have a stake in the ground as to when that will be achieved. We expect to make that improvement throughout the course of the year. Eric Butler : I would say, our goal was to be the best. So, we're clearly not satisfied with where our service is, and we're going to focus where Cam and his team, my team, we're working on. How do we improve the overall customer experience? And it's an intense focus, and I think as we go into the future, our goal is continuous improvement to improve what we take to the market. John Larkin : Thanks very much. Eric Butler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Troy : Just given the time of year typically from an accounting perspective, people revisit incentive comp and stock based accruals in second and fourth quarter. I was wondering, on a run rate basis, was that a help during the quarter, as we've seen at other railroads, as everyone struggled with the lower volume environment and stock prices, which have declined. If not, when might we expect, in light of the guidance for the lack of earnings growth this year, that that might flow through and help the comp line? I just want to make sure we avoid some of the lumpiness we've seen in other railroads. Rob Knight : I would say that it's a little bit in the second quarter. I'm not calling out or guiding that you are going to see anything lumpy in our numbers. I would say there was a little bit of an impact that showed up actually in our second quarter. Matt Troy : The second piece would be to revisit it in the fourth quarter? Is that typically how it runs? Or how does it go? Rob Knight : Yes, we always look at - each quarter, we look at what is the performance? So we'll stay tuned in terms of what impact that has in the back half. I don't envision it being lumpy, as you are citing. Matt Troy : Okay. And my follow-up - thank you for that, Rob. In light of the $0.01 rally in natural gas today, could you just refresh us, in terms of the switching friction or switching capability of your utility customers? Obviously there's not a singular point or price in Nat gas, let's say, $3.50, where everyone just cuts back. It's more gradated than that. Just wondering if we buck the consensus that gas is going to stay low, and vision or dream that one day gas prices might start to march north? Could you just help us understand what is the band at which people begin to contemplate going back to coal, and where coal might take some share back on the grid, relative to your customer base? Eric Butler : Matt, as you say it is a wide continuum. There are probably utilities that Coal looks favorable as low as $3, some $3.50, some $4. It is a wide continuum. Operator : Our next question is from Cleo Zagrean, with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning and thank you. I will follow up on prior questions in terms of pricing for coal and intermodal. Could you help us explain if maybe fuel is a better headwind such that, overall in terms of coal price, performance was close to the average of 4% for the company? Any insight you could help us with would be appreciated. Rob Knight : This is Rob. Let me reiterate that we don't break it out, what pricing we're actually getting within each commodity group. But I would just point out that, to your point on the impact that fuel might have had, we have some 60-plus different fuel surcharge mechanisms. So they do vary from group to group, and the timing of those can be different, and can impact from quarter to quarter what the recorded ARC number looks at. Again, our overall pricing success was 4% core price. We're confident that we're doing all of the right things in all of the commodity groups to improve that. Cleo Zagrean : Okay. Then my follow-up relates to the outlook for coal and your network, longer term. You were saying that it's tough to adjust the network from one quarter to the next, understandably so. But, are you seeing any significant challenges to coal volumes from upcoming gas capacities in 2017, 2018? And since you would have time to prepare for that, how can you adjust the networks to mitigate that potential negative impact? And you are saying also the diversity of the franchise allows for your long-term goals to be maintained. What would be the one main positive offset to a decline? So a continued secular decline in coal? Thank you. Eric Butler : As we said before, the big factors for coal, again, will be the cost of natural gas and weather. Today, there is surplus capacity on coal; there's surplus capacity on natural gas, today. The capacity isn't really as much as a driver as it is the point at which one dispatches versus another. It's different for different utilities. Again, I think $3 to $4 depending on utilities is probably the range that most utilities see today. Cleo Zagrean : Okay. So you're not seeing the need to significantly adjust resources longer term on account of what you see in coal? Lance Fritz : We are adjusting our resources constantly to match both what near-term demand looks like and what we think long-term demand looks like. We'll make those adjustments as the marketplace dictates. Cleo Zagrean : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Ben Hartford, with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Hartford : Thanks. Quick question, Eric. If I look within industrial products and the 35% of the volume that is construction, what is the split between res and non-res construction within that? Do you know? Eric Butler : Yes, so I don't have it, in terms of the overall construction number. If you want to just split out lumber, historically, lumber was two-thirds, one-third. Right now, it's probably closer to half to half. But again, housing starts are improving sequentially. The housing start number for June just came up that was significantly improved, I think 10% improved over the previous month. There's still more multi-family than single family, but the split here recently has probably been more 60%-40% versus 65%-35% or 55%-45%. Ben Hartford : So if I look at the 5% volume contraction within construction, can you help me rectify that in the context of some of the improvement that we have seen, as it relates to housing starts recently? Eric Butler : As I said in my prepared comments, the majority of that was in our rock and our cement, most of which goes on the commercial side. That was really weather-related. The demand is really, really strong. We're seeing that sequentially here, even in the recent weeks. The second quarter there were some heavy rains that impacted the volumes that we saw. Ben Hartford : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions. John Barnes : Hey, on the resource side, is there anything in the labor contracts that prevents you from right sizing the labor force faster or more aggressively than what you've done already? And are there any prohibitions about shifting that labor around to spots where it might be in more need? Lance Fritz : So I'm going to start and then I'll pass it to Cam. The short answer is, not really. Our collective bargaining agreements dictate things like rates of pay, what exactly the work needs to look like. Some work environment issues. Typically doesn't have much headwind to us when it comes to right sizing. When we talk about, again, having the training pipeline fatter, if you will, than it was second quarter last year, that's about us making decisions about continuing to train, because we will graduate them into work either immediately or in the near term, and it would be just more disruptive and more costly to take them out of training, and then start over again from scratch two or three or four months from now. Cam? Cameron Scott : I think you answered that perfectly. There is great flexibility, to answer your second question, on flexing appropriate resources to the network as required. So no issue, there. John Barnes : To go back to the intermodal question earlier. If I go back to my notes on your last analyst meeting, you were already talking about the potential for a couple of more percentage points of market share movement from the west coast to the east coast. I understand what you are saying about ocean shipping rates and that kind of thing, but the ILA is already out talking about doing a ten-year labor deal in order to provide, you know, labor certainty to the east coast ports, where the west coast laborer contract is a year shorter, still leaves some very large issues like the Cadillac tax out there, left unnegotiated as of yet. Is there any concern that the severity of the downturn this last time has more permanently impaired the west coast ability to attract that volume back, and is some of that volume shift we've seen more permanent than maybe you would originally have expected it to be? Eric Butler : Yes, so it's always a concern. It's in our franchise interest to have the proportion of business go through the west coast. So that's always something we look at. At the end of the day, we do believe economics win out, and today and we believe in the future, unless there's some substantial change, a difference between east coast, west coast. Today, the west coast option is the economically better option to go deep into the east. We've historically said that the Appalachian mountain chain was a crossover point. Things west of that, typically it's clear. The west coast is a better economic option. Things east of that, the east coast is a better competitor. You know, we'll always look at that. We do not believe anything substantial or significant has changed economically from the historical equation. There may be some minor adjustments for supply chain risk management issues in the short term, but we're not seeing anything significant or sustainable. John Barnes : Okay. All right. Just a follow up on that. If there's any pressure on your international intermodal volumes, are you in a position to more aggressively grow the domestic intermodal piece as a means of offsetting any of that weakness? Thanks for your time. Eric Butler : I'm not sure I would connect the two. The domestic market is where we have been growing. I mean, if you look at it, the international market has been - has had a much smaller slope. The domestic market shares huge truck conversion. You're still going to have a huge investment needed for highways. You can talk about we're not really investing in the highway trust fund. You can talk to getting agreement. You can talk about the driver shortages. You can talk about the economic and the environmental benefit of intermodal versus over-the-road trucks. It's a story that we've been talking about for the last half dozen years. We still think that there's a growth opportunity story, there, on the domestic intermodal side. Again, the second quarter was an all-time record for us on the domestic intermodal side. We think that on a volume basis, we think that there is still opportunities. John Barnes : Okay. Thanks for your time. Eric Butler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker, with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your questions. Keith Schoonmaker : I'd like to ask about a sector I believe there is a little more cause for optimism. And Chemicals are material high ARC segments in the franchise. Excluding crude, I think some classes of chemical carloads do nicely, maybe even double digits in the period. So while natural gas hurts coal, but could you look a little further out, comment on the flip side of cheap natural gas and share some of your expectations for chemical product manufacturing development? Eric Butler : We've talked in the past, and continue to talk about the huge plastic expansion that we're going to see in this country with the low natural gas prices. We think that you are going to see it even with natural gas going up to as much as $5 - $4.50, $5, we think that's still the sweet spot for the expansion that's happening in the Gulf. We have a great franchise. It's a franchise strength of ours to take advantage of it. There's billion, multi-billion dollars of investments going on. And, I think we've said publicly that we think we'll see the benefit of a lot of that starting in 2017 and 2018. But we think that is a franchise strength of ours. Keith Schoonmaker : I'd like to ask a question about operations, on the subject of right-sizing the locomotive fleet. Could you discuss how you think about the value of removing one locomotive from the fleet? Are most of these removed assets going to surge capacity storage rather than being sold or divested, or do they show up in lower lease expense? So just the value of removing a single locomotive, please? Rob Knight : This is Rob. Let me jump in. If Cam wants to add, he certainly can. Keith, I'm not going to break that out, but I would just say that, of course, when we get a new locomotive and we have an opportunity to put another locomotive in storage, or just through efficient operations we have an opportunity to put a unit in storage, we're putting the least efficient of the fleet in. We're always looking at - are there opportunities? For the most part, those go into our storage, and they are there, available for surge. Where there are opportunities for us to discontinue an existing lease or something, we'll do that, but that's not a big driver at this point in time. I think it's safe to assume that, as we free up a locomotive, it's going to be our least efficient from a fuel standpoint, from a maintenance standpoint, and from a DPU standpoint, that goes into that surge category. Cameron Scott : There's an aggregate benefit, that the fewer locomotives we have active in the fleet, the less maintenance we have to do, in aggregate. Keith Schoonmaker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you all for your questions and your interest in Union Pacific today. We look forward to talking with you again in October. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Baird Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research Don Brown - Avondale Partners Operator : Greetings and welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.50 per share, which is down 2% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Total volumes decreased about 6% in the quarter, more than offsetting another quarter of solid core pricing gains. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups with coal down the most at 15%. Automotive was the one commodity group with a year-over-year increase in the quarter with carloads up 5% versus 2014. On the cost side, we made significant progress aligning our resources to current demand. And I am pleased to report a quarterly record operating ratio of 60.3%. Going forward we will be intently focused on generating further productivity improvements. In addition, developing new business remains an important part of our strategy, whether we grow existing markets, develop new business with existing customers or find new market opportunities our commercial team is constantly filling the business development pipeline. I'm encouraged with the progress we have made as the men and women of Union Pacific worked tirelessly and safely to serve our customers and deliver value to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric Butler : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6.5%, with gains in automotive more than offset by declines in the other business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, but it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 4% in the quarter. Overall, the declines in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 10% reduction in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 4% on a 3% volume reduction and a 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 11% in the third quarter. The strong US dollar and high worldwide inventories reduced grain exports by 32%. Slightly stronger domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products volume increased 1% for the quarter. July and August saw the largest domestic soybean meal crush on record, resulting in a 17% increase in soybean meal shipments. Partially offsetting this was a 4% decline in ethanol shipments driven by strong 2014 comps of higher production and shipments. Food and refrigerator product volumes were flat for the quarter as strength in import sugar and barley were offset by declines in frozen meat and potato shipments. Automotive revenue was flat in the third quarter as a 5% increase in volume was offset by a 5% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 5% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.8 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 6% from last year. In auto parts, volume grew 5% driven primarily by increased vehicle production. Chemicals revenue was down 6% for the quarter on a 3% reduction in both volume and average revenue per car. We continue to see strength in plastics shipments, which were up 7% in the third quarter due to stable resin pricing and strong export volume. However, our volume gains were more than offset by declines in shipments of both fertilizer and crude oil. Lower grain commodity prices and market uncertainty resulted in farmers delaying fertilizer purchases. This resulted in a 10% decline in our fertilizer volume. Crude oil volume, which was down 40% in the quarter continues to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Coal revenue declined 18% in the third quarter on a 15% volume decline and 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 12% in the quarter. Low natural gas prices continue to put downward pressure on coal demand as coal share of electricity generation declined from 38% in the third quarter of last year to 35% this year. Coal inventories, which are currently 20 days above the five-year average contributed to the sluggish demand. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 32%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Industrial products revenue was down 16% on a 12% decline in volume and 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Our reduction in shale drilling resulted in a 31% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 36% decrease in frac sand car loadings.  Metals volume was down 26% as lower crude oil prices suppressed drilling related shipments and the strong US dollar drove increased imports. Demand for construction products resulted in a 1% volume increase in the third quarter, driven by continued demand in road and construction projects in our Texas [Rock] region. Intermodal revenue was down 11% in the third quarter on a 4% lower volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal volume was up 1% in the third quarter. Even though retail sales were down slightly year-over-year, we still achieved a best ever third quarter of domestic intermodal volume. International intermodal volume was down 9% in the quarter as compared to a strong third quarter of 2014, when cargo owners advanced peak season shipments in anticipation of port labor strikes. With relatively high inventories some international intermodal customers have reduced orders and not all east coast diversions have migrated back to the West Coast. I will update you on peak season in just a minute. To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, although we have had another strong crop year, low commodity prices and abundant global supply created uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In food and refrigerator, we expect continued strength in beer, but we are facing headwinds in other markets from increased truck availability year-over-year. We expect automotive sales to remain strong for the rest of the year, driving growth in finished vehicles and part shipments. We continue to expect coal demand to remain below year ago levels due to low natural gas prices, higher than average coal inventories and headwinds in the export coal market. As always, a key factor in demand will be weather conditions. Most chemical markets should remain steady for the remainder of the year, with strength expected in LPG. We continue to expect that weak oil prices, reduced production, and unfavorable spreads will remain a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments. In industrial products, lower crude oil prices will also continue to challenge our minerals and metals volume through the rest of 2015. While the housing market is slowly strengthening, the strong dollar and relatively weak China lumber import market are driving more imports of Canadian lumber to the US. We continue to expect demand for construction products to remain strong particularly in the southern part of our franchise. Finally in intermodal, we continue to see highway conversions and we expect this to be the seventh consecutive year of record domestic intermodal volumes. We expect that relatively soft retail sales will cause headwinds in our international intermodal volumes.  Overall, we will continue to focus on solid core pricing gains, strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business across our diverse franchise. With that I'll turn it over to Cameron. Cameron Scott : Thank you Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rates improved 12% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.92.  While we continue to make significant improvements, we won\u2019t be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0% incidents, getting everyone of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.56, driven by an increase in yard and industry reportables. While our reportable rate has taken a step back this year, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will put us back on a path of long-term improvement. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased slightly versus 2014 to 2.25. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through channels including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. Moving onto network performance, our operating metrics showed a step function improvement in the third quarter with net work velocity reaching levels not achieved since 2013. While weather conditions in the quarter were more favorable from an operating standpoint, year-over-year volume swings and business mix shifts continue to create a dynamic operating environment. However, the men and women at Union Pacific proved up to the challenge, diligently leveraging the strength of our franchise that serve our customers proudly. In regards to service, one of the key metrics we use to track our performance is our service delivery index. The measure, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments improved 8% versus the third quarter of last year. We also generated improvement in our local service product to customers with a 95.3% industry [Indiscernible], which measures the delivery or [polling] of a car to or from a customer. Though we know there is still more work to do and we are working hard everyday to further improve service and reduce cost.  Adjusting resources to current demand continued to be a key focus area for us in the third quarter. While we noted back in July that we had our locomotive fleet close to being right sized, we have made meaningful progress adjusting our TE&Y workforce over the past couple of months. By the end of September we had around 2700 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status, compared with 1200 at the end of the second quarter. In addition to adjusting the lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer [Indiscernible] resource demands of our network. Overall, our total  TE&Y workforce was down 10% in September versus June. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet is down 140 units from the end of the second quarter. As we currently sit, we still have some work left to do when our resources at the end of the third quarter were more closely aligned with current demand. While resource alignment has been a key focus throughout the year, we have not lost sight of other initiatives, which also drive productivity. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories, remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with 4% decline in the number of cars switched. Growth capacity investments, alongside process improvements, have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have increased the fluid capabilities of our networks. In addition, our progress in adjusting resources to demand has helped enable gains in asset utilization, including locomotive productivity. While the mix headwind from running lower coal volumes largely drove the 1% decline versus the third quarter of 2014, this fleet productivity metric has improved 6% sequentially from the second quarter levels. To wrap up, as we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to an incident-free environment. And while we gained significant traction throughout the quarter, we continue making operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise to deliver service products our customers have come to expect. With our resources now closely in line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to further reduce costs. Ultimately running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increases returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was just under $5.6 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with negative business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.4 billion, decreasing 13% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense decline were significantly lower fuel expense, along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements. The net result was a 5% decrease in operating income to $2.2 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $30 million, up from $20 million in 2014.  Interest expense of $157 million was up 9% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased about 7% to $781 million, driven primarily by reduced pretax earnings. Net income decreased 5% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share, down 2% versus last year. Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of $5.2 billion was down 10% versus last year. Volume declined about 6%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $407 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year, and this includes the net impact from both the fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. And as we expected on our last earnings call, business mix was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the third quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in Frac sand, steel shipments, and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international intermodal volumes. Looking ahead, business mix will continue to be a headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. While down slightly from first half levels, core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals. Moving onto the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 2% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiency, as we continued to realign our workforce. Labor inflation was about 4% for the third quarter, driven by agreement wage inflation as well as high pension and other benefit expense. For the fourth quarter, we expect labor inflation to also be about 4%. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was flat when compared to 2014. And excluding our capital related employees, however, our workforce level declined about 3%, and as Cam just mentioned, we made significant TE&Y reductions in the third quarter, and we are more closely in line with current demand. For the fourth quarter, we now expect our total force levels to be down 1% or so when compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.  Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $484 million, down 45% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 8% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 40% to $1.81 per gallon. Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 9% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair cost associated with our locomotive and car fleet. Depreciation expense was $507 million, up 5% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to increase about 6% for the full year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million, which is down 3% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and volume related expenses were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $205 million, down 15% versus last year. Decreased freight, equipment and property damage costs along with a reduction in general expenses were the primary drivers. We now expect other expense to be close to flat on a full year basis, excluding any large unusual items. Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the third quarter operating ratio came in at a record 60.3%, an improvement of 2 points when compared to the third quarter of 2014. The operating ratio did benefit about 1.5 points from the net impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter. Earlier in the year, we challenged the organization to safely and efficiently right size our resources and reduce cost, and I am pleased with the results that we have been able to achieve. Ongoing productivity initiatives, along with pricing above inflation, have been key drivers to improving our overall margins. Turning now to our cash flow, year-to-date cash from operations increased to just over $5.6 billion, and we invested around $3.3 billion in cash capital investments through the first three quarters.  Taking a look at the balance sheet, we continue our efforts to rebalance our capital structure, while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. Our adjusted debt balance grew about $1.6 billion through the first three quarters of this year, taking our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 44.5%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA has increased from 1.4 times at year-end to 1.6 times at September 30 on a trailing twelve-month basis. This is consistent with our target ratio of 1.5 plus. Longer term we define that to mean less than two times.  Our profitability and cash generation enable us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to shareholders. Year-to-date we have repurchased more than 28 million shares. Almost half of these shares were repurchased in the third quarter. Year-to-date spending totaled $2.9 billion. The third quarter alone was up 45% versus last year to over $1.2 billion. This demonstrates our opportunistic approach in the marketplace, and should not be considered a new quarterly run rate. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned $4.3 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of 2015. This represents roughly a 22% increase over 2014. Why we have made good progress in the third quarter we do expect to see some difficult year-over-year comparisons as we close out 2015. In the current demand environment, continued lower volumes versus last year and an even more challenging business mix will bothnegatively impact fourth quarter results. And when we compare it to last year, fuel prices will also continue to have a negative impact on earnings for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of last year, making the fuel comparison more challenging year-over-year. On the plus side, we will continue to focus on achieving solid core pricing gains and building on the progress that we have made with our cost reduction and productivity initiatives. And when you add it all up, we will fall short of last year\u2019s fourth quarter and full year earnings per share records. As for next year, we are still early in the planning process. It looks like we may have opportunities in many of our business segments, but it also appears that our energy related volumes will continue to be challenged. Given the uncertain environment, we are taking a hard look at our capital spending for next year. We haven't finalized our plans, so it too early to tell how it will relate to our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue. But from an absolute dollar perspective we do currently expect that it will be somewhat less than this year\u2019s $4.2 billion, and the plan does include the acquisition of around 200 locomotives as part of a long-term purchase commitment. Overall, we will remain intently focused on running a safe, cost efficient and productive operation, and we remain committed to providing our customers with excellent service and our shareholders with strong financial returns.  So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Rob. As you have heard from the team, we have made great progress in meeting this year's challenges. Our operating metrics have improved to more efficient levels, and our resources are now more closely in line with demand. We will continue our unrelenting focus on operating safely and providing a quality service product for our customers. We will also continue to grow existing business and to establish new markets. Even so, as Rob said, there are some question marks as we finish 2015 and head towards next year. One uncertainty, of course, is the extension of the positive train control deadline. We continue to believe that Congress will do the right thing for our country and our customers and will vote to extend the deadline. Beyond that, energy prices, the consumer economy, grain markets, the strength of the US dollar, all will be key to future demand. Over the long term, we are well positioned to safely provide our customers with excellent service, while delivering strong value to our shareholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question. David Vernon : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Rob or Eric could you help us frame the \u2013 how challenging coal could be next year from a volume outlook if we were to assume kind of normal demand patterns, gas prices kind of staying where they are, are we looking at similar declines as we saw this year or something smaller than that? Rob Knight : As we said David, coal demand really depends on a couple of major factors. One the competitiveness against natural gas, and so what the outlook for natural gas pricing is, and certainly the weather and certainly export markets will have an impact on the coal market. Now at this point if you look at natural gas futures, there is no discernible improvement in that natural gas pricing. So you would assume natural gas will remain very competitive versus coal. I don't think you would project any improvement of coal market share against natural gas pricing and the weather is always an open factor. David Vernon : But deterioration, would you expect \u2013 are there things that about your retirements on your fleet or new builds anywhere in the network that will give you some cause for saying that there is going to be material deterioration assuming the competitiveness remains unchanged? Rob Knight : So, again the main driver is kind of the competitiveness of coal. I think you should also look at the current inventories. The inventories as we mentioned are about 20 days above historical five-year average levels. They are actually about 30 days above last year third quarter levels. So you can assume that there would be some desire of utilities to manage those inventories down to a more normal level. David Vernon : Okay, great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on the pricing, obviously we heard a little bit from one of your interchange partners down in the Central South making some discussions on rates to maybe incentivize some coal burn. How do you guys think about that, are you guys changing your thinking about that given the change in competitiveness right now of coal and natural gas? Lance Fritz : We don't about specific customer issues or specific commercial issues with customers. Our strategy has not changed. We think we have a strong value proposition. We are going to price to the value proposition to generate a return for our company. Our strategy has not changed. David Vernon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Lance and team, great job on the operating ratio, but now that you are kind of at this 60 level, you maybe talk a little bit about what projects you still have that can improve, obviously we saw tremendous improvement in the velocity during the quarter, is that something that you still see can return to even a couple of year ago levels and there is more room to get that into the 50s, and maybe just talk about what projects you have underway that can keep improving that into the next few years? Lance Fritz : Sure Ken. Before I turn it over to Cameron for a little more technicolor, like we have answered historically, there are just almost limitless opportunities for us to continue to improve the business. What you saw in the quarter and what we have reported for an average quarterly fluidity reflected in velocity has been accelerating through the quarter. So as we are stepping into the fourth quarter we feel pretty bullish about the ability to continue to make gain. And the other thing to think aboutfrom a service perspective is while the fluidity of the network at this moment in time looks like it has that any previous period from the standpoint of very good. There are still opportunities in specific service products that we can continue to make strides on. So Cameron, I will give it to you to talk a little bit more specifically about projects for productivity. Cameron Scott : We continue to see opportunities in a number of different areas, including variable cost control, train length growth, terminal productivity, see greater fuel efficiency, and engineering and mechanically \u2013 efficiency initiative to help squeeze out as much productivity as possible. And we are gaining traction in all of these areas as Rob mentioned. Ken Hoexter : Great. I appreciate the insight. If I could just have a quick follow-up on the [fuel] pricing, you mentioned that it decelerated to 3.5% from 4%, is that due to more truck competition, I don\u2019t know, Eric, if you mentioned it, I don\u2019t know if their pricing contract's down or what's driving that, but maybe you can dwell into that a little bit. Rob Knight : Ken, this is Rob. Let me jump on that. A couple of points. One, how we calculate price, very proud of it. That is, we only count what actually moves. So, we calculate the yield, the price. So, the point being, volume has an impact clearly on our reported price. Anything I would say is our attitude. Our focus has not changed at all in terms of our commitment and understanding to drive price as a key contributor to what we've been able to achieve up to this point and it will be a key contributor as we move forward, continuing to get that solid core pricing. And I wouldn\u2019t read too much, frankly, into the change from the second quarter to third quarter, because there is volume issues, there is the legacy that we called out. And there is some round, we always round the numbers in terms of what we report here. So, there's not as big of a gap if you will from the second to third as you might otherwise think. Again, our commitment and our focus on pricing is unchanged. Ken Hoexter : I appreciate the comment and insight. Thanks, guys. Rob Knight : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Seidl : Now, thank you, and good morning everyone. You guys talked a little bit about some of the east coast business not falling back to not all there at least flowing back to the west coast ports. Do you think it's now permanently based on the east now, do you think peoples change their supply their supply chains? Eric Butler : This is Eric, Jason. Now, we do not. Frankly, as we said last quarter and I think the previous quarter, we do think that ultimately the cheapest best fastest supply chain will win and that still is west coast ports. There are still probably a couple 3% points of share that migrated over to the east coast ports during the port strike that has not migrated back. We think some of that is just some short term risk management, some hedging for the market and retail inventories. But we fully expect that the shortest quickest, most economic supply chain wins in the end and that's the west coast. Jason Seidl : Okay. Now, that's great color. And Rob, just a quick question on pricing. I think you mentioned that about half a point was due to the legacy mix brought forward, just had. So, as we certain looking out to 16, should start just basing our assumptions on about 3% core pricing? Rob Knight : Nice try. Jason Seidl : You can't [blame the guy]? Rob Knight : No, I get it. I mean, clearly we are saying that you can assume that the legacy is not going to continue, but in terms of what happens underneath or beyond legacy, we haven\u2019t given a precise number of guidance, other than our commitment to core real core pricing gains above inflation. And we're not changing our attitude or focus there. What the number actually ends up being, stay tuned. Jason Seidl : Sounds good. Guys, I appreciate the time as always. Rob Knight : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. You been, I was going to ask a couple of questions on price and I guess is understanding, you are saying you're not changing your approach, but the market can change. And so, I'm wondering whether you perceive that what we heard about from just you and presumably another competitor taking a rate down on call. Do you think that the market is changing in terms of more broadly than that or would you say look there are targeted action that you really shouldn\u2019t read into broadly. Because I think you're clear on what you're doing, but the market matters as well. I just want to -- what do we think on whether the market is really going to change or not? Lance Fritz : Tom, this is Lance. Historically, we've always focused on providing an excellent product and then charging for the value that that product represents to our customer base. We faced markets that are very difficult, different headwinds and we faced very robust markets and that philosophy doesn't change. So, we are in a very competitive business. We compete aggressively for the business that we enjoy. And at the same time we expect to receive a price that represents the value that we provide and it has to be reinvestable. All that's real, and all that continues to be real as we look into the future. Tom Wadewitz : Is it fair, I guess, if we look at you versus the market or competitor how you want to characterize that? Over the last several years, it's probably you've been a little bit willing to give up some volume, I think there were some contract moved away from you in coal in 20 -- I think 2013 and 2014. And so, you say well that's an example of being formant pricing being willing to give up a little volume. Is it fair to say that then your behavior and that willingness to give up a little volume to keep prices, is that way we should view you saying we're continuing with the same thing? Lance Fritz : Tom, I wouldn\u2019t change my answer to you at all. We expect to be paid for the value that we represent and we expect to be able to reinvest in our business. Tom Wadewitz : Right, okay. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Rob Salmon : Thanks. To get back off of Kens' earlier question on the productivity front. It was very impressive that you guys were able to pretty much extent train length across the network and environment where volumes were down about 6%. Can you give us a sense of what sort of siding constraints you guys are have across the network and the opportunity to expand that further? Eric Butler : Both of the train side as you saw there, equates at about 6000 feet and almost 90% of our network is 7200 feet capable. So, we really don\u2019t have any siding constraints and it is up to us to maximize train length and meet customer commitments. So, well, we have a lot of opportunity in that category going forward. Lance Fritz : Yes. I would add, it's very dependent on the lanes around the network. We still do have targeted capital investment that's oriented towards siding length extensions and being able to increase maximum train length on a particular route over and above what you see as average train length here. So, there are always or right now there are opportunities for us to continue to invest targeted capital to make that happen but we're a far way away from being at our average train length threatening our current siding length. Rob Salmon : Thanks, really. I appreciate that color. With regard to PTC, Lance, you had briefly alluded to it in the prepared comments. Can you give us a sense of what the impact across the network would be if Congress doesn't extend it, and any lessons that you learned from the massive uptick in volume we saw on 2014 that you could deploy. Because to me, reading the announcement, the press release you guys had put out on the topic, it would impact a substantial amount of the network. Lance Fritz : Yes. So, Rob, what we've announced, well we said that we would do is there is not an extension. And again, I'm very optimistic that Congress will be prudent and well, has an extension before we have to take any action. But what we've said is around Thanksgiving, in order to remove TIH from our railroad, we would have to start imposing an embargo. And that would be impactful. That means we'd have to stop allowing interchange product onto us of those commodities as well as start working with customers, try to figure out a way for them to ship it an alternative lines. Also we said as we approached the end of the year, we would start working with our Amtrak as well as the commuter agencies that we host to stop passenger traffic. Both of them would be very bad for the U.S. economy and for commuters. The TIH includes commodities like chlorine, that's used to clean drinking water. It includes products that go into fertilizer and other manufacturing processes. So, that would all have an impact on the U.S. economy. And then you can imagine in a place like Chicago, if the commuter lines were to stop running January 1, what commutes would be like for the 300,000 people a day that rely on those commuter lines. Rob Salmon : Thanks so much for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Kim : Hi, good morning guys. Nice quarter. With regard to the cost side, obviously we're seeing them come down year-and-year but also importantly sequentially. I'm trying to get a sense of like the pace of declines we should be anticipating for the -- the fourth quarter? Do you think the run rate we've seen in Q3, is it a reasonable Q-on-Q? Lance Fritz : Rob. Rob Knight : Yes. Tom. I wouldn't take the run rate because we're satisfied that we make great progress, but that was a pretty steep successful decline from the second quarter which we're very proud of. And all I would say to you is we are going to control the things that we can control and as Cam has mentioned we got continuing opportunities while we make great progress, right sizing and realigning the organization; we are not done yet. We're going to continue to take initiatives to squeeze that out and be as effective as we possibly can. So, the run rate probably will be different but the success of our -- continue to be realigned and look for every opportunities we can to further that productivity initiative will continue. Tom Kim : Okay that's helpful, thank you. And then -- hearing. And that chuck is our increasingly competitive with the rails. And there is the common suggesting with pricing down for the TL that are potentially conceiving less share. Obviously, that's more of a certainly a remote open. But I'm just wondering with regard to the rest of your book of business, how much could you sort of size up would be potentially at risk of diversion to trucking. I mean, my sense to that be relatively limited but I just would love to hear your thoughts on that. Rob Knight : Yes. I think if you look at what's going on currently in the trucking environment, the lower fuel cost is allowing trucks to be more competitive vis-a-vis rail just by virtue of that fact. Long term trucks still have the same systemic long term issue that they've always had in terms of driver shortages, some of the productivity headwinds that they have with some of the CSA regulations, the road congestion, etcetera. So, we are still very confident of our ability to drive truck conversions which we demonstrated even in the third quarter in earning a model business. Certainly trucks are great competitor and there is some competitive impact that we always, [indiscernible] and effort. We are still positive about the position that we are in as a rail and driving conversions from truck to rail. Lance Fritz : And case and point, you grew domestic intermodal in the third quarter by 1%. Rob Knight : Right. Tom Kim : Outside of intermodal, is it much of a threat or something we should be thinking about? Rob Knight : Trucks are always a competitor. We feel very good about our value proposition and our ability to compete. Tom Kim : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Rob Knight : Good morning. Scott Group : So, Rob, why don\u2019t you just follow-up your comment about head count in the fourth quarter being down about 1%. Could that imply a slight sequential increase from the third quarter average, even though ended the third quarter a lot lower than the average. I guess I'm just not throughout follow the down 1%. Are you adding head count back in the fourth quarter? Rob Knight : No. Scott, I just got to take you back. Remember, we had previously guided that we thought we would finish the year flattish with 2014, I think was roughly 48,000 number. What we're saying now given the confidence we have in the progress we've made today is we expect to end the year with the number being down a percent or so. So, I think compared to where we are now, it's flattish but a good volume and other initiatives will dictate exactly where that number lands but okay that's the map. Cameron Scott : Yes. Our job going forward, Scott, is -- Cameron, continued stay focused on getting the housing order from an operating craft head count. We are also in the process of getting our housing order on a non-agreement perspective. Right, we talked about that in an announcement late in the third quarter. And we've got an opportunity in capital head count particularly in light of Rob's discussion that capital is likely to be down next year. As we exit this year, we got an opportunity to make adjustments there. Scott Group : Okay. And then, Rob, you said a couple of times I think 4% labor inflation. What does next year look like? Rob Knight : We haven't finished our planning first next year, Scott, on a number of initiatives. But I think it's safe to say that the labor inflation will be lower than it was this year. Remember, this year we had the double wage, we had other issues that push the labor inflation full year up closer to that we had 5% to 6% in the first half of the year. So, I think it's competent, we're competent, says it's going to be lower than that. Exactly where that number lands at this point in time, again stay tuned. Scott Group : Okay, great. And just, last just a quick thing on the CapEx. Is your comment that it's going to come down but we may not be able to get it down all the way to 16% of revenue or a lots on table, we could get it even lower than 16%, we just don't know. Rob Knight : Yes. What I'm saying there is the absolute number we would expect to come down, but it may not be in that 16 to 17 guidance range, yet, because remember this year because of the fall-off in the revenue, driven largely by the fall-off in the fuel surcharge revenue. And as you know and others know, we don't set our capital plan based on revenue. It's just the kind of guiding marker that we provide to you. So, it's possible that we'll quite make it all the way down to that 16 to 17 depending on how the revenue number looks as we work through our planning process and that's what I am suggesting. Scott Group : Okay, great. Thank you guys. Rob Knight : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse group. Please go ahead with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning. So, I know there has been a lot of questions on price, but thinking about core prices of inflation, I was wondering if you could give us the sense of what overall rail inflation is currently running at? Rob Knight : Yes. Allison, this Rob. I mean, this year overall inflation again largely driven by that discussion I just had with the labor line is probably in the above three'ish, so maybe slightly higher than three, full year this year. Again, Allison, as you know, we don't set, again that's another marker similar to my discussion on capital. We don't set our pricing based on any one particular period inflation expectation. That's just a marker that we expect to continue to achieve above, that can be lumpy from one quarter to the next or one period to the next. But to answer your question, inflation overall was three-plus'ish this year. Allison Landry : Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about intermodal, how much of the decline in the segment stems from your main competitor taking some share back as its network recovers and do you expect a further bleed in the fourth quarter given that the end has opened the northern region and added some new expedited intermodal service from Chicago to the PNW? Rob Knight : Yes. So, Allison, as we mentioned, the decline in our intermodal space was really in the international and the mobile space. And there is really a number of different dynamics that are going on in that. One is not to complete remigration if you will from east coast to west coast so that that is progressing. One is as you know in the liner steam ship business there is a number of different dynamics going on there with the different alliances and different entities deciding what lanes they're going to put their ships in. And certainly, kind of the suggested softness in China and other parts of the Asian and them all having the impact on that. So, those are really the drivers in terms of our domestic intermodal franchise. As we mentioned, we grew. This will be the seventh consecutive year of record of volumes. We feel great about our franchise, the position of our franchise and the strength of our franchise. Allison Landry : Okay. So, just to be clear on your answer, BN has not taken any of the share back that you may have gained last year or that's just not a significant factor? Cameron Scott : So, as we talked at earlier earnings releases, we did have, I think Rob said a percent to 2% share benefit last year from business with the difficulties at our competitors, we fully expected that to migrate back and elsewhere in a couple of areas, those were intermodal, those were in grain, those were in coal, and we have NRC and those migrate back and backwards aligned with our expectations. Allison Landry : Okay, great. Thank you, very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. Rob Knight : Good morning. Justin Long : Maybe just a follow up on intermodal again. I know right now you're facing headwind from tough international comps, there is uncertainty in the retail space. So, I was just wondering bigger picture, when do you feel this business can get back to more of a GDP or a GDP plus growth environment versus the declines we've seen year-to-date? Eric Butler : Eric. Let me take a stab at that. The longer term, we feel very strong, very bullish on the intermodal product in general that in the long run is going to be driven in large part by U.S. consumers and consuming both international product as well as domestic product. It's also predicated on our ability to have a service product that can penetrate against a truck. And all of those secular dynamics are set up positively for the long run. In terms of dislocations that are happening in the short term, it's hard to time things out. It is very dependent on what happens in the U.S. economy, what the jobs pictures look like what the earning picture for consumers look like, what the U.S. dollar is doing. Adds then to all that, we're focused on controlling what we can control which is an excellent service product. We got the best franchise from a domestic and international intermodal perspective in the U.S. and that will serve us well over the long run. Justin Long : Okay, great. And maybe then just follow-up on that. Looking at your intermodal business today, I know it varies by lane but what's the average discount for intermodal versus truck in your network today. And longer term, where do you think that percentage could go without causing a significant slowdown in intermodal volume growth? Eric Butler : Yes. We've said historically, a 15% to 20% as a rough we look on, would be part of our core strategy of course, to minimize that as we increase our value proposition. Justin Long : Okay, great. I will leave it to that. Thanks for the time. Eric Butler : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alex Saraci with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Alex Saraci : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, you guys have obviously made a lot of progress on aligning the resources in light of the softer volumes. And I know the volume outlook is uncertain in a lot of areas right now and it's tough to actually point to where and what might drive an acceleration. But should volumes actually start beginning to surprise to the upside in 2016 for whatever reason? How do we think about your ability to kind of leverage the resources you have right now and do you feel like there is a lot of operating leverage in the business in where your resources are currently or would you anticipate you have to kind of add back pretty aggressively. I know it's kind of depends on what the volumes actually translate but how do we just sort of think about the operating leverage intermodal if volumes actually do surprise the upside? Lance Fritz : Alex, we would welcome nothing more than a surprise on the upside in terms of volume next year. And we are well positioned to be able to absorb that into the existing network. Cameron has got adequate locomotives and crews ready all around the network to be able to handle an uptick. The fluidity in the network would be able to absorb it rapidly. He and the operating team have done a great job in terms of getting the terminal and yard productivity up, and we will be able to bring in cars readily into that environment and handle it fluidly. And between Eric and Cameron and the rest of the team, they've done a stupendous job on stabilizing our train plan and making sure that it's robust enough to be able to handle some incremental growth. So, that would have significant leverage for us and we'd welcome it. Alex Saraci : Okay, that makes sense. And then just my second question here on, you suggested that there are some headwinds in the fourth quarter and that earnings per share would probably be down on a year-over-year basis. Can we kind of can you help us think directionally relative to the kind of 2% decline you saw in the third quarter? Can we expect another similar low single digit decline in the fourth quarter or probably a bit of a worse year-over-year move there, given some of the puts and takes? Rob Knight : Alex, this is Rob. What I am calling out there, I mean, we'll see how the world actually plays out in terms of volume. But as we look at this point, we're not giving precise earnings guidance. It does look like we're going to have a bigger headwind in the fourth quarter on mix year-over-year and the reason for that is last year's mix actually was quite favorable. And if you look at the business, we were running sand fairly strong, coal was relatively strong, Ag was a pretty positive mix player. And those are things that we just don't see repeating in the fourth quarter. In addition, as I called out, we see a headwind year-over-year in fuel because last year's fourth quarter we got the benefit of about a nickel of the timing of fuel the fourth quarter last year which we don't see that reporting repeating again this year. So, I am calling out that year-over-year, it does look to us like the fourth quarter does have some bigger challenges than frankly the third quarter did. Alex Saraci : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the coal network and the outlook for next year. Obviously, still some challenges particularly market share relative to natural gas. When you think about the network, one of your eastern competitors has started to make some changes in terms of the network, that's a little bit more structural in nature. I guess I'm just curious from your perspective how you think about that as you look out to 2016 and maybe beyond, given the coal outlook. Are there things that need to be done there or things you could do to potentially improve that the value proposition there? Lance Fritz : Chris, before I hand it over to Cameron for a little more technic color, the thing to note about our coal network is it's largely run on a shared network. So, we have made fundamental adjustments in resources that reflect coal being down. You see that in our adjustment to [T&Y] craft, the locomotives, it's also embedded in some of the cars that we've stored. And we're constantly looking at our assets as they are currently deployed to make sure they fit the demand profile for commodity like coal. Cameron? Cameron Scott : You are exactly right, Lance. And our coal network is truly built out. So, for us it's really more of how we manage the tangible assets around locomotives and crews and we'll continue to do that. Having said that, we'll continue to study the assets around our coal network and react appropriately. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that's helpful color, I appreciate it. And then, Rob, just coming back to you on the buyback just for a second. Obviously, you talked about it not being a run rate in the third quarter and that makes complete sense to me, I guess. If you could help us maybe think about how you might be opportunistic going forward, I guess I just want to get maybe a rough sense of maybe how you view that proposition as you think about this quarter and next is in terms of the buyback and the run rate we should be expecting? Rob Knight : Yes. I mean, Chris, I mean, you probably could. Right, my answer here and everyone would say, I mean, we're not giving precise guidance, because in terms of what we're in buyback. Because if we don't do that, I mean, we certainly value and understand the value of a continued buyback program. And we kind of walked our talk there. And as we've always said, we will be opportunistic in the marketplace, based on factors like the price of the stock. So, all those are factors in terms of how it will look as we play out into the next several quarters. We will continue to take the same mindset if you will, in terms of how we approach the opportunity and approach how many shares we actually do buyback. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much guys, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yes, good morning guys. I want to ask another one on the coal here. How much of the mid team's volume decline that you're tracking towards for this year? Would you attribute to the year-over-year decline in natural gas prices? Eric Butler : Bascome, this is Eric. It varies. I would say the vast majority of the decline is in some way or the other attributable to natural gas prices. As you know, they are different high sell regions that we operate in and the impact of natural gas is different in those regions. But I would say vast majority is attributable at the end of the day to the competitiveness of coal with natural gas with one other factor and that's being our export coal market, just the worldwide export coal prices, that's also a factor. Bascome Majors : Understood, I appreciate that. And just to follow-up, I know there is a lot of significant moving parts here, but say natural gas prices are flat next year, so you don't have that magnitude of a year-over-year headwind on that front and winter is normal. Just roughly speaking, what kind of 2016 coal volume outcome are you looking at here? I mean, is this the situation where you could be down double-digits again or is kind of mid-single digits more of what you guys are planning for? Eric Butler : Hey, Bascome, as I mentioned earlier, one of the other factors that is a factor is the current level of coal inventories that now at the end of the third quarter there are 30 days higher than where they were last year and 20 days higher than the average five year average. So, I would say is their expectation to assume utilities would work those down, not only maybe even to the averages or below the averages, but they're trying to be in inventory management mode. Bascome Majors : Understood. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you. Eric Butler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Yes good morning everyone and congrats on the good quarter here. I know cutting budget can be pretty difficult. So, Lance, by my calculation has been about 12 minutes since you got a question on pricing. So, I'm going to come back to it because I honestly think that's probably the biggest concern for your shareholders right now. But I just want to ask a more general question about the industry right now because it's kind of two parts here. If you look across the industrial landscape, we are definitely seeing deflationary pressure for a lot of your companies. Energy CapEx is likely to be down again next year and obviously commodity prices are a lot lower. So, it's just less value to extract from that supply chain when you think about it holistically. But then, secondly, I mean, the industry obviously has an issue here at PTC, we're late relative to while that was probably poorly written, but none the less in this environment where your customers are facing a lot challenges and we do have regulatory issues, how do we balance the reinvestment to service and the price equation such that we try to keep all the constituents happy? Lance Fritz : That's an excellent question, Brandon; one that we are constantly working on. Our primary focus, first and foremost is a robust reliable excellent service product and in that context it's making that service product better than the alternatives. That puts us in a position to be able to secure a price premium. And that represents the value of that service product. So, long as we're in that position, then we can handle the rest of the pressure points appropriately. And when it comes to a regulation, our best defense in a regulatory environment is happy customers and customers that are getting an excellent service product. That won't stop the conflict around the pricing discussions that we have, it won't stop regulators from wanting to find ways to regulate us. But it will stop some of the pressure and that's our biggest defense when we focus on those. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate that. And is there risk here though that if we face further declines, which it feels like we are in the fourth quarter, that this whole process just takes a little bit slower pace in terms of where our margin improvement return improvement, just understanding that we have a lot of other pressures across the industrial landscape? Lance Fritz : We are keenly focused on making sure we generate a really attractive return on our investing capital. Embedded in that is trying to make sure we continue to improve our margins. I think we've outlined today that there are ample opportunities to continue to make that happen. One of them is price, but it's only one of the mechanisms and that's what we're focused on. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question's from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks, very much and good morning. So, you cited a high retail inventory levels, the volume impediment for the last couple of quarters and I'm just curious how far along you think we are in drawing down those inventories and putting the inventory correction behind us? Lance Fritz : Yes. We've actually only mentioned it this quarter and little bit last quarter. So, it really depends on the consumer. Consumer confidence does appear to be strong, it does appear to be a trend where consumers are paying down debt and spending on non-product things like data, internet, healthcare services, etcetera. I do think if you talk to a lot of the BCO's and the retailers, they do have an expectation that with consumer confidence remaining strong, there should be a pickup during the holiday season of sales but time will determine whether or not that happens. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a very quick one on cost. You called out $50 million of inefficiencies last quarter which is down from a $100 million in the first quarter. And wondering what fell in the third quarter, if anything? Rob Knight : Cherilyn, this is Rob. Yes, we made good progress on that. Remember that marker that I was sharing with you in the first and second quarter was against the previous year and we feel very good about as Cam walked through. We feel very good about the quarter progress we made in better aligning our resources. Having said that, we are not done. I mean, that's last year it wasn't the end of the game. So, we still see opportunities for us to continue to squeeze out productivity initiatives on multiple fronts and we are going to continue to do that. But in answer to your direct question of compared to what I showed you last quarter on the year-over-year, we made very good progress in taking out those inefficiencies that we showed you in the second quarter. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, thank you. That's my two. Rob Knight : Thank you, Cherilyn. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of John Barnes, RBC Capital Markets. Please go with your question. John Barnes : Hey, thank you. And looking at the couple of the kind of car load outlooks on the positive side that you provided, I need the one they are starting to get a little bit of attention is the auto side. I know right now autos' continues to be very strong but with a soar that is at the historical kind of upper end of the range, any concern there that if you see a bit of a correction maybe a normalize level of production. And especially given the case you mentioned, we got retooling going on at a couple of Mexican facilities for GM and Chrysler. Is there any concern that you start to see maybe some of that growth in the auto sector slack off as we go into the new year? Rob Knight : Yes, John. I think that's a great question. Certainly as you mentioned, the SAAR's rate is kind of at a barn burner rate. The amount of debt associated with auto loans is that. I think the auto manufacturers would still be pretty bullish because of the features that they think they're providing to the consumer, and the average age of automobiles out there. But the sales rate is at a high number and so that by definition would indicate a little caution and concern. We don\u2019t have too much concern about model changeovers. There is always model changeovers. We see that year-in year-out. We have the benefit of a very broad diverse autos franchise and somewhere there\u2019s always that happening. So, we don\u2019t see that as too big an issue, but certainly the sales rate, the amount debt associated with sales, you could say something there to watch out for. Lance Fritz : Hey, John. Regardless of what SAAR is. What we really are pleased with is the UP Automotive franchise. It\u2019s outstanding, it gives us great access to Mexico, products produced in Mexico, gives us great access to the ports of products produced over season imported. And we have an excellent distribution system for finished vehicles on in the Western United States. We're in a very good place when it comes to the automotive franchise. John Barnes : Yes, no doubt. I\u2019m glad to see you taking advantage of that now. I just with a couple of the other pressure points out there and although having been kind of one of the bright spots I was getting a little nervous about. You need time to see a turnaround, maybe begin to return to normalization. That\u2019s just the reason for the question. One follow-up on the buyback, Rob, you talked about opportunistic in and I\u2019m just kind of curious, have you done buybacks overtime? Have you ever gone back in and you done a look at the success of your buyback program as maybe a program done a little bit more ratable per quarter a little bit kind of more consistent in terms of the absolute dollar spend or the absolute shares bought back versus maybe timing it a little bit and being more opportunistic in and if you ever looked at that and doesn't that guide you at all in terms of how you approach your buyback effort? Rob Knight : John, this probably will shock you, but we look at it every day and feel are very comfortable that what we have done to-date works for us. And we're not changing our approach or that how we look at it but I understand the point of your question, but rest assured, we look at what\u2019s the right way to deal with this and we\u2019re confident that we are doing the right thing. John Barnes : Very good. All right, thanks for your time today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please go ahead with your questions. Matt Troy : Thank you. Just a housekeeping question. I noticed in your commentary about expenses specifically on comp and benefits. You did not reference and sent it comping crew. The other railroad, it\u2019s been about tailwind to a two and a $0.2 to $0.6 per quarter. I\u2019m just trying to think about forward modeling in fourth quarter, was there a positive impact that you just didn\u2019t call out or is there potentially a larger crew up that we\u2019d expect to see in the fourth quarter as we round the quarter in the yearend? Rob Knight : Yes, Matt, this is Rob. Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t see any general -- not calling out that there would be any change in terms of the direction we've been and we haven\u2019t changed our approach. And so I don\u2019t anticipate of being any big swing in that. Matt Troy : Okay, thank you for that. And then just the second question would be on coal longer term. Obviously, the eastern rails have had to or and will have to continue to live under the threat of environmental regulations, which basically coin the question of viability of some of their sourcing basins as well as their customers. Some of the pushback we get from investors and union specific is hey those guys are kind of have to live through it to the next five years. It\u2019s a long time ahead of us but just wanted to get a sense, have you at very high level looked at whether it\u2019s plants being decommissioned, shutting down, or new gas-fired turbines coming online with your system. What potentially just could be vulnerable of your existing business as we look at over let's call it three to five years basis in terms of just sourcings which is just the viability of certain customers? Thanks. Eric Butler : Hey Matt, this is Eric. We look at that in depth continuously as part of our strategic and tactical analysis of our market. I would say that at a high level, coal continues to represent ongoing forward probably and necessary minimum third of electrical generation in the U.S. short of some new technology, I'll call it Star Trek technology just for short hand purposes. Coal, of necessity is going to be a part of the electrical generation of this country for the foreseeable future. And so I think you could perhaps the coal get to a minimum I'll call it a 30% market share but short of some really new generational technology and I think you'll right now for the foreseeable future that\u2019s probably the minimum that will be. Lance Fritz : Matt, this is Lance. So, I want to provide a little editorial comment as well. I think United States is blessed with the coal reserves that we are and our ability to generate electricity with coal, relatively cleanly, and it\u2019s never been as clean as it is today. It would be a mistake from the U.S. economy perspective, our competitiveness globally to continue to regulate that out artificially. I think we have to work on continuous improvement with the emissions from coal fuel generation, but it would be a mistake to artificially retard that too much. Matt Troy : Understood. Thanks for the detail everyone. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning and thank you for your time. My first question also on price. Against very strong yield that fuelled this quarter, the relative weakness in automotive and intermodal; could you please comment on the driver there whether it is mainly mix or comparative dynamics and how you expect them to play out into next year? And specifically, do you expect domestic intermodal to grow more strongly than international, with potentially positive impact on price? Thank you. Rob Knight : Hey, Cleo. The numbers that you see in autos and intermodal from kind of in our yield standpoint is really hindered by the fuel cost surcharge reduction. That's more than a 100% of that impact. Lance Fritz : And then, your second question was Mexico versus international on intermodal? Cleo Zagrean : No. Just [indiscernible]. I simply added back an estimated 4% to 5% fuel impact through each of the price boat of ton-mile numbers that we see there and I appreciate that fuel impact would be different across safe categories. But so maybe then you could comment, is that are we missing something by seeing auto and intermodal as weakest in terms of yield but for mile year-on-year? And then my second question was whether domestic should grow faster, domestic overall than international next year and that's get some help to pricing overall from mix perspective. Thank you. Rob Knight : Quick -- Cleo, this is Rob. Let me take that first question. I would caution you not to just use straight line numbers on it because I think the piece to answer to your question what you're missing, I think what you're missing in that analysis is mix. Mix has an impact within each of the commodity groups in terms of what ends up being reported as average revenue per car on top of each of their individual impacts from the fuel surcharge. So, I would just caution you that there are differences within each commodity group. Lance Fritz : Yes. And as you know we are not going to give guidance in terms of pricing in the future. We do think that the domestic intermodal market should continue to have strong pricing opportunities in 2000 and as we go into the future. Cleo Zagrean : Okay, but faster or slower than international with all the noise we had this year? Rob Knight : There is a lot of input, a lot of ins and outs that happen. There are lots of dynamics as you know going on in the international intermodal market that are dynamics being driven by other countries and steam ship liner carriers. We feel good about our value proposition. We feel very good about our domestic intermodal franchise and our ability to get price on that. Cleo Zagrean : Okay, I appreciate that. And the second question relates to CapEx. Can you please remind us of the share that you consider discretionary versus maintenance or require renditions given shifts in the geography of demand and highlight for us those discretionary areas in which it appears prudent with step back this time? Thank you very much. Rob Knight : Cleo, we've historically said and I don't think it's changed much to kind of maintain what we've currently got is about $2 billion plus minus number and after that it's things like technology, PTC, capacity additions, commercial facilities, new equipment, etcetera. Cleo Zagrean : Okay. And would you be willing to share any as if you're speaking to an engineer, what areas would you like to you think you see maybe prudent for as best candidate for retrenching next year? Rob Knight : As we are making our capital plans next year, we're just constantly evaluating both capital productivity in terms of dollar per unit that we put in the ground or buy and where exactly we're putting it. So, I won't make any commentary on exactly what those plans look like. Cleo Zagrean : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Hartford : Thanks, good morning. Rob, a quick question. I just wanted to use your perspective on the risks to continue to return on asset improvement for the rail line. You've done a great job doubling it over the past seven years. We talked a lot about pricing on this call but if you think about just the three simple factors to drive that higher going forward pricing volume growth and service improvement. In your mind, what is the biggest risk or a point of concern from your perspective as it relates to inhibiting continued ROA improvement for the rail lines of those three kind of fundamental inputs? Rob Knight : Yes. I mean you're exactly right, Ben. That the lever says you've heard us talking as you fully understand the levers that draw this from where we once where to where we are today are productivity which is driven by the service. That sort of has also enabled us to get the right place in the marketplace and volume is always our friend in that calculus. We are going to control those that we can best control. So, I would say, frankly, the biggest risk I see at this point is that which we have less control on and that's the economy and what that then gives us in terms of volume to play with. But as I've said many times and you've heard us say, we're not going to use the lack there of volume to slow us down on our initiatives to continue to make progress on that which we can control, but that's what we are going to continue to do as we have over the last decade. Ben Hartford : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Boy, you guys are popular. Congratulations. Question for Eric, kind of broader picture. As we look at the four areas that are kind of the biggest areas of the volume decline right now, so I will throw coal in there, metals, crude and frac, when are you hopeful that you will start to see positive year-to-year comparisons and then I have a follow-on related to that. Eric Butler : I think as we've been saying throughout the call, there is uncertainty about the going forward outlook in all of those and I am not sure our prediction will predict us any better than anyone else. Certainly the strong dollar is impacting our metal steel business, our domestic metal steel business, oil prices will be a direct factor in terms of the amount of drilling the amount of crude by rail and then the natural gas will be a direct driver in terms of the amount of coal. So, at those points, an ability to predict those items and that\u2019s right, have any better ability than anybody else in the marketplace to do that. Jeff Kauffman : Yes. I was just curious in your view, yes. All right. Let me just follow-up on that. The question was asked earlier, you're attacking the variable cost and you are getting a lot more momentum with that. And I think you mentioned we're not going to do much with the fixed cost in the coal network, but as you look at the railroad and how these business units have changed just over the last 12 months, where do you think there are opportunities to attack the fixed cost infrastructure beyond just taking down employees and taking down locomotives and assets dedicated to it? Lance Fritz : Jeff, this is Lance. Jeff Kauffman : Yes. Lance Fritz : I don't think we said we're not going after fixed cost. We focused the commentary on some of the variable cost, but where we have opportunity to for instance reduce our CapEx or for instance reduce the physical footprint of shops that maintain locomotives or other areas like that. We're going to take advantage of those as well. I think what we were trying to impart is that our coal network is not isolated and independent from our overall network. And so it would be very hard to tease out individual physical assets hard assets that are completely dedicated to coal and isolated on their own. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. So, hence the shared network term. Lance, thank you. Lance Fritz : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Don Brown with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Don Brown : Good morning, everyone. Real quick, and I kind of just trying to do some back of the envelope math here in -- look at what has been a 40% decline in fuel and as translated into essentially what is a 7.9% headwind in pricing, if I look at your reduction and yield realized and the core pricing of 3.5% that you stated. Would that imply that you would even if you were to go flat from the current levels that at least in the early part of next year you would have to -- he was looking at a 16% decline. I feel you'd have to achieve it essentially at 3.2% or higher core pricing in order for pricing realized to be flat? Lance Fritz : Rob? Rob Knight : Don, you may have stumped me in terms of the actual numbers that you just worked through because I frankly wasn\u2019t probably --. Don Brown : Relatively speaking. Rob Knight : Yes. But I would just say that mix is clearly a factor in that, so just be careful in your analysis to factor that in. Don Brown : Sure. Rob Knight : And again, all I would say about the pricing, is, we are going to continue to focus on driving value to our customers, continue to drive productivity and continue to drive price where we can in the marketplace. And we know that the underlying value of our service product to customers is a key component to that and it all kind of hangs together there. So, we're going to continue to focus on driving as much as we can on it. Don Brown : Well, so, even with the best service available are you going to be able to go to customers whose volumes are down in the high single digit low double-digit range and as far and receive better than 3% pricing? Lance Fritz : Don, this is Lance. There is never a conversation at our commercial team enters into with the customer on price; that's easy. It doesn't matter if their volumes' up or the volumes' down. So, clearly Eric and his team into the environment that we are in right now have secured what in the third quarter 3.5% coal price and then in the previous quarters as much as 4% coal price. Though none of that came easy or was a layout and I expect them to continue that good hard work into next year's securing an appropriate price for the value that we represent to our customers. Don Brown : Fair enough, good luck. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much, Rob. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific, this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in January. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance M. Fritz: Good morning everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31 per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups with coal and industrial products down 22% and 16% respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the quarter with the volume up 8% versus 2014.  On the cost side, we continued to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our productivity initiatives. We will hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning. As a result of these efforts we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser focused on running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value added service to our customers and delivering solid returns for our shareholders.  So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric. Eric L. Butler: Thanks, Lance and good morning. In the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9%, with continued gains in automotive more than offset by declines in the other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, but it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and a strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter driven primarily by softer export of soybean meal and DDG [ph] demand.  Ethanol shipments were down 3% driven by lower exports. These declines more than offset a 14% increase that canola meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. Food and refrigerator product volumes were down 1% for the quarter as strength in the year was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments. Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. 2015 annual sales of the U.S. were 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. This seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles, the fourth highest quarterly sales pace on record. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and a continued focus on over the row conversions to over 8% increase in volume. Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments which were down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was continued strength in the LPG markets including Propolene, Propane, and Bueten demand. Finally petroleum products volume was down 6% primarily due to weaker residual fuel oil shipments as a result of a slowing in China\u2019s production and export sectors.  Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices dampened coal demand. Temperatures in the fall was 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower 48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December, 39 days above normal, and 43 days above last December.  Colorado, Utah tonnage was down 40%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Nationwide electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 32% in 2015 as natural gas captured to share loss from coal. Industrial products revenue was down 23% and a 16% decline in volume and 8% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 52% decrease in frac sand car loadings. Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production, reduced drilling activity, and a strong U.S. dollar.  Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter driven by increased waste shipments. Intermodal revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter and a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per unit. Full year 2015 domestic intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions were offset by the discontinuation of Triple Crown business and sourcing shifts.  International intermodal volume was down 12% in the quarter in a challenging market environment primarily due to market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the Trans Pacific strait remained sluggish due to weaker than expected domestic U.S. retail sales.  Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016. In Ag products we expect high global grain inventories and the strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and refrigerator should continue to see growth in import beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year but we will likely fall short of the record level reached in 2015.  Turning to autos we expect low interest rates and gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand driving both finished vehicles and part shipments. However, we are cautious as the auto sales sustaining these record levels. We expect the coal market will continue to be dampened by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As always weather conditions will continue to influence demand. In chemicals we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016 with particular strength in LPG markets. Low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments. Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds.  In industrial products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber franchise to grow with demand from the slowly strengthening housing market and demand for construction products in specialized markets should be solid. In intermodal we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive domestic intermodal volumes. However, high retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international intermodal volumes.  Wrapping up, while the strong U.S. dollar, low energy prices, and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds and uncertainty in some of our markets, we are optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity driven by energy reform and Mexico's autos manufacturing market. With our growth depending on both the national and global economy we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. With that I will turn it over to Cameron. Cameron A. Scott: Thanks Eric and good morning. Starting with our safety performance of our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the work place is clearly having a positive impact as we achieve annual records on our way to an incident free environment.  With respect to rail equipments incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved results going forward.  In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvements in the future. Moving onto network performance, after making a step function improvement in our operating metrics during the third quarter we have continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 13% and 5% respectively when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at the best ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter.  In fact the last quarter we ran at this velocity was six years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer car loads. The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the Eastern portion of our network during late December thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. But while we have made significant improvement in our metrics we know there is still more work to do as the team continues a relentless approach to further improve service and reduce cost.  While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely in line with demand at that time, further declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting to lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer recruits, lessening resource demands of our network.  By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or an alternative work status compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictates.  In addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base, we also realized gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. While we are unable to overcome the volume decline within intermodal, we ran record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched.  In addition to process improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increased the fluid capabilities of our network. In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. The plan includes 230 locomotives as part of a previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control during 2016. In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016 we are carrying that momentum forward as we continue to focus on those critical initiatives that would drive future improvement. Above all, this includes safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on a way towards zero incidents.  In the face of uncertain volume environment, we will continue to adjust our resources to demand while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce costs. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom line to increase utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for our customers with an excellent customer experience. With that, I will turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight, Jr: Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes and even more challenging business mix and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel expense along with volume related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by 2014's real estate gains. Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the year. Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income decreased 22% versus 2014 while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share, which fell well short of last year's record $1.61 per share. Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume declined 9% and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. And keep in mind we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs.  As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments, and bulk grains partially offset by a decline in international intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends.  Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed in 2015. With the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out years, 2015 marks an end to any further legacy re-pricing opportunities. Moving on to the expense side, slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Looking at our total workforce levels our employee headcount declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in TE&Y, training related activities, as well as employees associated with capital projects all contributed to the workforce decline. At this point in time given current volume levels we are being very cautious with our hiring plans for 2016.  On average for the year we would expect overall force levels to be down somewhat depending of course on how volume ultimately plays out for the year. Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $424 million down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 14% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year our fuel consumption rate increased 1% driven by negative mix while our average diesel price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon.  Moving onto to our other expense categories, purchase services and material expense decreased 11% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair cost associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year.  Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $305 million, which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable one time item in 2014. Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and increased personal injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses.  Other expenses for the full year were flat when compared to 2014 consistent with our full year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% excluding any large unusual items.  Turning to our operating ratio performance, the fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2% and 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year I am pleased to report an operating ratio of 63.1 which is 0.4 points improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, right sizing our resources to current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our overall margins.  Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014. And net income was just under $4.8 billion while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share.  Turning now to our cash flow, in 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion down slightly when compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This was down just under $1 billion from 2014 primarily driven by lower earnings along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This includes the two dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015 resulting from the timing change in our dividend payments. As expected the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015 cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years. Taking a closer look at 2016 we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation was passed just before year end. We are factoring in the two years worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior years, the expected net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year\u2019s cash flow.  Slide 30 shows our 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned we are targeting a capital plan in 2016 of about $3.75 billion pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. This would be a reduction of over $500 million from last year\u2019s capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments over the last few years. Return on invested capital was 14.3% in 2015 down 1.9 points from 2014 driven primarily by lower earnings.  Taking a look at the balance sheet, while cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year we increased our balance sheet debt by 24% resulting in an all in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year end 2015. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7 which increased from 1.4 at year end 2014. Longer term we are continuing to target a debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times.  While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet which is a valuable asset particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. In 2015 share repurchases exceeded 35 million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion up 7% from 2014. Over the past five years, we have repurchased 15% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and are share repurchases we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014 continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value.  So that\u2019s a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy related volumes will continue to be a challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter we expect this year's first quarter coal volumes to decline around 20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with coal it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be down in the mid single digits.  For the full year we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative depending on coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out. Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings at least in the first quarter given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures particularly in the first quarter and likely throughout March of 2016.  We are counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer term operating ratio target of 60% plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019. And as always no matter what the environment we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad for our customers while generating strong returns for our shareholders. So with that I will turn it back over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz: Thanks Rob, and as we discussed today this past year was a difficult one in many respects. But our team did outstanding work in the face of dramatic declines in volumes and shifts in our business mix. Overall economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices, and the strength of U.S. dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year. However, our velocity is at an all-time best for the current level of demand. The network is fluid, and we are driving towards further improvement. We are well positioned to efficiently serve customers in existing markets as they rebound. The strength and the diversity of the Union Pacific franchise also will provide tremendous opportunities for new business development as both domestic and global markets evolve. When combined with our unrelenting focus on safety, productivity, and service these opportunities will translate into an excellent experience for our customers and strong value for our shareholders in the years ahead. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Salmon : Hey good morning and thanks for taking the question. Rob, with regard to your comments about the legacy pricing, further we saw about half a point in the fourth quarter. When you re-priced some of the legacy contracts, you had pulled forward some from 2016, should we still be considering some sort of incremental benefit in 2016 to the core pricing metric as we look out or should that effectively be zero for next year? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yeah, I would say, basically, effectively zero. I mean, there might be a tad bit of little carryover, but I think for your modeling purposes, those are pretty much behind us. Robert Salmon : Got it. And then I guess shifting gears Eric to the intermodal segment, you had called out some headwinds in the fourth quarter related to Triple Crown and some sourcing ships. Can you kind of quantify how we should be thinking about that Triple Crown headwind for 2016 or your quad specifically, the volume challenge that you guys saw and should those sourcing ships that we saw in the fourth quarter continue to weigh on intermodal load growth for the domestic volumes as we look out? Eric L. Butler: Yeah, Rob. As we indicated, we still we always expect our highway conversion strategy which we are firmly focused on to continue to drive growing domestic intermodal volumes. And so, we continue to see growing domestic intermodal volumes despite headwinds from Triple Crown and other things that occur all the time. We do expect as I called out to see headwinds on the international intermodal side, just because of all of what's going on with the trends in simple [ph] trade in the China markets. But on the domestic intermodal side, we continue to see our strategy working, which is growing volumes through highway conversions. Robert Salmon : Got it, appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Yeah, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. Lance or Eric, I mean, can you guys just give us some context here because I have only been covering the industry for about a decade, but the volumes seem pretty bad right now. I mean, maybe not quite as bad as 2009 and yet we are still getting jobs growth in the U.S. So how do you look at the environment right now? Is the U.S. headed into a broader recession or is this just limited to energy and industrial and other specifics in your business that maybe look worse than the broader economy? Lance M. Fritz: Brandon, this is Lance. The impact on all railroad has been acute as you point out in energy, in commodities affected by the strong dollar like export grains, steel markets, and those are not necessarily indicative of a broader U.S. reality. I will share with you though there is also questions that we have about U.S. consumers. There are indicators that the consumers are healthy like the unemployment rate is at a comfortable 5% level, the consumers are buying automobiles as Eric outlined. But labor participation rate isn\u2019t that great and fourth quarter retail sales for goods was not that great. So I will let Eric give you a little more technicolor. Eric L. Butler: Yes I am not sure there is much else I would add to that. I would say the consumer is spending, there is consumer confidence, household income is going up. There appear to be a shift between consuming on products or goods, spending on services. There does appear to be that shift so it does some of the changes is impacting our business and the industrial space. Lance M. Fritz: Yes Brandon one last thing, early in the year we talked about the impact on energy from low natural gas prices and the effect on coal, the effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration to development and we said ultimately that should be a benefit to other industries we serve like plastics manufacturing and consumers. And we just haven't seen yet the offset, the positive offset from the headwinds that we\u2019ve experienced. Brandon Oglenski : Well I know it\u2019s difficult for a lot of investors on the line here too. Well Rob can you talk a little bit about the outlook for an improving operating ratio? What are the big drivers here especially with the uncertainty in volume? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yes the big driver, I mean volume obviously is our friend and I guided as you picked up that we expect full year volume to be slightly down. We\u2019d obviously like to see that improve from there but given that slightly down sort of view of the world and a positive improving operating ratio is our conviction around our ability and our focus on continuing to drive productivity and our ability to continue to provide quality service to our customers enables us to get price in the marketplace. Brandon Oglenski : Okay appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Hi there, good morning. Want to touch a little bit on the outlook or stay on the outlook for 2016. Rob, I know you don\u2019t give earnings guidance specifically but if you can get sort of slightly down volumes, you have an improving OR, mix is going to be negative certainly in the first quarter or so of the year, I mean how do we think about the other puts and takes that potentially sort of impact that whether you are sort of flat to down or flat to up, I am just trying to make sure I understand how much you can control on the expense side to maybe offset some of this negative mix that we are expecting? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Chris, I mean and the reason that I am not giving earnings guidance is because of all those unknowns. We are confident we can control what we can control which again is the productivity, quality of service, continue to drive positive price but there is so much uncertainty at this point in time in terms of what the absolute volumes will be and what the mix of those volumes will play out. So, that\u2019s why we are not at a position right now to give earnings guidance but I assure you we are focused on driving improvement on every aspect that we can and we certainly would like to see as positive results as we can drive. Chris Wetherbee : Okay and then maybe just to follow up on that, in terms of the expense side what you can control you talked about headcount a little bit in the outlook and I think you said it would be down a bit, I guess you are entering the year with it down little bit more than that and kind of trying to chase that volume number down, I mean how do we think about sort of headcount for the full year in a little bit more detail? Robert M. Knight, Jr: I mean Chris, as we\u2019ve said all along and I\u2019ll say it here again for 2016 is that volume will drive what our headcount ultimately is although there is still productivity. So volumes are slightly down. I would expect that we would have down headcount driven by volume and layering on our expectation of driving further productivity. So it will flow with directionally with what volume is but we are very focused getting to see what the mix actually plays out, very focused on driving productivity in those numbers and being as efficient as we can. Lance M. Fritz: Chris we outlined for you the expectations for volumes in the first quarter in a few specific areas. I would say we are in a much better posture entering 2016 from a realizing productivity in a headcount perspective, getting the resources right for the volumes than we were entering 2015. We are just in a very different place. Chris Wetherbee : That\u2019s helpful, thanks for the time, appreciate it? Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions. Allison Landry : Good morning, thanks. So following up on the previous question, how much of a volume decline do you think that you can handle while still generating positive earnings growth. You did mentioned expectations for a slight decline but if car load has tracked down 5%, 6%, 7% is that sort of where you are thinking about the tipping point? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Allison, this is Rob. I mean I can\u2019t give you and not giving guidance on the earnings. So I mean I get the point of your question but really the driver will be what's the mix, what volumes actually move, and etc. But I can just assure you that there is obviously a tipping point at some point, if that were to go so negative it would flip the other -- flip negative. But we are going to squeeze out productivity and continue to drive price where we can and so I can\u2019t give you a direct answer as to where that tipping point is. But we are focused on regardless of what the volume is on controlling what we can and driving positive OR and earnings. Allison Landry : Understood, thanks. And then my second question would be what your expectations for overall cost inflation are for 2016? Thank you. Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yeah, as I said Allison, overall inflation assumptions for us in 2016 are around 2%. Allison Landry : Okay, excellent. Thank you. Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Scott Group : Hey thanks, good morning guys. Lance M. Fritz: Good morning Scott. Scott Group : Rob, just wanted to clarify a few things that you said. In terms of headcount down slightly or something like that, I mean, we're going to be starting the year down 9% or so year-over-year. Are we talking about down slightly from kind of where you are ending the year at that 44, 45 level? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Basically that guidance or that view of the world Scott, that where I say it\u2019s slightly down is a year-over-year assumption at this point in time. And again full year. And again, what will drive that is what the ultimate volumes end up being. Cameron A. Scott: Scott, just a little point of detail. At the tail end of many years, there is a lot of moving parts that affect headcount, the absolute headcount number. But the average is the one that\u2019s most useful. Scott Group : Are you thinking about adding headcount from where you are right now because if you take where you are right now, I mean it should imply pretty meaningful drop in headcount? Cameron A. Scott: We are going to continue to match headcount to whatever the volume situation is. The other thing to note is headcount comes in and out on capital programs as for instance in the winter time we start shutting down capital spend because of the weather and spooling it backup in the spring. There is just a lot of moving parts quarter-to-quarter sequentially. Scott Group : Okay. In terms of pricing, wanted to ask, so I think BN has talked about giving up some price to incent some coal demand. Are you guys doing anything similar like that and maybe if you can talk overall on pricing, it sounds like you expect solid pricing in 2016. Is it reasonable to expect some kind of deceleration in the pricing environment, just given what the volumes are doing or can we -- do you think we can hold steady around this 3% range actual legacy? Eric L. Butler: Hey Scott, this is Eric. So I cannot speak to what the BN does with pricing strategy. They do their own independent strategy and I cannot speak to what they do. We continue to hold on our strategy of pricings for our value. We are driving a value proposition that we want to be an industry superior value proposition and we are going to price accordingly for that. We do think that there are places in the market and the economy that are growing and we think that those provide value for us to continue to price according to our long held strategy. Scott Group : Okay, alright. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alex Saraci with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions. Alex Saraci : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Rob, I know you didn\u2019t give explicit earnings guidance, but in the past two years you had noted in your slide deck record earnings and that was note -- that kind of was notably absent this time around. So I just want to confirm that we should interpret the lack of that expectation for record earnings to be what it is, that you won\u2019t at this point you do not expect to achieve at least the $5.75 in earnings per share that you achieved in 2014, which was the last record. I just want to confirm, you are essentially expecting this year to be below that figure? Robert M. Knight, Jr: That is correct. Now nothing would please us more than to see the economy turn and things are going to go favorable. So we are going to fight like heck to do the best we can. But yes, you are correct. At this point in time, we do not see record earnings. Alex Saraci : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just to touch back on the pricing discussion, you noted that you expect inflation to be 2% in 2016. In the past, you've always kind of suggested nominal pricing, above inflation. Is that still your expectation for 2016 to achieve pricing above that 2% inflation level? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yes. But as you know, we don\u2019t set our prices based on what current year inflation numbers are. And as has been pointed out we\u2019ve discussed here today we priced the market. Every market is a little bit different. We clearly don\u2019t have the benefit of the calling half point legacy renewal that we\u2019d enjoyed in 2016 but having said all of that yes we are still focused on pricing above inflation. Alex Saraci : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the volume side. So you commented on first quarter and I think Eric in his slide with the 2016 outlook gave us the view by segment. If I look at that view by a segment it is either kind of plus and minus or I guess for coal it is minus, minus. But it seems like by segment it is pretty negative but on a full year basis you are saying it is down only slightly. So I assume slightly is not down 3 or 4, its maybe down 1 or 2. What -- how do you kind of bridge those two together? Is it just the function of the comps get so much easier in second quarter or are you expecting kind of adjusted for seasonality improvement in demand later in the year or how do you put those two together because it kind of by segment looked a little more negative than the comment about a slight decline on a full year basis? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Let me just start off and Eric may want to comment further and to maybe more specific, but this is Rob. I would just say that Tom to your point we clearly are highlighting and as you know that the comps particularly, the first quarter is particularly challenging and that\u2019s why we are calling out the down volume in the first quarter in coal clearly you know 20% or so range. So the comps do change throughout the year but our view of the world right now is that the energy environment which impacts our coal impacts our shale impacts our metals. It supports the shale activity on top of the continuing strong dollar. Those are going to continue to be hurdles and pressures for us. But the comps do change as the year plays out and I think that\u2019s what's driving sort of maybe the math that you are wrestling with. Lance M. Fritz: Eric you got anything else to add? Eric L. Butler: No, that\u2019s it. Thomas Wadewitz : So you would say it is more comps than anticipation of improved market later in the year? Robert M. Knight, Jr: I\u2019d say that\u2019s a bigger driver. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, I appreciate that. What about mix? If I look at your slides in third quarter mix I think it was a 1% year-over-year headwind and that got a lot more challenging in fourth quarter which I think was the big thing we missed in our assumptions for fourth quarter with that 4% mix headwind. I know it\u2019s a tough one to forecast but do you think mix in 2016 is more like the 4% or more like 1%, that\u2019s a pretty material consideration? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Tom, this is Rob again. I would say again as you know we don\u2019t and is very difficult, in fact frankly impossible to precisely predict exactly what mix is going to be. But I would say just sort of directionally if you look at the full year mix impact in 2015 it was about 1.5 negative and you are right, the fourth quarter was particularly bad at down at 4. We do expect to still see mix headwinds as 2016 plays out. I don\u2019t anticipate that it would be for the full year as bad as we saw in the fourth quarter. We do have a comp challenge in the first quarter but as the year plays out things should get easier and while mix will be headwinds for the full year it should sort of get better than what we saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ll see in the first quarter and what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Cameron A. Scott: Recall Tom first quarter of 2015, we grew frac sand shipments, coal was still relatively healthy, grain was healthier than what we saw as the year progressed into later quarters. So markets have really changed pretty dramatically from the first quarter of 2015. Thomas Wadewitz : So the mix comps might be similar to the volume comps that they get to be used your beyond first quarter. Maybe what\u2026 Robert M. Knight, Jr: We\u2019ll see. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your questions. Jason Seidl : Thank you, hey Lance, Rob, Eric, Cameron how is everyone doing. Cameron A. Scott: Jason. Jason Seidl : I want to go back on the pricing side and focus on intermodal and any of the truck competitive merchandise traffic that you are hauling. Clearly right now it seems that there is excess trucking capacity and all the data points at least we track are pointing to truck pricing going down both contractually and on the spot basis, how should we look at your ability to not only price but grow the intermodal business ex under the headwinds that we talked about with Triple Crown as we move throughout 2016? Eric L. Butler: Yes, this Eric, Jason. So, a big reason as you know for kind of the shrinkage in truck pricing is fuel is coming down which is a major cause. So, our customers are also seeing a cost reduction benefit as fuel goes down because of the fuel surcharge going down. So they are seeing that natural cost reduction benefit. So the gap if you will between the value proposition for intermodal rail service versus truck I think that, that gap is still there in terms of intermodal providing a value proposition to manufacturers. We have talked in the past about just by laws of physics steel wheel on steel rail is a lower costing, rubber tire on asphalt or concrete. So there still is a value proposition there that we think gives us a leverage to continue to drive highway conversions which we demonstrated in 2015 and we are going to continue to focus on in 2016. Lance M. Fritz: And Eric your team continually works with trucking companies themselves in terms of helping them with their cost structures and they look at intermodal conversions as an opportunity to modify their own cost structures as they compete in that marketplace and those opportunities continue as well. Jason Seidl : Okay, now that is good color. As I look on the Ag side, it seemed like there was a couple of puts and takes but net, net for the year, would you guys say you were positive or slightly negative for Ag? Lance M. Fritz: Eric. Eric L. Butler: I am not sure I understand the question. Jason Seidl : In terms of your outlook for 2016? Eric L. Butler: Oh, we don\u2019t give volume guidance for 2016. I think if you look at the Ag markets overall I think the Ag producers are expecting pretty good yields for 2016 of course depending on weather and number of acres planned in all of that. Maybe not record levels but pretty good levels. I think a large factor will depend on worldwide Ag production, strong dollar, and how competitive U.S. Ag is. In worldwide market there is a lot of corn, a lot of wheat in storage right now. And presumably as U.S. Ag becomes more competitive pricing wise in worldwide markets that's got to move and when that does move, presumably we as a transportation provider will have a benefit in moving in. Jason Seidl : Okay, gentlemen thank you for the timing as always. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from the line of Ken Hester [ph] Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Great, good morning. Lance, I want to revisit one of the earlier questions in terms of looking back in market downturns and looking at the volumes, how do you figure out how to stay ahead of that in terms of furloughing employees and cutting -- dropping locomotives in terms of them being not -- I guess not overdoing it so you can catch that rebound. How have you acted differently this time versus whether it was at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015 when we ramped up maybe too much and then versus what you saw in 2008-2009, maybe can you give us a little feedback in terms of how you prepped for that. Lance M. Fritz: Sure Ken. We have been clear historically about time lags in decisions that are just the nature of our business in terms of hiring somebody to operate a train. That is about a six month process. So, we have to by nature when we are planning crews look out 6, 12, 18 months. And when we are talking about capital planning or locomotive acquisitions those lead times get longer. So it all begins with our business planning process and making sure that we have tight connectivity between what Eric and the commercial team are seeing and then how we are boiling that into a transportation plan and the resources necessary to run it.  Every time we see a significant shift in volume, whether it is significant growth or significant shrink we try to learn from that situation. As we are going into 2016 we think our business planning process is tighter, we think our connectivity between what Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand more of that is being absorbed into our estimating process. And so I shouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the timelines let's say in terms of hiring and bringing a crew on board or acquiring equipment. We are also better candidly at when we have to store equipments, storing it quickly and efficiently and we are also better at trying to find the right mix of the right employee base where they are located and training them for alternative jobs. So we are just getting a little better in all those ways and that adds up I think into a better posture overall. Unidentified Analyst : And to clarify that you don\u2019t see that as rounding into like of 2008-2009 not that deep of a recession but into I guess so far what you seen doesn\u2019t seem a recession environment to you? Lance M. Fritz: Ken it is hard for me to speak and predict on whether the economy is going into a recession. Certainly our volume drop off as the 2015 year progressed quarter to quarter and as we are entering 2016 is dramatic and it is dramatic in historical reference but it is nothing, it is not approaching what we experienced in 2008 to 2009. I will tell again, a 6% decrease year-over-year and a quarterly 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% decrease year-over-year is pretty dramatic volume change. Unidentified Analyst : Great, if I could do a follow up just a quickly comment I guess yesterday or a couple of days ago one of the other rails noted your quotes on M&A and said that I guess prior you had talked about how it impacted Union Pacific and you are opposed to that. Maybe can you clarify your comments -- on your thoughts on industry M&A, why it would or would not matter to you given your operating in your own region, and does it -- in industry change impact Union Pacific? Lance M. Fritz: Ken we do not support mergers or consolidation in the current environment. We think that the regulatory outcomes, the regulatory impact would be substantial. The Service Transportation Board has been clear. That in the next merger that they consider it has to enhance competition not just maintain it. It has to improve operations for customers and they also have to consider downstream impacts whether one merger triggers a string of consolidations. We\u2019ve shared with you, we are focused on safety, we are focused on efficiency, we are focused on an excellent customer experience. We don\u2019t think a merger enhances those efforts. Matter of fact we think it would have a negative impact on service and be a headwind disincentive to capital investment. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the time and thought, appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan Chase. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Yes, hi good morning, thanks for taking the question. So, obviously one area of growth year-over-year looks like it is going to continue into next year, but how much of that is attributable to Mexico and what type of impact do you see when it comes to we are seeing it is from reported first half be tooling and change over staff of the border and do you think this should really have an impact on your length of hall or mix of business in that vertical? Lance M. Fritz: Brian, before I hand it over to Eric I just want to say we are very bullish on Mexico in general in the long term. It\u2019s a vibrant economy, it has got a vibrant middle class, and our access to the six primary rail gateways to and from Mexico give us a real great opportunity to participate in that economy. Eric? Eric L. Butler: Brian historically Mexico produced about 1.7 million vehicles. I think full year 2015 the number is probably closer to about 2.9 million vehicles. I\u2019ll call it 17.5 that were sold with all of the plant expansions and new plants I think it is on its way to 4 million or 4.5 million in the next call it year and a half to two years. As it has been said we have a great franchise for Mexico and we think that that will be a strong part of our business portfolio going into the future. As always, the issue is when the sales drive total volume and so our total volume will be aligned with whatever sales are. And our strategy is to have a franchise to move it wherever it is manufactured. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, then just quick on that, was it about 60% of your auto comes from -- is attributable to Mexico, I am remembering correctly? Eric L. Butler: Historically, we've said that, yes. And that\u2019s about what it was, yes. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And then just one another quick one on train lengths. I think in the last call, you mentioned you have about 90%, about 70,000 foot capable I guess in terms of sidings. Third quarter is around 6000 foot average train lengths. So include you are highlighting some of the best ever lengths in three of the five areas. How much further and I guess how much faster do you think you can take that up and when would you hit the upper limit? I know it's different in every market and I guess the intermodals clearly got some headwinds here. But I think that\u2019s really the one for good economics to really work, that\u2019s when you really need to get the longer trains, so you might be simply focused on that and just some general comments about train lengths? Lance M. Fritz: Cam, you want to talk a little bit about the productivity opportunity in train lengths? Cameron A. Scott: Coal is about the only program that is nearly optimized although there is opportunities still within coal. Every other commodity group has plenty of train size productivity opportunity and you will see us continuing to make progress, balancing customer needs along the way. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks for your time guys. Lance M. Fritz: Thanks Brian. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Troy : Yeah, good morning everybody. I have a quick question about coal, specifically a lot of pushback we get from investors with respect to UNP specifically as you have a competitor who due to some service issues and perhaps much larger portfolio strategy has invested significant amount of CAPEX out West and there is concern given the structural market share loss in coal and the competitive dynamic has structurally changed in their favor. If I look at a 20-year market share chart of coal, you and the BN used to swap share and were about 50% each every year. And then in 2011, we saw a split and then again in 2014. So there has been roughly a 10% shift where what used to be 50-50 is now 60-40. I was wondering if you could just put some color around that. I know that there were service issues in your line last year, but even if I normalize for that spike, the line and the trend is pretty consistent over a five year basis. I am just wondering how you can address structurally the investor concerns that something hasn\u2019t changed in the West as it relates to coal? Lance M. Fritz: Yeah Matt, I think if you go back historically and go back to the '80s when really the Powder River Basin franchise was developed for us certainly in addition to our competitor, I think it\u2019s been roughly call it a 55-45 split over time and as opposed to the 50-50. But we don\u2019t look at markets in terms of what share we have in a market. We look at it in terms of what's the value of that market, what's the value of that franchise where we think we have value, a value proposition to offer the market and we sell our value proposition and we are comfortable with the outcome in terms of the business that we win or lose based on the value proposition that we sell. Matt Troy : Right. So I guess, again in the context of people choosing to invest or not invest in your stock, if I look at the economy and volumes Burlington Northern positive on volumes last year in coal. Union Pacific down double-digit in coal. You are saying you are comfortable with that? Lance M. Fritz: What we are comfortable with Matt, is the diversity of our franchise. Coal remains a nice book of business for us, generates an attractive return, that\u2019s how we look at all of our book of business in terms of can we generate an attractive return and we invest for that and we price for that. And I think our track record speaks for itself. We\u2019ve done a pretty fair job of making that happen. Matt Troy : Okay, understood. My quick follow up would be then if I look at down cash flow, you yourself said I mean reducing the CAPEX budget by North of 500 million you have got some other tailwind, you talked about bonus appreciations, pretty material number as in terms of incremental cash flow potential. You slowed the pacing of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Just wondering with that excess potential cash flow in 2016, is there an opportunity to step up share repurchases, what are the guiding factors in terms of either debt ratios or what not, in terms of how aggressively you are willing to use what should be some surplus cash flow in 2016? Thank you. Lance M. Fritz: Rob do you want to take that. Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yes, Matt you are right. I mean our expectation coming off of certainly with last year's low number from cash flow that we will hopefully positively generate increase in cash flow. And yes, we\u2019ll continue our philosophy of being opportunistic in the marketplace as it relates to shares. So I would expect that we will continue to do that. And as I called out by the way in the third quarter that was a high watermark if you will that we\u2019ve seen at least in modern times of the rate of which we were buying back shares and that clearly was not our ratable rate in terms of shares. But we were opportunistic in terms of when we buy and how much we buy and that attitude and that philosophy will continue in 2016. But if we can generate stronger levels of cash that gives us greater opportunities and as we continue to walk up our debt to EBITDA as we said and as we have, it gives us further opportunity. Lance M. Fritz: Job one is generating cash from operations it all starts there and we are laser focused on that. Matt Troy : Understood, thank you for the time. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. John Barnes : Hey, thank you for taking my questions. So following up on that question around cap or cash flow I hear what you are saying in terms of your opposition to M&A, but if it were to take place Burlington Northern has already said that they are going to be involved if there is a waiver consolidation. Given the cash flow that you are looking at generating in 2016 do you feel the need to maintain some of that is dry powder in the event that you were forced to react to a consolidation wave in the sector? Lance M. Fritz: John in addition to saying we don\u2019t support rail mergers at this time we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re paying close attention to the situation, we\u2019re monitoring it and as things evolve we\u2019ll do what is in the best interest of our shareholders and our stakeholders. If you look at our capital structure we are in a solid position strategically if we had to do anything. But what we are focused on right now is that in the current environment we think mergers are not in the interest of our customers and just monitoring that and keeping close tabs on it. John Barnes : Okay, alright. And then my follow up is look I hate to ask you a such a short term type of question but Eric you mentioned in your commentary from intermodal risk perspective, record high inventories and you talked a little bit about your thoughts on the consumer. We got the Chinese New Year kind of right around the corner. Normally there is typically kind of a surge in activity ahead of that, do you anticipate or are you hearing from your shipper base, customer base yet that there may be some intention to use that period as an opportunity to kind of clear the desk a little bit, maybe clear the baffles on inventory and so you come out of maybe 1Q in a little bit better inventory situation or do you anticipate that you will still see maybe that normal pre Chinese New Year type of surge in intermodal volumes? Eric L. Butler: We are hearing nothing specific from our shippers surrounding the Chinese New Year to disclose here. I would say that every BCO is looking at rationalizing their inventories because they expect the holiday season higher than I think expected on inventories with sluggish retail sales. I think across the Board you hear every customer talking about trying to right size their inventories. John Barnes : Very good, alright, thanks for your time guys, appreciate it. Lance M. Fritz: Thank you John. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the magnitude of the record productivity you noted in your comments and how much of that is predicated on a slightly down volume environment, in other words if volumes end up being worse than you expect this year, is record productivity still achievable? Lance M. Fritz: I will make one quick comment and that is what we saw in 2015 was both cost coming out because of volume getting the structure right and a much more fluid network in the second half of the year generating excellent productivity opportunities. Robert M. Knight, Jr: Justin, I would just add, this is Rob, I would just add that kind of what gives us the confidence that marker that I would point you to is our improvement in our operating ratio throughout the full year and I am confident that we will continue to do that. In terms of at what pace we can do it, when they were all about doing it as quickly and as efficiently and safely as we can but what will drive sort of the timing of that productivity as we move with volumes is going to be the mix of factors and the timing of when do our volume changes. And as you know throughout 2015, the first half we are kind of chasing volume down and then we were able to sort of take advantage as things neutralize or straighten out a little bit in the back half. And so that will be a factor too in terms of what volume swings may or may not occur. But we are focused on squeezing out productivity as on everything we do and that's all I can point you to is that we will look at every stone and uncover it and look for opportunities. Justin Long : Okay, great. And I know you are not giving specific EPS guidance for 2016, but just putting together the pieces here slightly down volumes, core price increases, record productivity, better OR, the benefit of share repurchases just from a directional standpoint would it be correct to say that your thinking about EPS being up year-over-year? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Rob, the reason I am not giving guidance on the earnings is because there are so many uncertainties of which mix by the way is another headwind I would remind you of that. I did call out and that will dictate I think in large part exactly how this year plays out. So with all the uncertainties out there, we are going to certainly focus and fight like heck to take advantage of whatever the economy plays us to turn in as positive of earnings and returns and cash generation as we can. But we are not giving guidance as to exactly what the earnings will end up being for the year. Justin Long : Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time. Lance M. Fritz: Sure thing Justin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your questions. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much. Lot of my questions have been answered but let me come back to the cash flow question if I can, could you remind us of where you ideally want to have your debt levels whether you think about them as a debt to cap or debt to EBITDA and when I think about the positives to your 2016 cash flow, you mentioned about 400 million bonus depreciation, about 500 million less spend on CAPEX and for better or for worse with the shares down the way they are you can buy back shares that won't cost as much to still get your numbers on the share repo. When you look at 2016 given the increased uncertainty, are you more likely to say okay, we are going to buyback whatever shares we are going to buyback but with the excess cash flow we just may not need as much debt to fund it or is your view that you are still under levered and you are willing to go to higher debt to cap levels? Lance M. Fritz: Rob? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yes Jeff, I would just remind you that guidance that we have given which we are comfortable with is working towards that debt to EBITDA of 2x and we have said sort of that is marker out there. I think we still have a little bit of a room from the improvement we made on that metric in 2015. So I would expect that we will continue to march forward if you will and as I pointed out, we do expect largely because of a reduction in and we hope to generate stronger cash on the front end but we also have the benefit of lower CAPEX and the benefit of the bonus depreciation that I outlined. So, and we may do debt this year. When we look at that that would not be an unrealistic expectation that you will see us take on additional debt this year. All of that gives us additional -- gives us opportunities to generate stronger free cash flow and gives us opportunities to continue to be opportunistic in the marketplace. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay, and so basically you were saying we have -- I think you are at 1.7 times debt to EBITDA and you are saying we can go to 2x so we can take on a little more debt but more likely we would use the cash flow just to fulfill our obligations? Lance M. Fritz: I don\u2019t think Rob said that. I think he said we are going to generate cash, we have got room in our balance sheet and we will see how the year plays out. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay, thank you. Thank you very much sir. That's all I have. Lance M. Fritz: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions. Ben Hartford : Thanks, Eric could you remind us what your percent of car loads yields are tied to the underlying price of a commodity that it holds? Eric L. Butler: I am not quite sure what you are asking. If you are asking about our pricing strategy and we don\u2019t really talk publically about our pricing strategy. We have historically said we don\u2019t think philosophically that need to tie transportation to slings in commodity markets, you have said that philosophically but we don\u2019t talk about our pricing strategy publically. Ben Hartford : I\u2019d say I guess I am not interested in the strategy specifically, is there a percentage that you provide of car loads that have the yield component that is specifically tied to the price of the underlying commodity? Eric L. Butler: Yes, again that we don\u2019t talk publically about our pricing strategy. We don\u2019t talk about what are -- how our prices developed. Ben Hartford : Okay thank you. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning and thank you. I wanted to talk about mix in terms of length of haul. I\u2019ve seen lengths of haul getting shorter this quarter not just for coal but also chemicals and industrials, is there a structural change going on, what are the drivers of that and where do you see that trend? Thank you very much. Lance M. Fritz: Eric, do you want to talk about that? Eric L. Butler: Our length of haul is down slightly this year and again it is other things that we have been talking about in terms of the mix headwinds with our coal business, some of the mix headwinds with our frac sand business, our long haul grain export business, those are all mixed factors that has impacted our length of haul which was down slightly this year. Lance M. Fritz: And I don\u2019t think we see anything structural that\u2019s some kind of long term trend. Cleo Zagrean : Okay, appreciate that. And then my follow up is tied to one of your comments earlier that you haven't seen the benefit from low oil prices that not just you but many of us were talking about, some kind of silver lining, so what are you hiding from your customers, do you get the sense or that they are postponing decisions just due to uncertainty or they are signaling to you that there is simply lower demand and what do you think might trigger both of the industrial economy that would reflect in your volumes and I know that\u2019s a long question but maybe tied to that if you could discuss the way you focus your business development as a result? Thanks very much. Eric L. Butler: Cleo I\u2019ll focus the answer on your question about not seeing the benefits of low oil. There is multiple moving parts in there. We are seeing capital investment occurring specifically along the Gulf Coast in our chemical franchise. Those investments just haven't yet turned over into operating units and so that\u2019s a matter of time. That\u2019s an end of this year 2017-2018 kind of impact. We are still hopeful for that impact. The other part of it is consumers doing something with the windfall of lower energy cost and that\u2019s where it is really hard to see that showing through in the goods that we shipped for retailers. And their feedback is while maybe services consumption is relatively healthy, goods consumption isn't necessarily showing that. Cleo Zagrean : Okay, so then your business development remains focused in the chemical Gulf Coast footprint? Eric L. Butler: Our business has a wonderful franchise that we\u2019ve talked about. One of the wonderful parts of that is this Gulf Coast franchise. And with low natural gas as a feedstock to many of those manufacturers that\u2019s a benefit to them and we think ultimately will be something we can participate when they increase production. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you very much. Eric L. Butler: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sami Hazboun with Investors Group. Please go ahead with your question. Sami Hazboun : Good morning, thank you for taking my question and I apologize in advance if any of these questions have been asked, I missed part of the call. With respect to the headcount reduction I see that its principally and obviously within the running trades of the TE&Y. Taking that a level above, are there any plans to review the support and/or indirect headcount as a consequence of the volume environment and I have a couple of other questions with specific volume things? Lance M. Fritz: Sami, this is Lance. We in the third quarter of last year and into the fourth quarter we announced and executed an involuntary force reduction on our non-agreement to our management ranks and that has been executed. And then as we look forward, we continue to look for opportunity to get our overall structure sized right for the markets that we are serving. Attrition is our friend in that effort. We typically get an attrition rate of 7% or 8% a year and we will use that to our advantage as and if we need to continue to adjust our overall structural cost. Sami Hazboun : Thanks for that Lance. On the industrial side, with respect to frac sand, did you call out exactly how much of that was down and how much it now composes as a percentage of revenues? Lance M. Fritz: Eric? Unidentified Company Representative  We did in both the prepared remarks and I think in the materials that were sent out, we\u2026 Sami Hazboun : So I just take minerals as mostly frac sand? Eric L. Butler: Yes, the minerals is down 52% and the majority of that is frac sand. Sami Hazboun : Alright, thank you very much gentlemen. Lance M. Fritz: Thank you Sami. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your questions. David Vernon : Hey, good morning. Rob I think you called out $0.11 headwind from fuel in the fourth quarter, have you guys thought about -- I am trying to range what we can expect from the fuel headwind for next year, I mean obviously there is a lot of moving parts to that as well but if you just assume that oil prices kind of stabilize here and we move forward, could you talk a little bit about how big the absolute steel headwind could be in 2016? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Yeah, I didn\u2019t put a number on the full year but it could well be a headwind. I did call out that the first quarter, remember that we had about $0.08 of positive last year. So, we clearly have that as a hurdle facing us as the first quarter continues to play out. Of course how fuel and the timing within an quarter will dictate exactly what that number ends up being year-over-year. But we do see that as a headwind certainly in the first quarter and could continue at some pace throughout the year. David Vernon : But similar to the volume comp issue, you would say that if oil pricing were to stabilize then worst than the fuel impact would be front-end loaded? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Depending on what mix is and where the volumes actually are that's a fair assumption, yes. David Vernon : Okay, and then I guess just as a general question, it seems like on some of the published surcharge tariff tables fuel prices are getting to the point where surcharges actually zero out, is that kind of a correct read to those tables, or do you think that the fuel revenue will still got to be positive as we get through most of 2016? Lance M. Fritz: Rob? Robert M. Knight, Jr: Well as I said those are publically seen and the calculations for those you probably have an accurate calculation. Eric L. Butler: David, I am with Rob, I would just remind you and others that remember we have some 60 plus different surcharge mechanisms that have different starting points, different components, different timing mechanism around them so it is very difficult to draw any kind of a straight line conclusion. But clearly at these low prices some of them are totally new edge. David Vernon : Alright, excellent. Well thanks a lot for your time. It has been a long call and good luck through the next couple of tough quarters on the volume side. Lance M. Fritz: Thank you David. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance M. Fritz: Thank you Rob and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with you again in April. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific first quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, the Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in four of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products down 34% and 10% respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter, with carloads up 7% versus 2015. Our quarterly operating ratio [OR] came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year, as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources, and improving our customer experience. Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric. Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the first quarter, our volume was down 8%, with the gain in automotive and solid chemicals volume more than offset by declines in the other businesses. While we generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges and significant mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 6% on a 4% percent volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7%, as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4%, as animal counts increased and there was less local grain available in our key domestic destination markets in the Mid-South and West. Exports declined 26%, as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to hamper U.S. grain exports. Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. DDGs were down 29%, driven by a decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean meal carloads were down 9%, as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and refrigerated product carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength in demand for import beer. Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter, as a 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments increased 5%, driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate [SAAR] for first quarter automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year levels of 16.7 million vehicles but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million vehicles. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume. Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes excluding crude oil shipments were up 4% in the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8%, due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas, including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes, offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments. Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38%, and Colorado/Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter, as the warm winter, low natural gas prices, and soft exports continue to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2.00 or less for much of the first quarter, PRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the five-year average. Industrial products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year over year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local ground sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling, and increased imports. Demand for construction products, particularly rock and cement, improved 5% in the quarter, driven by favorable weather conditions which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments. Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter, and further declines in sales pushed the number of months it would take to clear shelves of inventory to the highest level since 2009. International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to trans-Pacific market challenges. Slower global trade continues to pressure trans-Pacific rates, resulting in ocean carrier rationalization, and market share losses by Union Pacific-aligned carriers. The return of competitive premium services at P&W also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal. To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag products, strong worldwide crop production suggests little change to the current export environment, and we expect Gulf wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply and U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth. Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million vehicles, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels. Due to declines in the demand for coal, we expect volume to be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions. Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016, with growth in LPG markets and industrial chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft wheat exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year. In industrial products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes, with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market. Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from highway conversions, though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With trans-Pacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivating new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75 [incidents per 200,000 employee-hours]. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risk in the workplace. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 [incidents per 1 million train miles] increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE&Y [Train, Engine & Yard] training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.37 [accidents per 1 million train miles], as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvement in the future. In summary for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment. In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR [American Association of Railroads], velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7% respectively when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews, mostly from alternative work status, as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations. Moving on to resources, driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status has declined slightly from 3,900 [employees] at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we also continue to adjust other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well. While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area where we continue to make progress is in train length. While we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as initiatives led to record terminal productivity, even with a 5% decline in the number of cars switched. Overall, we've continued to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong footing. Moving forward, we expect to further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way toward zero incidents. While near-term uncertainty remains in the current volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce costs. This includes our capital investments, where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix, and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pre-tax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share. Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8% and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015. As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel, and export Ag shipments, partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which was partially offset by pension favorability. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still were realigning our resources and had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume. But as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation is still expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 13% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon. Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, improved cycle times, and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items. Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5-point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, right-sizing our resources to current demand, and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance. Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments, primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter. Taking a look at the balance sheet, our cash balance at quarter end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times, up from 1.7 times at year end, as we continue to target a ratio of less than two times. In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. So that's a recap of the first quarter results. As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year. In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. Overall volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point, for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter, assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mix pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we have experienced in the last couple of quarters. In addition, as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year. We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our Grow to 55 plus Zero initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55% over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance, in productivity, in innovation, in customer experience, and of course in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but ultimately our earnings, our cash flow, and our returns in the years ahead. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Rob. As you've heard from the team, 2016 has brought a continuation of many of the same trends that we experienced throughout most of last year. An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar and soft global economy, and muted domestic retail demand have all contributed to overall market weakness across many of our business lines. And it's likely that many of these themes will be with us for some time. That said, we are stronger coming into this year than we were a year ago. We've improved the fluidity of our network, with service metrics at all-time bests. We also achieved a record industry-best employee safety rate, as we work toward our ultimate goal of zero injuries. It's challenging to do business is such an uncertain market, but we will continue to be agile and adapting to new business environments, making our company more productive, more innovative, and ultimately more successful for the long term. We will continue to leverage the strength and diversity of the Union Pacific franchise to drive new business opportunities, to provide an excellent customer experience, and to generate strong long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess the first is going to be a bigger picture one. You talked about, Rob, I think cost inflation being at around 2% this year. Yet, we have seen some of the core pricing, at least sequentially, trend down to 2.5%. That's not a huge delta for you guys to play with. Where do you see core pricing going forward, and what is pressured sequentially? It looks to me probably to be more Intermodal and coal, but I'd love some commentary on that. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Jason, I would remind \u2013 I know you know this, but I would remind everyone that if you look and compare the results to last year, remember we got about say 0.5 point of legacy pricing that was embedded in full-year results. The previous year and as we called out, the legacy activity is pretty much behind us, so that 2.5% is comparable to something legacy-like, if you will. Having said that, we don't give specific guidance by commodity group in terms of our pricing. In fact, our commitment still is to be an inflation-plus environment. We're going to continue to work as hard as we can providing a quality service product to our customers so we can continue to garner positive price above inflation as we move forward. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. My follow-up question is going to be on Ag volumes specifically, potentially export Ag. The SOLAS [Safety of Life at Sea] weight regulations are coming up here in July. It seems that basically people \u2013 shippers here in the U.S. seemed to be reacting more negatively toward it, particularly some people on the agricultural side. What's UP's view on it, and do you think it could be a potential negative impact, even if it's just a short-term? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: So you're right, the regulations just came out here I think in the last \u2013 clarity on the regulations just came out in the last 30 days. And it really put a lot of the requirements for implementation upon the shipping community, which is part of the reaction that you get. Like most regulations, I think the shipping community will figure out a way to manage to that. And long term, if you look at our Ag business, it really is dependent on the fact that the U.S. still is a great producer. Generally speaking, long term it is in the sweet spot in terms of world competitiveness. We have had wins this year with the strong dollar, but it's in the sweet spot, and the U.S. as a producer will continue to be a good producer. And we as a transportation provider will continue to have the benefits of moving that business. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, so there are no real concerns on your part with SOLAS? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Not for the long-term, no. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Jason. Operator : Your next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I wanted to ask you on the comp and benefits. So you did well with the head count reduction. And I know, Rob, you say that moves with volume. But how would you think sequentially head count changes? And also, is there anything the per-worker? The per-worker change was pretty low, which was notable in contrast to CSX, which saw more of a mid-single-digit increase in that. So I just wondered if you had any thoughts on those two, on how your head count changed and per-worker. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Tom, I would say that first of all on the per-worker, really what drives changes from that from quarter to quarter is largely \u2013 in our case is largely driven by the mix of employees that show up in capital or happen to be working on capital in that quarter or not working on capital. That is generally why you might see swings from one quarter to the next. Because other than that, it's just basically straightforward in terms of the inflation that shows up on the labor line. In terms of our head count going forward, as I said and as we've always said, we're going to continue to squeeze out productivity. Headcount will move as volume does, but not one for one because we are continually focused on identifying continuing productivity initiatives. And I think you saw that certainly in the first quarter with an 11% reduction in the head count. That was good productivity initiatives. But we're not done. The whole theme of the G-to-55 initiative is a focus on continued productivity. So I would expect that trend will continue in terms of moving with volume but offset by productivity results. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, just in terms of pricing, do you think that the pricing environment took a little bit of a step down as you saw on the core price and now it's stable, or would you say that there are pressures that are building a bit further as you look forward on just the contracts that get negotiated through the year? Is that pricing getting worse, or is it just a step down and stable where we are? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Before I turn it over to Eric, this is Lance. Just globally, of course we would prefer an environment like 2014 where volume is growing robustly and there's a lot of demand for our services. That's a more favorable environment to be in. We're in a less favorable environment, but even so, we're still committed to doing what exactly what Rob said, which is pricing for our value, getting a reinvestable return on it, and pricing above inflation. Eric, any more? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: No, I think that's it. I would say we all know that low fuel prices are allowing trucks to be plentiful. They're very tough competitors. Sluggish retail sales is a headwind to the economy. But within that, we think we have a great value proposition, and we're going to continue to price towards our value proposition. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, well thanks for the time, and nice job on the cost side. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe Rob or Cameron, as you think about the drivers of productivity in the drive to 55% as an operating ratio, can you help us frame where that's going to come from? Is it the application of technology? Is it business process? And I know it's a broad question, but I guess some investors have had a little bit of feedback around where is this going to come from. And I'm just wondering if you can give us some color in terms of the big broad-brush strokes where you think this productivity can come from in the business? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Cam, let's start with you. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Okay. We mentioned train size earlier in the presentation. Every commodity group that we have has headroom for additional train size productivity. And we feel very good about our progress. We've made record train sizes in every commodity with the exception of coal, which was fairly optimized for a number of years in a row, and we'll do that again this year. Variable costs in every department within the operating team is a very big initiative for us, transportation, mechanical and engineering. And initiatives like recrew rate, where we've made enormous progress over the last 18 months coming down to record recrew performance. So those are some examples. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I also want to add \u2013 let's not shorthand, when Rob is talking about Grow to 55 and Zero, productivity isn't just about cutting heads. It's more predominantly about doing things more efficiently, getting more out of our assets, getting more out of a gallon of fuel. And the growth side is equally important, as Eric and his commercial team, in the context of all the headwinds we see on the energy side of the world, growing all the other commodities where we have opportunity, and there's lots of that opportunity. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: David, I promise we will not have three responses to every question here, but this is near and dear to all of our hearts. And I would just add to the discussion that Cam and Lance have had is that we're looking at every stone that we can turn over in the company. Cam obviously talked heavily about the operations, which is where the big dollars are and the big opportunities are, but we're not leaving it at that. And Lance talked about the growth opportunities. But aside from that, we're challenging the entire organization, even the administrative groups, to turn over every stone of looking for additional opportunities to be more efficient than ever before. And to your question, yes, technology, where it can enable that, whether it's in core operations or in a support activity, we are certainly looking to leverage that even further. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent. And then maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about some of the stranded asset issues that may come with the coal network running at obviously levels that we've never seen before, at least in the last 10 or 15 years, how much of a headwind should we expect in terms of some assets being stranded out there or costs being stranded out there, with the decline of coal? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: David, this is Rob. I would say that that's not the case in our network. Again, if you look at \u2013 we don't have stranded assets. We don't envision there will be stranded assets. Because if you look at it again, using coal as the obvious example, we've still got the lines going up to the PRB mines. Those lines, while less volume traveling over them perhaps right now than maybe at their peak, they are still the same lines that we've enjoyed. So we don't have a situation. Now having said that, we're going to squeeze to be as productive as we can on our asset base. You see that in our locomotives and certainly our head count related to that. But as it relates to stranded assets, I don't see that as an issue for us. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent, thanks a lot for the time, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to ask a couple high-level questions. Eric, you mentioned the strong dollar still a headwind on grain, crudes, and excess inventories in that market. But it's come off from the peak, the dollar has clearly had a nice run for a long time. How long do you think it needs to stay at this level, or roughly how much lower do you think it needs to go before you start to see some relief? And I guess what would be the first place you would expect to see that? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: I'm not a central banker, but I would say the dollar is still very high in any relative sense. It has dropped a little from the peak, but it still is very high. And as you know, dollars impact the competitiveness of U.S. exports across the board. So whether it's Ag, whether it's things like steel, whether it's things like our iron or metals business or other commodities business, it impacts all of those things. And so I don't have any prediction of how much the dollar needs to fall. It still is very high in any relative historical sense. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But to clarify, it sounds like you're not seeing anything at this stage? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: The dollar is still a headwind. The strong dollar is still a headwind to U.S. exports. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then to follow up on oil, it's again another macro factor, clearly been moving off the lows. How much upside do you think can be to the frac sand business? Are you starting to see any signs of activity there? I know you had another tough quarter on tough comps. You mentioned some regional sourcing that's starting to work its way into the business. But are you starting to at least hear some more optimism that completions would start to move forward here and get some more sand down the wells? Thanks. Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: I think the public numbers still show drilling rigs down about 45% or 49%, 50%. So, Eric, there's not a lot of drilling activity that has picked back up with the slight bump up in fuel. Certainly when the drilling activity picks back up, we would expect to participate in that in the various markets that we operate in. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: The good news on that is, the shale energy producers have done a tremendous job in getting their own cost structures in line and getting productivity as they had experience with this new approach to drilling. And so the strike price for when activity picks up is lower than it was three or four or five years ago, but we're still not at that point. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. I appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, good morning. Rob, just following up on Tom's question before, you talked about the cost per employee coming down a bit. Would you expect that to increase with incentive comp? Or you mentioned pension reductions. Can those outweigh it? Can you just walk through the pension savings and incentive comp impacts as we move forward through the year? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: I wouldn't anticipate a material change or much of a change at all in the pension. And incentive comp for us, Ken, is not a big mover because we don't have a wide-based plan that affects a wide percentage of our employees. So if you boil it down, the big driver is going to be \u2013 again, I would use that 2% labor inflation number that we expect for the full year. And again, the timing of that can change quarter to quarter depending on how many employees are actively involved in capital or not involved in capital. That's really going to be what changes that number going forward. So I don't see any big changes. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So nothing that materially changes the productivity gains you saw in the quarter? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: No, not as it relates to the comp per employee. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, Eric, just thinking about Intermodal, obviously given the pressures you talked about, maybe one more to throw out at you with the Panama Canal opening up soon. I know that over the past few years, you and Lance have thrown out that you don't expect much change. But as you see plans and new teaming up amongst the container liners that's going on, is there any thought of any shift of capacity given the impact of the port strike a year ago and thoughts on how that distributes the Intermodal volumes? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Ken, there are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and there are a lot of ins and outs. I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time. A couple of the key factors we always look at is that West Coast port entry still is the fastest option to get to the Eastern markets, usually by two weeks. Another factor is with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TEUs [20-foot Equivalent Units] on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal. So I think as you look at this trans-Pacific rationalization, there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal. I think the West Coast ports still will remain a very strong, viable competitor. And fundamentally we're not changing our perspective and our outlook that we've had over the last couple years. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, I appreciate the insight. Thanks for the time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. So first question I wanted to ask, there's a lot of noise in the volume numbers right now between volatile comps, the impact of flooding, and what's going on in coal, and it's pretty tough to get a feel for the underlying demand environment. From your perspective through the first three or four months of the year, what's your view on the demand environment and the economy relative to where your outlook was at the start of the year? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Eric, do you want to take a stab at that? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: So clearly, as Rob said earlier, the coal side was a lot softer than what we anticipated. Again, warmest winter on weather, we did not expect these low natural gas prices. The shale impact is significant. But if you set aside the shale impact, the energy, the coal impact, you do have some variability going on in terms of retail sales that is probably a little softer than what we anticipated. But if you look at net-net everything else, I think it's pretty solid growth and aligned with what we expected and aligned with the slowly strengthening economy. So you have a retail sales, international Intermodal market issue. You've got a shale/coal energy market issue. But if you look at everything else, I think it's pretty aligned and slowly strengthening. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Eric. And as a follow-up, one of the big discrepancies between your year-to-date volume performance and your Western competitor is coming in Intermodal. So I'm just curious if you're seeing more competitive pricing dynamics and any market share shift. Or is there another explanation for this discrepancy? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Yes, Justin, I think it's as I said in my prepared comments; that if you look at the international Intermodal side of the business and all of the rationalization that's going on there with the steamship carriers and the alliance changes and some of the mergers, that clearly has had more of an impact on our book of business based on the shippers that we certainly have been aligned with vis-\u00e0-vis our Western competitor. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: And, Justin, taking a step back, when you think about Intermodal, you break out international Intermodal and domestic, we still are quite bullish on domestic Intermodal over the long run. There is still a rich opportunity to take trucks off the highway, and we think we're going to be able to grow that product for the foreseeable future. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, just more a broader question as it relates to CapEx. I know if I go back to 2000 \u2013 2005 timeframe, your volumes today are relatively flat, but your CapEx budget is up 100%. It's doubled, so you're spending twice as much to handle the same level of traffic. I know you've layered in PTC [Positive Train Control]. I know given the long-lived nature of the assets that there's inflation, but I'm just curious. Is it time for you and your rail peers to rethink the brackets or the goalposts in terms of percentage of revenues you're spending on CapEx? I know you've got to take a long 10-year \u2013 20-year view, where most people in the market take a one-month or two-month view. But I'm just curious. In a slower growth environment, which seems to be stubbornly persistent, you took $600 million down year over year, which is impressive. Is it time to rethink more broadly what capital is required to run these railroads? Thanks. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks for the question, Matt. As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes, and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which... Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Right. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: ...full year last year was a $300 million or a $390 million number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion, and in these days we're spending more like a $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels. Having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first three things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume, what's that environment look like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns? In my mind's eye, you're still going to see us spend down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity. And you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GPMs. Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: I appreciate the thoughtful answer, and just one follow-up. I'm looking for a silver lining in what is otherwise a choppy volume environment. I was surprised at the strength in industrial chems, up 16%, just given that they historically have had \u2013 rail chemical traffic has had such a high correlation with economic expansion. I was wondering if you could perhaps just put some additional color there given that strength. Was that share driven? Was that new customer driven? Just some greater clarity there would be extremely helpful. Thank you. Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: So as we regularly say, we are continuing to focus on business development. And we have a huge number of business development initiatives underway across the board, which are really overshadowed by the coal and the shale fall-off and some of the rationalization we're seeing in international Intermodal. If you look at our chemicals business, the Gulf Coast franchise, while many of those plastics expansions will not come on till next year, as we've talked about in the past, we still have lots of opportunities in terms of LPG growth. Mexico energy reform, there's a lot of growing interest in terms of moving products there, and we are working on a number of different initiatives with that. And so there is general economic strength that we're seeing in our industrial products business in terms of construction coming back, housing coming back. Chemicals has the benefit of plastics going to the automotive industry as you see automotive sales. And so there's a slowly strengthening economy out there and we're doing a lot of business development to go after it, which again is being overshadowed by just the huge volume numbers for coal and shale and the other headwinds we have. Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood, thank you very much for the time and detail. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, good morning. Given everything that's happening with coal, similar to what your Eastern peers have done in the past few years, are you having to explore potentially changing contracts with your customers and moving more towards a fixed to variable structure? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Eric, do you want to handle that? Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: So, Allison, as you know, we have a standard answer where we don't really talk about specific contract negotiations. I will say we negotiate aggressively and assertively, and we're in a very competitive environment. And for any particular contract negotiation, we probably have dozens if not hundreds of terms that we're negotiating. And like always, as markets change and we look to be competitive, we evaluate a bunch of those terms and conditions and what works for us and works for our customer base. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up question, if we look a little bit out to the future and see volumes will eventually come back to the network, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the operating leverage and earnings power of the company, just in light of the fact that you've taken out a significant amount of costs over the last few quarters? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: So as you just lined up, volume is our friend. We're looking forward to the point where we're growing on the top line because it does make it easier to drop that to the bottom line. Having said that, in the place we are right now, we're in the process of getting our overall structure to match where our markets are today. And then from that point moving forward, we'll continue to be aggressive on our productivity, on our efficiency, on our business development, and generally that model is very attractive when we grow. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good morning. I wanted to touch a little bit on the flooding. You haven't mentioned it on the call. I just wanted to get a sense if you can quantify any impact, if it was material, both from a cost and maybe from a volume standpoint if maybe we see a little bit of lost volumes come back a bit in 2Q. Just give us a sense of how to think about that. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Chris, this is Rob. It was yeoman's work by the operating team because it was a significant challenge for them, but they did a fabulous job. I would say that the impact to us was less than $0.01 in terms of EPS for the quarter. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on mix. So mix obviously improved from the fourth quarter, and it feels like it was a little bit less bad than maybe some were thinking for the first quarter despite the fact that some of the bulk commodity groups were down pretty significantly. As you think about the rest of the year, how can this trend? Is the first quarter likely to be the low water mark in terms of the headwind for mix? How do we think about that going forward? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Chris, this is Rob. You know we don't give guidance on mix. And the reason we don't is because we are in so many different markets, which we're very proud of in terms of the diversity of our network. There are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and there's mix even within each of the commodity groups. Having said that, you're right. We are coming off of unusually high negative mix challenges, and we do think our best look at the balance of the year is that will moderate. Again, we're at high water marks here, I would hope, at 2.5% and certainly last quarter's 4% negative impact on mix I would hope is an all-time high water mark. But we do think our best guess is that's going to moderate, but it's difficult to actually put any finer point on it. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Chris. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to take a longer-term view here and ask you about coal. Obviously another step down in the next couple of quarters. But when you look to 2017, is this a market that can be flat or even up next year, or what's your view there? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Let me take a stab at that, Ravi. So the way we think about coal is it's facing a large number of headwinds right now : low natural gas prices as an alternative; pretty significant inventory overhang on piles right now; and a weak electricity generating market, some driven by weather. So as those headwinds persist, coal is going to continue to have some difficulty. We're going to have to chew up some of this excess inventory before we see coal demand really strengthen. What it might look like two, three, four, five years from now, we still think it's a pretty important part of the overall electricity generating base the United States. It's not going back, we don't think, to where it was four or five years ago. And you can make an argument either way, that it strengthens a bit or that it might decline a bit. Our best guess is we're probably in the relative sphere where it's going operate other than the really significant headwinds that we're facing in this particular timeframe. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And as a follow-up, going back to the flooding, again, we heard there was a lot of cooperation between a number of rails to get everyone out of that mess. But just generally talking about the competitive environment, what are you seeing out there in terms of some of the actions that some of your peers might be taking? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I think if you're asking specific to the floods, we did a great job of making sure our customers had alternatives and satisfying their needs and keeping them well informed. If you're asking in terms of the overall operating environment... Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: ...we are in a competitive environment. We compete every day for every piece of business that we enjoy. And we compete on the basis of providing our customers the best experience they're going to get in the marketplace, and everything we do every day is oriented towards making that happen. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So a few things I wanted to clarify. Rob, any coal liquidated damages in the quarter, and are you expecting any for the year? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Scott, for us I'd say minor, and I would anticipate that it will be minor for the balance of the year. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So that's just not a number that you guys disclose? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Correct. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Your point, Rob, about there was more capital than expense employees in the quarter \u2013 I think that was your point \u2013 is that something that is just a first-quarter event, or does that continue all year where we see comp per employee, because of that, less than the 2% wage inflation you talked about? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Scott, the point I was trying to make on that, number one, you can always have those swings depending on what capital projects are going on, but that was more of a sequential comment. Generally speaking, you would start to ramp up some of your capital projects in the first quarter that perhaps you weren't running as you finished the fourth quarter. So that was more of a comment, this particular go-round, relative to the sequential look. Year over year in the first quarter, not as material of an impact, but that can change from time to time. But I think if you look at it, again, the first quarter was pretty clean in my view. When you look year over year in terms of 11% head count reduction, really is representative of very solid, outstanding productivity performance. And of course, remember the year before we had our share of challenges. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : I guess I'm just thinking from a comp per employee, because you talked about inflation of 2%, and comp per employee was down 1%. I'm just trying to understand if that's a number that can continue the rest of the year. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: I wouldn't give guidance on that. I think probably the best way to think about it is that 2% inflation generally speaking should look like the guidance we're getting on the labor inflation line, which would be closer to 2%. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. If I can just ask one more, Eric, maybe can you let us know? Where are coal stockpiles now relative to targets? And if you think back to last cycle, how long does it take for the stockpiles to come down? Is it one good weather season, is it two, three? I don't know. Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: The actual numbers I think are 108 days, which is about 41 days above, call it a five-year average \u2013 and I think no, 41 days above last year. And how long it takes to come down just depends on all the factors we've talked about. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, look, I believe at some point we're going to see some recovery in volumes. I guess we all hope that, right? But in the meantime, as you go through these cost reduction efforts and align resources with the carload volumes and that type of thing, how long can you do that before you get some ramp up in carloads and protect the profitability of the railroad? Obviously, profitability was down in the quarter, but you did a nice job of protecting the OR and that kind of thing. How long can you continue that until you run out of cost reduction initiatives and start to cut into the muscle of the organization? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: John, we can do it for as long as is necessary. We've demonstrated that we understand how to use attrition as our friend, how to use initiatives like Grow to 55 and Zero. We know how to get our cost structure right. We're in the middle of doing that and we're going to continue to do it. My expectation is that we don't have to do that forever because I do expect us at some point to start growing the top line. We're in a unique environment right now with a lot of headwinds. Some of those headwinds represent structural shift, like in coal, where a portion of that book of business is probably permanently reduced. But in the big scheme of things, at some point those headwinds abate, we start growing again. And even in that environment, we're still focused on making sure that we have the structure right, that we have our costs right, and that we're constantly looking for efficiency. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, all right. And then secondly, Rob, you commented in your presentation about a significant increase in the cash balances because of the debt issuance. You've reduced the CapEx budget a little bit, which I would imagine probably juices the cash flow a little bit. Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess with rail M&A off the table, there's no real need to be hoarding cash for some kind of move in that arena? What do you think the plan is on use of cash going forward? Is there any alteration? Should we expect any acceleration in share buyback, just given the cash balances at this point? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: John, I would say no. I wouldn't read into the fact that we happened to finish the quarter with a high cash balance as a change in anything we're doing. It's going to be the balanced approach. We need the cash for working capital, for taxes, for dividends. And we'll continue to be, as we have been, opportunistic on the share buyback as we move forward. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right, very good. Thanks for the time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask one on grain. Because there's so much in storage, you could make case that there's potential upside in the back half just on the basis that some will have to move to make room for this year's harvest. But you still seem pretty cautious, and I'm just curious if that's because it's early in the season or something else. Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: This is Eric, Cherilyn. There is a lot of grain in storage. There is about 200 million bushels that were carried out from last year. I think the USDA estimates are that can grow by another 500 million bushels based on the number of acres that are being planted and the types of yields that are expected. So there is a lot of grain out there. We believe that eventually it has to move. And so we are certainly optimistic that when it does move, we're going to get our fair share of that, and it will move. It's just right now, U.S. grain is not competitive on world markets. The strong dollar is an issue. There are other issues in terms of really good crops in other places, growing regions around the world. But we do think it will ultimately will move, and we're going get our fair share of it when it does. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of the locomotives that you've got in storage, are any of those potential lease turn-back candidates, or are you comfortable with that as a surge fleet? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Cam, do you want to start by talking about locomotives in storage? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: We have a really good mix of high-horsepower and low-horsepower in storage. And particularly on the low-horsepower fleet, as we look out over the next three to four years, there are some very nice lease return-backs that we will do. And we're very confident we can hold our low-horsepower fleet size and return those leases without any impact to our customers. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. That's all for me. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting my question in. I know it's been a long call. But, Lance or Rob, you guys did guide to an improved operating ratio this year. So can you just talk about the confidence that you have in achieving that, especially with volume down 10% in 2Q, as well as talk a little bit more about the fuel headwind that you were discussing in 1Q? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I'll let Rob talk about the fuel headwind. From the standpoint of operating ratio, we wouldn't be reaffirming it and talking about it if we didn't have confidence and faith in achieving it. We believe that given any reasonable outlook, we are going to improve our operating ratio this year. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: I would just add to that, Brandon, that clearly we'd rather have positive volume. And just as a reminder, we did guide that we think full-year volumes will be down mid-single digits. That's a challenge. But to Lance's point, what we're expressing here is confidence in our ability to continue to be squeezing out productivity initiatives and continue to price appropriately in the marketplace. On the fuel, the guidance we're giving on fuel is that while it was a $0.10 headwind in the first quarter, largely driven by the $0.08 benefit the previous first quarter last year, we think that's going to moderate. If fuel prices stay where they are, our expectation would be that that headwind will moderate, largely because we lap the fall-off in fuel from the previous year. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got you. So that was just the year-on-year impact \u2013 or the lag impact from last year. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: That's exactly the quarter-over-quarter look, yes. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, and just one real quick one for the model. You did do a debt offering in the quarter. Where should your run rate interest expense be going forward? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: I would say probably comparable to what we saw in the first quarter. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, all right. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. These go ahead with your questions. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Cameron, thanks for the detail on some of the initiatives behind the Grow to 55. But of the 45 projects that you guys have specifically identified, how many of those have kicked off or are going to kick off this year? And then what's the cadence of the remaining projects over the next couple years? I just want to try to understand the pipeline of opportunities there. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.: Absolutely. Within the operating department team, we have 12 projects that we've identified that we kicked off late 2014 and into 2015. Many of those projects are gaining very, very good traction into 2016, and we have a couple of others lined up for the end of 2016 going into 2017. So they're broad-based. They're well measured. We feel very confident, to an earlier question, that when we identify one of these productivity projects that we can hold that productivity as volume comes back to us so we have great leverage out into the future. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's great. And then, Rob, my follow-up, there just remains a lot of concern over there about the impact of mix, the decline in coal, and what it's doing to the holistic margin profile of the railroad. So I totally get it that you don't give margins by commodity. But how should we think about the stratifications of margins by commodity maybe say versus past? So have they tightened over the past couple years, meaning are they much closer to corporate average today versus maybe a more disparate profile in the past, or is that an oversimplification? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: As you know, we don't break it out by commodity, but clearly the mix that we've seen the last few quarters is a challenge. I'm particularly proud of the fact that with reductions in volume and the headwind that we faced in the mix, we have continued to drive outstanding operating ratio performance. So that's the focus. Irrespective, you've heard me say this many times. We're going to play the hand that the economy deals us. We're not going to use the challenge that we're facing right now of a mix headwind as an excuse not to make continued margin improvements, and that's what we're all about. That's what driving our initiative of G55. That's what's still driving our plus or minus 60% operating ratio by full-year 2019 focus. We have to live in that world. But clearly, those challenges that we faced here on the mix have been challenges. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's great and good job on the costs, thanks. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Obviously, you've done an admirable job in what is a fairly high fixed cost business at managing costs and bringing them down aggressively in line with \u2013 or almost in line with the rate in which you've seen revenues fall. Help me think about this, though. If we see further volume declines, can you be as productive? In other words, I'm assuming that as we furlough 1,400 locomotives, you're not furloughing the youngest, most efficient locomotives. You're furloughing the oldest, most in need of maintenance, least efficient locomotives. So as we make further cuts, is it realistic to expect that you can be as effective in your cost control as you have been so far, or am I thinking about that incorrectly? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: No, it is reasonable to expect us to continue to be able to be effective at adjusting our cost structure, even in the face of further volume declines. Now we're not saying we anticipate things get worse from where they are right now. But if they were to, we have the ability to continue to adjust our cost structure. We've demonstrated, to this point, there are still levers to be pulled. We'd much prefer to grow, but we will pull those levers as we need to. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : But will cost cutting be as productive in the future as it has been in the past? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: From my perspective, there are ample opportunities to be more efficient everywhere I look on the railroad. We will continue to be able to generate productivity from that perspective. And as we have to take larger chunks of cost out, we'll continue to evaluate that and do that effectively as well. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Fantastic. Thank you, gentleman. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you very much and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific today. We look forward to talking to you again in July. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Presentation : Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin. Lance Fritz : Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal, Intermodal and industrial products all down double-digits. Agricultural products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year. As positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes. While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service, and improving our safety performance. Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric. Eric Butler : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 11% with gains in Ag products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volume sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June. While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger than expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico. Wheat shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher quality Canadian wheat. Grain product shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels. Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food in refrigerated carloads grew 2%, as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets, resulting from abundant truck supply. Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by 2% decrease in volume and 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue in all were negatively impacted by mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car then finished vehicles. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 10% driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific plants and contract changes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles; however, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new over the road conversions. Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remained strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments, resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic Ag markets. Strength in other areas including growth in industrial chemicals partially offset these declines. We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, chemicals volume was up 1% in the quarter. Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado Utah rail shipments were down both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar. PRB coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down six days from May, but still 35 days above the five year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which was 47% higher than what was burned in May. Industrial products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 32% for the -- in the quarter. Frac sand shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from low oil prices and market shifts to short-haul brown sand alternatives. Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar. Construction products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity. Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year. Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow trans-Pacific trade and a volume loss by UPMI containership carriers. To wrap-up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we soar towards the end of the second quarter. In Ag products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations, and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments. Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market, as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in import beer is expected throughout 2016. Moving to autos, recent economic forecasts suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over the road conversions. We expect low gasoline prices will help sustain demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production and sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, export demand, and weather. We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and industrial chemicals volumes will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market. In industrial products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals rock volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing market should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes. Finally in Intermodal, we expect international lines will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges, and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation. On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provides opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron Scott : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of zero incidents. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investments helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who did not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this was a step back from last year's solid performance, we're confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings where incidents were more likely to occur. Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships, and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive improvements in the future. Moving to network performance, after experiencing relatively mild winter weather conditions to start off the year, flooding events in the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate variability in the network, but it's something that we are accustomed to dealing with. Utilizing the diverse strengths of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible; temporary utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews as our employees worked diligently to restore operations. These efforts kept the impact to a minimum including the delays of disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This includes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees, or 7%, versus the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter of 2015. While adjusting our resource to demand will always be a key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. While we're unable to overcome the volume decline within the scheduled Intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. The fluidity and productivity our network has also reflected in the second quarter lower re-crew rate. A failure cost incurred when the first crew has inefficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed. In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience. And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce costs. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom-line to increase utilization of existing assets. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Knight : Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year, significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact of weather on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June. The total operating expense impact from these two events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions. Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year. Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion; down 19% versus 2015 while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share. Now turning to our topline, freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11% and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.06 headwind earnings in the second quarter versus last year. Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers and coming into the second quarter, diesel fuel prices were below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have edged up. Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the two-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected. The primary drivers of mix this quarter were significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%. Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%. Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%. Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter, our employee counts declined 12%, or almost 6,000, as a result of lower volumes and our G55 + 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total work force levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016. And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes, as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon. Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets. Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items. Turning to our operating ratio, the second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by two points in the quarter. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half. Taking a look at the balance sheet, our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year end, as we continue to target a ratio of less than two times. For the first six months of the year, we have brought back about 16.3 million shares, totaling over $1.3 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. So, that's a recap of the second quarter results. Looking out to the rest of the year, we expect volume will continue to be a challenge, even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so. And coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year. We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range, depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely we would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with volume reduction in this range, we will of course continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer-term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. On the capital front, we're still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we are still working through the details. We are diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well underway and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months. We're confident that our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As you've heard from everyone here this morning, we continued to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups. A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports, and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year. That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen, as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related business. We're also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions. Beyond the impact of the current macro environment, we are implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises six primary value tracks and you've heard these themes woven throughout our comments today. These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity, both designed to improve our work processes so we can make the most out of what we have. Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach, and our proprietary technology. And, of course, our G55 and Zero initiatives cut across all six of these tracks. In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength in the communities that we serve, and solid returns for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey good morning, and thanks for taking my call. Lance Fritz : Good morning Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : I just had a couple of quick questions, one on coal and Chris the weather and natural gas inventories are affecting demand there. Can you see anything from -- pressure from renewable energy specifically from wind, is that continuing to take a little bit of share here and we've seen the production tax credits -- investment tax credits were extended at the end of last year. So, I'll be curious to see if you're seeing the impact your utility customers? Eric Butler : Yeah, Brian, this is Eric. So, you're correct, there is continued expansion of wind capability kind of in the energy space throughout the country. Most of wind has to be backed up by some other source of power because you can't depend on it completely as you know. It is not a material year-over-year impact for us in terms of our coal burned or coal space. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And then just one quick one on Intermodal and clearly you've outlined some of the challenges on the international side. Just wondering if the safety [Indiscernible] mandate hit constant volatility maybe on the volume side as we heard some shippers were moving volumes ahead of the July 1st mandate. So curious to see if you have seen any of that which would perhaps be weighing on volumes now and if you had to make any adjustments for the on duck rail to satisfy that weight certification requirements when that rolled out earlier this month? Eric Butler : Yeah, Brian the sole-less [ph] thing as you said was effective July 1. As you know the shippers are responsible for certifying all of those weights. As far as we can tell that has not been impact on the supply chain, so it is not been an impact on us and we can't tell yet any significant impact on the full supply chain. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks Eric. Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions/ Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Lance Fritz : Morning Scott. Scott Group : So, Rob, why don't you just follow-up on your comments about the operating ratio that you don't necessarily expect improvement this year. I get that as a full year comment maybe can you talk about the second half of the year as the volume declines or moderating, do you think that margin improvement in the second half of the year is possible? And then just with that I don't think I heard a guidance for headcount sequentially in 3Q if you have any color there. Robert Knight : Yeah, Scott, a couple of comments. One, yes my commentary on the operating ratio was a full year comment because as you know we have previously said our expectation earlier in the year was call it mid-single-digit volume decline for the full year and with that assumption improvement year-over-year on the operating ratio and with the revised volume guidance for the full year what we're saying there or signaling there is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our margins, but the year-over-year improvement looks less likely at this stage of the game. But having said that, that does imply -- our guidance on volume does imply and our guidance on our commitment to improving our margins does imply that we expect to making continued improvement from here on our operating ratio and not only this year but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019 60 plus or minus. On the headcount question, yeah, we had very good performance as it relates to headcount in the second quarter. Volumes, obviously, play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending on what volumes actually are combined with of our focus on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume and our expectations from this going forward backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today that would suggest that headcounts will move up, but not one for one. And by the time we finish the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend upon exactly how the volumes play out. Scott Group : Okay. And Rob, so you\u2019re not making comments about third or fourth quarter operating ratio year-over-year? Robert Knight : I am not. Other than we're very focused and expect particularly with improving volume that we'll continue to improve where we are today. Scott Group : Okay. And then just quickly on the CapEx side, I think maybe if you could get to 15% of revenue or so next year is that something that we can expect for not just 2017, but for kind of a few years just given the excess locomotives and the lack of the need to buy locomotives for probably two, three, four years or something? Lance Fritz : Yes, Scott, this is Lance. The basis for that guidance is as we look out into out years, call it the planning horizon, we think demand on our part for new locomotives is going to be pretty muted and we think PTC drops off to a very low level if any. And you just account for those two line items in this year's capital plan and it\u2019s a significant chunk of capital. So, that's the underlying thought process behind moving more towards 15% as opposed to 16% to 17%. Scott Group : It sounds like it should be more than 17, it should be more ongoing. Lance Fritz : Yeah. It's our planning horizon. So, I would say you're right, it's beyond 17. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sequential downtick in the core pricing number and whether that was driven at all by contract renewals or changes in the inflation indices. And then do you think we're at a cyclical low point there? Eric Butler : Yeah. So, Allison, this is Eric. There was some minus sequential softening in [Indiscernible]. We think the 2% price that we turned in is positive and it continues to be above inflation, but it also is reflective in of market that we have there is surplus capacity in the market on all modes of traffic. We continue with our strategy. We continue to price to the value that we bring and we think we're bringing a substantial value and we're improving our value and we continue to take as you said in the past a targeted market-based approach on pricing. If you look in the future, you do see capacity tightening across all modes of traffic and we continue to be positive about our ability to price our value the future. Allison Landry : Okay. Rob I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that your expectations for full year inflation was about one and a half. Is that the right way to think about inflation in the second quarter, in other words spreads about 50 bps which is similar to Q1? Robert Knight : Allison, that's directionally correct, but I would just kind of remind everyone while inflation is low against historical levels, we aren\u2019t really -- it's not mechanically terms of how we price, but, yes, I think directionally those are probably not bad numbers. Allison Landry : Okay. And then just maybe a question on coal, you mentioned the higher burn rates in June with obviously pretty hot summer. When we think about that versus the elevated inventory levels, do you think sort of the normal sequential increase in the 2H versus 1H for coal carloads similar to historical levels which I think is somewhere in the high single-digit range? Lance Fritz : Allison, I don't think we can give an outlook on kind of what sequential changes we'll see going forward. We do expect the inventory levels to go down the burn rate is increased as you have hot weather. You are seeing volumes grow and I think we'll see those trends continuing. I don't think we could be any more precise than that. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, thanks. I wanted to ask a question about mix. So, I think mix was flat in the quarter and has been improving the last couple of quarters. I guess just wanted to get a sense, I think the outlook for the full year a quarter or so ago was -- I think continue to state relatively negative, but maybe eases as the year goes on. Can you give us any thoughts Rob maybe how to think about that as we go into the third and fourth quarter coal getting all better, maybe grain getting a little bit better? Is it possible to see a positive? Robert Knight : Chris, I mean as you know we don't give guidance on mix because of the moving parts and I would just say as you've heard me say many times, I think that's basically true for our franchise because we have such a diverse set of business mixes that we in fact are playing in not only at a macro level, but mix within mix at the commodity level. So, as a result we can't and don't give specific guidance. But we did say we knew certainly the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year were unusually high given some of the mix and we thought it would start to moderate throughout the year and it has. So, I would expect that I wouldn't give guidance that will be plus or minus, but I think it was reasonable to assume that look sort of more normal if you will could be plus, could be minus as the year plays out depending on actually what volumes move. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. But generally speaking some of those heavier bulk commodities generally are positive to the mix dynamic? Robert Knight : Generally, but again, Chris, as I think you know and others perhaps as well, you can have mix within mix. So, using our example of coal you can have a mix of positive or negative even just within the coal line. Chris Wetherbee : Of course, that's helpful, that definitely makes sense. I wanted to ask you about the competitive dynamic particularly on the Intermodal side but generally competitive pricing in the West. I know you guys compete every day for the business that you win, but over the course of the last couple of quarters, just wanted to get a sense of sort of where that -- how that competition has been sort of shaking out, particularly on the domestic Intermodal side which I think was down again this quarter. I just want to see how that's kind of playing out? Has it gotten any more difficult to win business from a rail perspective as opposed to trucks, we obviously know what's going on with the truck pricing, but just want to get a sense of how that's playing out? Robert Knight : Yeah, Chris I think you said it right, we compete vigorously every day for business we have strong real competitor, strong truck competitors. We have strong water barge shipping competitors and you're exactly right we compete vigorously. We do think we have a strong value proposition and we think that with that strong value proposition we can compete effectively on that value proposition and price for the value that we're providing to the marketplace. As I said earlier you're seeing capacity tighten and many of those modes and we think that's positive for the competitive environment, but, yes, we compete vigorously every day. Chris Wetherbee : And that tightening is that a current event or something you would expect maybe in 2017, just want to make sure I'm clear about that? Robert Knight : So, as you go forward you certainly know what's happening in terms of the trucking regulations that are out there like electronic logs and the impact that, that's going to have. I think you have seen in the last couple of months a number of large trucking companies as part of their public pronouncements discuss what they see with capacity trends and their predictions about tightening. You see kind of in the ship space some of the consolidations that are going on. So, I think it is kind of across all volumes. Of course you see rail volumes picking up. So, I think across all modes, you see that tightening. Chris Wetherbee : That's helpful. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. The first question I wanted to ask was on your optimism for the second half in grain. Up to now you've been a little bit cautious about being optimistic in that segment. Just given your view on storage in the U.S., I just wondered if you could update is there in your thoughts. Eric Butler : Hopefully -- this is Eric, hopefully, I was sounding more balanced than optimistic, but if you look at storage right now, there is -- storage is about 30% higher, storage of all types, grain, beans et cetera than what the five year average has been. And then if you look at the crop there was something like 6 million more acres of corn planted this year and it's still dependent upon kind of the weather and the harvest, but right now it looks like it's going to be pretty decent yields from the current crop. And so if you look at the pretty decent yields from the current crop if you look at the high storage levels on a historical basis, if you look at some of the challenges -- in particular South American crops that have had, it suggests that there's going to be opportunity to move grain in the second half of the year at a higher run rate than what we saw in the first half. Cherilyn Radbourne : Right. And in terms of thinking about how much of your Ag products segment is really sensitive to the size of the crop. Should we be thinking about that grain sub-segment or are grain products movements also very sensitive to their size of the crop? Eric Butler : Grains clearly -- our grain products are from the standpoint. The driver in grain products is ethanol is a large portion of that and then next kind of the soybean meals. And so those are also very sensitive to the crops and basically the crop pricing and whether or not ethanol will be in the money. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. That's all for me. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, morning everyone. You said earlier that you don't necessarily price -- set your price to be 50 basis points above inflation. Can you just talk about what might be any structure drivers that kind of keeps that margin and prevents pricing from closing the gap further to inflation? Lance Fritz : Ravi, this is Lance. When you think about pricing for us you start at the highest level which is we try to provide excellent customer service and excellent experience which generates value for our customers when we price for that. In that context, we're constantly looking to make a reasonable return, so that it's a re-investable piece of business. And then we have the reality of the dynamics of other competitive modes or competition. You put that altogether and that's what informs our ability to price. So, when you think about it going forward, you know markets that have less modal capacity, markets that are robust and growing strongly those are better markets to price in than not. But that generally informs our pricing scheme. Ravi Shanker : Okay. And I had a follow-up on coal as well. You touched upon this in response to pervious question. But the 3Q coal outlook looked somewhat soft given the step up in the burn; I'm wondering if you think that that's not sustainable or why that would not -- why inventories will not be drawn down further. And also when you look out into 2017, there's some folks talking about a potential coal book where you see a V-shape recovery in 2017, just given drawdowns, how would you dimension that or what kind of probability would you assigned to case like that? Lance Fritz : Ravi, I think you're right if you look at kind of the burn, the burn has stepped up, but the inventory still are high on a relative basis. They are still 35 days higher than a five year average. So, you have to burn off those inventories even as the burn has stepped up. And so that is a headwind to growing coal volumes in the third quarter. As you look at the outlook for next year as we say always it depends on weather, it depends on natural gas pricing, it depends on energy consumption. So, that's what's going to drive in the future. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. Quick one first on inventories, I don't think you've commented on inventories in the effect on Intermodal, does that situation seem to be getting any better or is that still an issue that makes it hard to see a lot of improvement in Intermodal volumes? Eric Butler : Tom, inventories have gotten better -- have retreated from the seven year highs that we saw last month. They are still high in a relative basis, but they are coming down. Lance Fritz : Tom, to add a little technicolor to that in that domestic Intermodal space something that Eric continually reminds us is that there's a lot of opportunity out there from a truck competitive perspective. And that really informs a pretty good portion of our ability to grow. That overall consumer demand and demand for goods is what is informed that retail to sales inventory ratio and inventory in general. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. Thank you. And then the second question how would you -- I was just wondering if you kind of frame the way we would think about operating leverage as volumes get less worse and then hopefully in 2017 they actually grow. Given current train length and ability to expand that given the initiatives Lance that you mentioned, how would we think about the operating leverage and kind of how long you can go with handling volume without adding a whole lot of incremental cost? Lance Fritz : Cameron? Cameron Scott : With the amount of locomotives we have in storage, the locomotive productivity leverage is fantastic. On the employee side, depending on where growth shows up, we will continue to bring furloughed employees back and potentially transfer employees to the part of the network where growth is residing. So, we continue to see our employee pipeline staying very, very lean and there is great opportunity in every category with train size. Our coal network is truly the only network that is optimized to a very large extent every other network we have has plenty of headroom to train size. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. Can you size that, is that 10% room or 20% or is there a way to kind of frame that train size opportunity? Cameron Scott : I think you see as quarter-to-quarter making continued improvement and we feel very confident you'll continue to see that. Lance Fritz : Hey Tom, this is Lance, again. We've done a nice job staying ahead of demand in terms of overall capacity whether it's fungible capacity or track capacity. Clearly at this point, given how we've built out the network and we're supporting hundred and 180,000 or 190,000 seven-day carloads a couple of years ago, we've ample capacity for growth at this point. Robert Knight : We won't do this, I promise on to many questions, Tom. This is Rob and I have to pile on. All of that leverage that we're confident in that Cam and Lance just talked through are all embedded in that drive to that 60 plus or minus operating ratio and of course, as you know we're striving to even set our sights beyond that at 55. So, it's that confidence that we are well-positioned with positive volume growth to be in a great position of leveraging that. Thomas Wadewitz : Great. Okay. Thanks for all the perspective. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions Kenneth Hoexter : Hey, Great. Good morning. Just want to follow-up on the international side of Intermodal. Eric you talked a bit about carrier consolidation, I wouldn't think that has much to do with the demand side that's been filling their slots or the oversupply in the market. Would -- what you're thoughts on the state of global trade? Seems like we're starting to see some of the port volumes pick up a bit, just wanted to see if that's something you're seeing as well as any or is that a shift from the Panama Canal change or Suez Canal any thoughts on the state of global trade? Eric Butler : Yeah, so I think if you look at the absolute volumes in the TT [ph] trait, they are not strong. There are some period-to-period kind of shifts going on and you do see some of the business that shifted to the canal because of the strike just gradually coming back there. So, that's kind of coloring some of the trend, but the TT trade volumes are relatively weak from a historical standpoint. If you look at the carrier consolidation issues, there's huge volatility going on in there. As I mentioned at the last earnings release significant volatility in terms of mergers, acquisitions and that volatility does have impact to the supply chain depending on which carriers have what book of business that you're aligned with. So, that volatility is impacting what we see in the supply chain. Kenneth Hoexter : Great. Rob any thoughts on the balance sheet, obviously, pretty strong situation here. Thoughts on increasing the buyback accelerating given the volatility in the stock just kind of your thoughts on cash flow? Robert Knight : I mean Ken, as you know, it all starts with driving a stronger cash flow as we can and we're obviously committed on returning cash to shareholders and we'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of at what price and when and how much we actually buyback. So, same philosophy, focus on generating as much cash as we can, so that we're in a high class challenge of deciding what to do with that cash and I would expect it will continue to be opportunistic as we move forward on the share buybacks. Kenneth Hoexter : Great. Thanks for the thoughts. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Eric Morgan : Good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on some of your grain comments. Sounds like the set-up from harvest perspective is pretty constructive, I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color specifically with corn prices coming down so much recently and the dollar still strong. If there is enough storage capacity could we be in a similar environment as last year where farmers just don't want to move the crops? Eric Butler : Eric, I think you have piped all of the dynamics exactly correct quarter prices are coming down. They are projected to come down even more because of the strong harvest that is projected to come, but there is an issue where it will have to move, so that is exactly the dynamic that's going on. There is probably some headwinds to farmers wanting to move it, but there's probably some physical logistics where they have to move it and that's some of I think what we're seeing in the outlook. Eric Morgan : Okay, I appreciate it. And just a quick one is there kind of good way to think about land sales going forward? Lance Fritz : I'm sorry, Brandon, could you repeat that? Eric Morgan : Just on the other income line is there a good run rate to think about with respect to land sales. Lance Fritz : I'm sorry. Eric Butler : Eric, no, I mean other income plus or minus 150 is kind of a number, but no, those tend to be as you've seen lumpy and there's no straight-line way of thinking about that. Eric Morgan : Okay. Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hoffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Hoffman : Thank you. Hey Eric, I just wanted to ask you a question about in the money which I think something came up a few questions ago. If we look at Powder River Basin coal, say relative to Western markets, relative to some of the Midwest markets, just where prices are now, where prices may or may not be and if I look at ethanol with corn prices down and diesel fuel prices up how close are we to be in the money on these products in terms of the forward outlook? Eric Butler : So, I assume you're asking a coal question and ethanol question separately? So, on the coal question I would say it depends on what energy region you're in, what ISO, what RT you're in; it depends on the utility that's within that region. So, it depends on a lot of different things. I think it's instructive to look at the fact of the reference increase in burn month-over-month to indicate that clearly there are a lot more utilities and -- that are in the money just if you look at that increase burn. So, that would be my coal comment. In terms of ethanol, I think ethanol from a use standpoint is \"always in the money\" because it is needed as a necessary oxygen and a replacement for the MBTEs for gasoline and so as gasoline volumes go, ethanol blending with that will go the question is how much margin the ethanol manufacturers are making. But ethanol is more driven by gasoline sales and then need to get the oxygenate and the replacement for the MBTEs. LanceFritz: Hey, Jeff just one piece on that PRB answer and that is while natural gas where it is right now 270-ish plus or minus has put some additional units \"in the money\" I think in the context you're asking are weather in the central part of the country and in the Southeast is helping tremendously with increased electricity demand and that's putting more units online just from a raw demand perspective. Jeffrey Hoffman : That's where I was going with this is to the extent you have incremental burn demand, are you more in the money and more likely to be moving coal. Just one last follow-up Eric on the brown sand comment that you made on the frac sand, are we getting to the point where we're seeing increased demand for the white frac sand or not yet? Eric Butler : Yeah, so if you look at the number of drilling rigs they're up modestly -- I think the number is -- you're going from like 400 rigs to 430 rigs or something like that, that's close to probably what the number is compared to 1,000 rigs last year. So, it's increased modestly because the price of fuel has increased and there is slightly more drilling activity. I think the amount of white sand we'll see will be a direct correlation to as drilling activity comes on you'll see white sand demand go up. Jeffrey Hoffman : All right. Hey congratulations in a tough quarter and thank you. Eric Butler : Thank you. LanceFritz: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. LanceFritz: Good morning. Justin Long : So, I wanted to ask about the volume guidance for a 6% to 8% decline for the full year. So, that's worse than your guidance last quarter for a mid-single-digit decline, but if we look at 2Q volumes, they finished fairly close to your initial expectation for a 10% decline. And it sounds like you're a little more incrementally positive on coal and grain. So, can you just help us understand what drove this guidance reduction in terms of the volumes seems like in the back half of the year? Robert Knight : Yeah, Justin this is Rob, I would say the biggest piece and I totally understand your question because you're exactly right in the terms of the way you map through that is centers around the consumer. I mean it centers around the Intermodal product as much as anything else in the cautiousness that we're expressing today. You're right, we did come in a little bit stronger in the second quarter, largely driven that pick up in coal. If you look at the difference in the second quarter where we finish what we had guided to, but the full year number simply said is largely driven by that consumer cautiousness that we're seeing in the Intermodal space. Justin Long : Okay, great. That's helpful. And secondly I wanted to get your thoughts around how your core price increases in general merchandise are trending relative to your core price increases in Intermodal. I know you don't break that out specifically, but are you seeing general merchandise in Intermodal pricing trending up at similar levels or is the Intermodal increase something like 100 basis points less because of the excess capacity in truckload? Robert Knight : Justin, you nailed it when you said you know we don't give that break out because we endeavor to price to market and drive value in every one of our commodity groups, but we don't break out by commodity as you're striving for. Justin Long : But just from a high level can you say that general merchandise prices decreases are above what you're seeing in Intermodal? Robert Knight : No, and I would say number one, it varies each sort of negotiation is separate, but I wouldn't even go so far as to say that. Justin Long : Okay. Fair enough I appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Cameron maybe a question for you. It looks like the volatility of ocean carrier alliances and some of the changing of vessel causes is bringing down that international Intermodal, and you still have like 5% reduction in train length. How long do you think it will be before you can get that back up or should we be expecting you to kind of have to deal with that lower train length because of the headwind? Cameron Scott : We adjust our Intermodal program on a weekly basis looking at inbound volumes that Eric does his best to forecast. And so balancing customer requirements and productivity is always a tight rope. Our first priority is to take care of our customers. And so we will continue to make those adjustments on week-by-week basis. David Vernon : Would you expect that train length to back up? Cameron Scott : As we step into the second half of the year depending as Rob outlined on what the consumer does driving Intermodal, we absolutely can bring that train size metric right back in line. David Vernon : Okay. And then maybe Rob as a quick follow-up. Could you comment a little bit about the cadence of the operating results through the quarter, it would seem like you have been aggressively kind of pushing down on the headcount and then saw that sequential improvement into the volume growth I guess did results, was there any kind of a certain infection forward in result and the trajectory result as we move through the quarter? Robert Knight : I'm following your question David, I would say no, I mean it was a continuation of our focus on being as efficient and as productive as we can which I think our results reflect lined up well given the unfortunate downturn in 11% volume. So, I would say there's nothing unique about that other than it was a good hard work across the entire organization to make the right decisions. David Vernon : So, the run rate profitability was kind of the same at the beginning of the month as at the end of the month or end of quarter? Robert Knight : Yeah, yet fuel was a big -- I would say there's nothing to call it there other than the fuel which rose late in the quarter. David Vernon : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Solomon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Rob Solomon : Hey, thanks. Cameron, actually just to dig in a little bit more of with regard to the Intermodal train sizes, can you describe kind of what was going on with the domestic Intermodal train size versus the international and kind of the factors that was driving relative weakness that we saw with regard to train lengths? Cameron Scott : On the domestic front, we will pay attention to what is being indicated on a weekly basis. We have extreme sensitivity to UPS and some of our LTL customers that we will always preference for any of those trains as long as the volumes are adequate. And as I said on the international side, we really depend on Eric's forecast on what is hitting our ports and we'll make the appropriate decisions on a week-to-week basis. The good news on the Intermodal front, despite the decline, is that there is plenty of opportunity to increase train size as we see volumes coming back into that space. Eric Butler : Yeah. Rob, this is Eric. I wouldn\u2019t had a lot of focus on kind of the train size in Intermodal. We're always adding different products and services as part of our growth and value proposition as part of our conversion strategy. And so you could be adding a product or service in the line and it will start small because it adds the potential to grow and that's part of the mix in train size that you'll always see. Rob Solomon : Right. That makes sense. I guess Eric to kind of follow-up with regard to just kind of market dynamics, can you give us a sense if we take about automotive kind of on a very holistic basis including kind of inbound parts to the manufacturers of the automotive as well as the automotive part producers how big that represents and then maybe which networks that's running on between unit train and manifest? Eric Butler : Okay. So, trying to make sure I understand your question so auto parts network is a growing network, it grew about 9%, 10% in the quarter. It's smaller than our multilevel network, but it is growing. Probably two-thirds, three quarters of it does run as part of our premium Intermodal network running container shipments and that's a necessity because it is a premium product. Rob Solomon : Yeah. And if I think about just how big it is as a percentage of total volumes just look at the automotive line segments, it's little over 10%. But if I could kind of the metals that are going to the factories as well as parts in Intermodal that would be going to the automotive parts producers, how much additional volume would that represent for your network? Good rule of thumb, not really. Eric Butler : I don't know if there's a good rule of thumb there. Robert Knight : Rob, this is Rob, I would say you're using the auto's examples which is a good one and there are other examples where we enjoy to your point. We enjoy the sort of multiple move and in fact, I would just -- using your example I would say we also supply coal to the utilities providing the electricity to make the car. So, there's a lot of moving parts there, specifically what percent autos, we don't have that. Rob Solomon : Okay. Thanks for the time guys. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks operator. Hey guys, apologize if this was covered, but our phone dropped you for a little bit here. Eric you mentioned that there was a sequential increase in the burn from June to May, I think you said from May to June, I think you said 47%, what's the historical increase in burn? Eric Butler : I don't have the historical number right at my fingertips. That is larger than it typically historical norm. As you know you do have the shelf month there and the second quarter because you are not heating or cooling and then you have the pickup cyclically, but that is higher than what you typically see. Jason Seidl : Okay. That's good color. Also, I'm looking at your stock obviously under a little bit of pressure today, I think based on some of the incoming calls, I received there is a little bit of worry of your core pricing falling down a little bit. If you had the bucket the pressure on core pricing between loose truck capacity and increased competition from other rail carriers, how would you do it on a percentage basis? Eric Butler : As a said before you know they are all low competitive factors that are going on. I mentioned earlier there might've been while you dropped off the call that there was surplus capacity in all loads truck capacity, shipping capacity, rail capacity, and you do see that capacity tightening across all modes as you look into the future. Jason Seidl : But there wasn't one that was more prominent than the other as you look at 2Q? Eric Butler : All of those factors are factors that go into our pricing and we price to our value and those are all factor. Jason Seidl : Okay. Guys, thanks for the time as always I appreciate it. Eric Butler : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. John Barnes : Hey good morning. I wanted to go back to your comment around maybe some of the logistics on the grain business. So, we had a couple of decent harvest over the last couple years and for whatever reason we keep hearing about storage is tight and yet the crop never seems to get moved. Have we finally get that inflection point where you know the storage is tight enough there is too much you know the prior harvest still in storage, this one just absolutely you it has to get moved this year. Eric Butler : I don't know if I'm an expert on kind of the inflection point of total storage, I do think if you look at the trends and you're seeing some of the trends materialize even now storage is tight, farm income is under stress given the lower pricing. And so there is a cash flow dynamic for farmers in terms of holding versus selling that comes into play here. There is a demand that is picking up because of the weakness in some international markets like South American markets and then there is a big crop coming in. So, if you look at all of those things they do indicate that there is a high probability you are going to see strong moves. John Barnes : Okay. And then you mentioned the difficulties in South America, strong U.S. dollar continues to plague the export activity. Is the domestic demand this year in domestic moves of grain going to be more important than they have been in years past? We see there may be less of this moving for export purposes? Eric Butler : We do have a strong domestic franchise. As you know exports are picking up and they are all interrelated because to the extent you have strong export markets that takes the demand and we also participate in the export markets whether it's moving into the Gulf, moving into the River, moving into the West Coast particularly the P&W. So we have a strong domestic franchise, but the export markets also benefited us. Lance Fritz : And Eric, recall John that Mexico is also an export market for us. John Barnes : Okay, but you are saying that the export you actually are seeing some movement in the export side of the business. Eric Butler : Export markets are picking up. John Barnes : Okay. Very good. Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ben Hartford : Good morning guys. Curious how you feel about service today relative to let's say the high water marks pre-2014 some of the metrics trends being one of them are back to those measures. Obviously, there is some mix and other elements of play but how do you feel about the \"service across the network today\" relative to prior to the issues that you in the industry experienced in early 2014? Lance Fritz : Ben, this is Lance, when you think about our overall network in the service we are providing, absent the impacts of things like the flooding that we've experienced in Texas there's some just epic weather events, we're performing essentially at a 2013 or 2012 type level. So, our service performance level on average in aggregate is about as good as it's been for this kind of volume level. Our intent and what Cameron and team are constantly working on is ways to improve that, right. So 2012 and 2013 are a benchmark, they are not the only benchmark. We think we can do better than that over time and his team is constantly working with the commercial team and other functions of the railroad to try to find ways to improve that service product. Ben Hartford : That's helpful. Are there any specific elements or areas of service where you don't believe that you are back to those 2012, 2013 benchmarks for still have some room to go? Lance Fritz : Yeah, I would tell you we have room for improvement virtually everywhere and that's not a statement of not as good as 2012 or 2013 that's the statement of -- we are never perfect. There is always an opportunity to run the network more on time from original terminal to making sure we don't leave any cars behind to running the premium domestic Intermodal product at greater speeds or at more significant -- significantly reduced span. All of those things are within our visuals and we're working on all of them. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mark Levin with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Levin : Hey guys, thanks for the time. Most of my questions have been asking and answered. I just wanted to see if there was any potential impact from the Mexican Excise Tax Credit benefit the one that KSU alluded to yesterday? Robert night : No. Mark Levin : No benefit whatsoever. Robert night : Right. Mark Levin : Okay, great. And then with regard to auto yield and the mix headwind that you mentioned this quarter, when you look forward is that something as we model RPU in the auto segment we should be mindful of what type of expectations should we have as that looking forward there? Eric Butler : Our auto part businesses growing faster than our finished vehicle's business because that is the growth area as you saw that in the second quarter auto-parts business as a lower RPUs than the finished vehicle's business. Mark Levin : And will the decrease moderate or is that sort of a way to think about that going forward this quarter? Eric Butler : There aren't decreases, the auto-parts business is growing. Mark Levin : Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Lance Fritz : All right Mark. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Donald Broughton : Good morning gentlemen. Lance Fritz : Good morning Don. Donald Broughton : Help me understand better core pricing, obviously it's a very challenging environment as you reported your core pricing essentially cut in half over the last four or five quarters. Does your reported 2% core pricing represent the pricing achieved on all new contracts settled in that quarter -- for instance the 2% being just those settled in the second quarter or does that represent the amount of year-over-year gains made in your overall book of business? Robert Knight : Yeah, Don, this is Rob. The way we calculate that core price number is what do we actually yield in the quarter from our pricing actions and as you think note when we calculations that I'm proud to say is ultraconservative and that is we take it across our entire book of revenue even as a work contracts that are being repriced in that particular timeframe it is what do we yield overall. And would also just want to of course as you know given that calculation when we don't have the benefit of positive growth in commodities like coal, we obviously no longer have any of the legacy renewals, I mean that's part of the change if you look at where we are today versus where we were a year plus ago. Donald Broughton : What a second Rob, I'm a little confused. So, it's the contracts reset in the quarter and their effect in the overall book is that what you mean? Robert Knight : No, it's not necessarily what was reset in the quarter but what dollars. The calculus is simply what dollars to be a from price increases during the quarter. So, if perhaps was something that was reset prior to the quarter, but that's -- and again what did we yield against our entire book of revenue. Donald Broughton : So, the denominator in the equation is the overall book of business? Robert Knight : That's right Donald Broughton : So, that means the core pricing to deteriorate from 4% to 3.5% to 3% to 2.5% to 2%, it means the pricing you are cheating on all new contracts is actually less than 2%. Eric Butler : Don, there's a number of moving parts and Rob just walked you through them. One thing that's happening is we might've achieved incremental price on a piece of business that isn\u2019t moving or isn\u2019t moving at the same volume. So, we don't get the benefit of that price. It doesn't affect the topline. It could be that ALF is changing period-to-period there is a number of moving parts there you can't just presume the calculus is lower yields period-to-period. Donald Broughton : Right. But if the -- for the overall -- if the denominator is the overall book of business in the rate increase has to be less than what the core is that you are stating no matter how perverse the mix gets? Robert Knight : We're agreeing that the yield from the pricing this quarter for lots of different reasons was lower Donald Broughton : Okay. So, then let me ask another question is there a floor -- is there a rate of core pricing at which you're going to simply draw the line and say no, we will not accept less pricing than that, we'll lose the volume if we have to, but we're not going to accept a lower level of pricing than say 1% or 1.5% or 2%. Eric Butler : Don, we've stated even earlier in this call there is a floor and a floor is it re-investable and does it reflect the value that we are delivering to that particular customer market. So, we don't think of floors in terms of percent yield or percent price, with think of floors in terms of if that piece of business or book of business does not re-investable, it becomes much less attractive to us and we have demonstrated over a long period of time that we will choose not to pursue business that does not generate an attractive financial return over a long period of time. Donald Broughton : That's absolute to. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Our next question is from the lien of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions. Keith Schoonmaker : Thank you. I'd like to ask a bit more about the automotive franchise, but with a long-term focus. First, what portion of the automotive portfolio consist of moves to or from Mexico? And could you describe the positive and negative impact to your franchise from production shift in New Mexico compared to prior production locations? Eric Butler : Yeah. So, about half of our franchises to or from Mexico that's all unfinished vehicles and parts. We -- the Mexico volume is growing as you know. Historically, it was like 2 million vehicles, I think they are probably up to about 3.7 million vehicles produced in Mexico. The forecasts is they are going to get close to about 5 million vehicles produced in Mexico. We think we have a great Mexico franchise. We're the only railroad that has real connectivity to all six rail border crossings. We have great interline business relationships with every railroad in Mexico. We also have multimodal relationships that we are working with and Mexico. So, we think we have eight great franchise and will partake in that uptake over time. Keith Schoonmaker : And so the shift in general [Indiscernible] production in Mexico as opposed to in U.S. or Canada is a positive from revenue gains or is it negative due to other factors like length of hall? Eric Butler : So, there's a lot of factors that go I would say generally we think the net shift is a positive for our franchise. Keith Schoonmaker : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions/ Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Any industrial production in the industrial product segment, you called out the severe weather in Texas in the quarter but otherwise, very strong construction activity. Could you just speak to kind of the 2Q to 3Q dynamic there and the trend in the back half assuming that we don't have bad weather events coming forward. Thanks. Eric Butler : We see a normal cyclical pick up as you go through the 2Q to the 3Q just because the summer construction season that we see across most of our serving territory. Don't have as much construction in the winter as you do in the summer as we do expect to see sequential pick up. You also are seeing some strengthening in housing starts not as much as you would expect waste on the demographic trends. We think that's a positive for the long-term for our business because the demographic trends are suggesting there has to be a stronger pick up than what we've seen. So you are still seeing that along with the cyclical trends so we think sequentially that will be positive for us. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. And then just on this the new potential minimum crew size rule as being considered, could you just discussed the company perspective and perceived timing on if shop should happen if you would approach that? Lance Fritz : Thank you, Scott. Regarding the FRA's proposed rule on minimum crew size, historically that has been a topic for collective bargaining over the past number of decades and we believe that's where it belongs. There is no evidence that criticize is related to safety. The FRA stated that in the preamble to their own rule. The NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board has also stated that they see no empirical evidence between crew size and safety. Having said that, we do not have any plan right now to reduce crew size in our locomotives. What we think should happen is we should allow technology to take its course and determine when it's appropriate for some of the work to be removed from the cab and to be placed somewhere else. There is an amount of work that gets done for every train and that work needs to be done. It's just a matter of where it will be done. So, that's our perspective on that. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing remarks. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in October. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow today\u2019s formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin. Lance Fritz : Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products both down double-digits. Agricultural product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015 as grain shipments finally started to show some strength. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which was up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year. Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives, as well as positive core pricing helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our six value tracks. This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience, while efficiently and safely managing our resources. Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric. Eric Butler : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6% with near record agricultural product shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets and a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy related and international intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid re-investable returns even in these difficult markets and we remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume in the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our six business groups. Ag products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and let the grain volumes 27% in the quarter. Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter as adverse weather in South America caused significant loses elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grained products carload advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments. Food in refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter driven by 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle's shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact that volume through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of $17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter.  On the product side, a continued focused on over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume. Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48%, due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments were up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter. Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year.  Powder River Basin and Colorado Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16% respectively in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer than average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the five-year average. Industrial products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter.  Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction products volume was down 8%, due to weather impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, and an increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year.  Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown service domestic was nearly flat.  International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continues to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory on the Hanjin bankruptcy. To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag products we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports.  Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at $17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of $17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. Our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. In industrial products lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes.  We anticipate a softer year end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand.  Finally in intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron Scott : Thanks Eric and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.77. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact.  Although we continue to make significant improvement, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who did not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships.  Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges.  As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a food network were somewhat offset by productivity gains such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives.  Moving on to resources, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with a goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year.  Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads. As you know, we\u2019ve been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year.  We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We are adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries.  Turning to network productivity, while we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks ran at all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter of record. Re-crew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew had insufficient time to complete the trip is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter re-crew rate was 2.3%, a near 2 point improvement from 2015 and a third quarter record.  As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident free environment. And where growth opportunities arise we\u2019ll leverage that growth to the bottom-line to increase utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. With that I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks, good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions, and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. Operating income totaled almost $2 billion and a 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015.  Interest expense of $184 million was up 17%, compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.  Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share.  Turning now to our topline, fright revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate a net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year.  The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect a competitive marketplace and as soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return driven quarter pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers.  Moving onto the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. General, wage, and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full-year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year.  As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult.  Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 6% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record 1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon.  Moving on to our other expense categories, purchase, services, and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base.  For the full-year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes which reduced car hire expense and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline.  Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter, as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year. As we discussed back in September, we have written-off the $13 million of accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy.  In addition, we also were encouraged $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects, which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned.  Turning to our operating ratio, the third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter.  Looking at cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending.  For the full-year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September.  Taking a look now at the balance sheet, our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of over 1.9 times up from 1.7 at year end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than two times. For the first nine months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares totaling about $2.2 billion.  Since initiating sales repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year. So that\u2019s a recap of the third quarter results. Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits and we still expect total full-year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range.  While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 and Zero initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible. And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about a hundred million dollar to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries.  While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. From a productivity perspective, our G55 and Zero initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year and we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvements well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60% plus or minus on a full-year basis by 2019, and longer term we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 and Zero initiatives.  So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As the team has articulated here this morning we continue to experience a difficult, but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below a year ago. The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges and unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods. However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. A recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million btu, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses.  We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With the record harvest currently underway we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our Ag customers.  Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we will continue to do what Union Pacific does best, operate a safe, efficient, and productive network while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great, good morning. Just can you, Rob talk a little bit about the projects you are writing-off, I just want to understand what kind of cost we have going forward and it looks like as the business comes back, you're starting to ramp up your locomotives and employees, but you notice that there are fewer people in the training pipeline, should we see some start-up costs as you start to bring people back in? Thanks. Rob Knight : Yeah, Ken what I commented in the quarter was around 17 million of projects that were started that we have chosen to not pursue and so we\u2019re taking adjustments there. So, I think if you look longer term that\u2019s a number that is not going to repeat, I mean we occasionally will have situations like that, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that that\u2019s a number similar to the Hanjin receivable write-off that I mentioned that are not going to repeat in that line item. In terms of the cost, we are confident that we are well situated both on locomotives and employees to leverage the volume that we hope does materialize. So we've got fewer people in training line because we've got so many people if you will in furlough status at this point. So, we feel very good about our ability to and we'd love nothing more than to see volume pickup and be able to put resources back to work. Ken Hoexter : Great thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. With the international shipping lines under continues financial pressures you noted and the prospect of a record grain crop match back is something that I\u2019ve been hearing more about, just curious is that something that you\u2019re facilitating and potentially see as a means to increase market share in intermodal grain or both? Lance Fritz : Eric? Eric Butler : As you mentioned Cherilyn there is a significant volatility going on in the international container ship business. There have been three major mergers, one bankruptcy, there are a number of other entities that are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain and in particular the DDGs to China. We are continuing to that look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia.  We\u2019re also really excited longer term or mid-term in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf and we think that that\u2019s going to be an excellent opportunity for match backs also. So, we think both of those things are great opportunities. Of course, China occasionally as they have right now have tariffs or other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DDGs, but we think long-term that should be opportunity for us. Lance Fritz : Cherilyn this is Lance. What Eric just outlined is indicative of the franchise strength that the Union Pacific brings to the industry. We've got breadth and coverage in a number of markets that allow us visibility into potential match backs. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great and just by ways of very quick follow-up, when you say medium-to-long term on the plastics match backs is that sort of 2018 and beyond? Eric Butler : Yes, I mean as we've been saying for the last several quarters, we think most of the growth will happen in 2018 and beyond. There might be a tale of a small ramp-up towards the end of 2017, but basically 2018 and beyond. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That's all from me. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Hi, thanks good morning everyone. A couple of questions on pricing, you've committed to a positive core pricing, can you also commit to pricing over inflation? And second, can you just help us understand what the driver of the pricing, I would say the deterioration in the gains have been, is it mostly into real competition, is it truck competition, or is it you guys kind of just supporting some of your customers who may be going through a hard time and hoping to get it back little later on? Lance Fritz : Eric? Eric Butler : Hi Ravi. So, one of the things that we're real excited about is the great franchise we have and we have a very diverse franchise. And some components of our franchise obviously as we mentioned, the energy related and the International related are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive conditions. So, we've been talking about the challenges in coal, coal as you know has been greatly challenged not only a demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great strong competitor to coal.  The below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We\u2019re excited or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal, but that has clearly had an impact likewise. The three mergers, the one large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal.  Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at re-investable returns and we think that looking at the broadness of our portfolio we are pretty positive in the future about our ability to price for the excellent value we provide and we're going to price above re-investable returns and we have a broad portfolio of opportunities to drive that message. Ravi Shanker : Thanks so much for that color. Can you also, do you have the confidence that you can stay above inflation in pricing? Rob Knight : Ravi this is Rob, let me answer that. I mean clearly long-term that is still our goal. The one thing with these challenges and opportunities that Eric just outlined, you know one things that we haven't finalized yet, but as we look into 2017, at this stage it looks like global insights inflationary numbers are like 2.5% and our number may well be above that from an inflationary standpoint, largely driven by the health and welfare costs on our labor lines. So, still some work to play out there, but longer term absolutely we are as committed as ever to driving that price. Ravi Shanker : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the pricing side, you commented how the higher natural gas price is helpful for coal, so that\u2019s obviously a constructive thing, but I'm wondering if you are optimistic if that will - that should help the cold tonnage and obviously if you have a normal winter and so forth, but what about the pricing in coal, if we stay at this gas price will go a little higher, do you think that the, you know you will be able to go transition to better competitive environment where you could raise price for coal transport or is that something that some of that pricing pressure would likely present? Rob Knight : Yeah, so Tom you are asking a couple of different things here, as you know there are always a variety of market conditions that impact price transportation capacity availability and availability on transportation networks for other commodities, as you know competition, weather there are a lot of things, natural gas prices that will effect coal. We are positive that the use of coal should be increasing in the mid-term, if you just look at, again the competition against natural gas, if you look at the economic pick up and the use of energy we are confident that the use of coal should be picking up in the near mid-term and we saw that in the second to third quarter in terms of the sequential use of coal. We will continue to price for re-investible returns based on the value of service that we provide and we are confident in that strategy, we are confident in the value that we are providing and we are going forward. Lance Fritz : Hi Tom, this is Lance. Clearly an environment where natural gas price is increasing, put it north of $3.50 or so and where weather is favorable and where the stock piles have been worked down that is a better pricing and competitive environment that not. So it helps. Tom Wadewitz : Okay I appreciate that and for the follow-up, I don't know if this is kind of Rob or Cameron, but you\u2019ve shown nice improvement in the train length good momentum there, so that\u2019s very favorable, I\u2019m wondering if you look at 2017 and if you do see a volume growth, is there a couple of things play out, let's say you see a couple of points in volume growth, how does that translate to incremental margins? Could you see something that well above the normal 50% incremental margin we\u2019re talking about, could you see something 60% 70% as you expand train length more and see some of the benefit of the cost take-out and so forth, is that a reasonable equation or would you be more cautious about the incremental in 2017 if the volumes come back? Thank you. Cameron Scott : Rob, why don\u2019t you take that. Rob Knight : Yes Tom. This won't surprise you, but we won't give guidance on the actual incremental margins, but everything you said are certainly opportunities. I mean as you know our G55 and Zero initiatives which are some 15 different areas and our view is we\u2019re looking at every single cost bucket in the entire company and attacking it aggressively with an eye on safety and efficiency and customer values. So, I would just answer that question by saying the scenario you outlined where there is positive volume and a reasonably positive economic environment would give us an outstanding opportunity to continue to drive productivity and staying away from an actual incremental margin calculation we would expect it to be a positive contributor. And by the way for us to go from where we are today to our 60 plus or minus by 2019 and with an eye on getting to 55 or so we're going to have a very healthy incremental margins from here to there. So we're going to certain certainly go after it. Cameron Scott : Tom as we've opened up the door now to the productivity in your question, I just want to give recognition to the entire UP team who have done a tremendous job in a reduced volume environment of finding ways to grow, for instance manifest train size 5% year-over-year that\u2019s a phenomenal effort, and that\u2019s just one of many in terms of finding productivity on the network. I think the team has done a tremendous job in creating productivity in a pretty difficult environment. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, clearly you guys are doing a great job in that area. That's an impressive performance. Thank you for the time. Rob Knight : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Seidl : Thank you operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I\u2019m going to stick on the price force here for now. As we look at that 1.5% you mentioned, tough volume environment, competitive environment, is this something that you would expect UNP to hover around for a while or what could break it out of that 1.5%? I\u2019m trying to figure out, is this near term are we going to see that throughout 2017 unless things recover from here? Lance Fritz : You know Jason we don't give any guidance on price. Clearly, as we've outlined a little bit here this morning, there are certain markers that make the competitive environment better for pricing. Any time, for instance capacity and alternative modes tightens up that's good. Demand for the core underlying commodities as it increases that\u2019s good. So you just got to keep your eye on what's happening with for instance natural gas prices and stockpiles and weather in the cold world. What's happening on import demand and the financial help of our international intermodal ocean carriers that helps? What happens for industrial production in the United States that helps? What's happening to truck capacity, alternative modes that helps? So all of those are helpful environment for our pricing. Jason Seidl : I appreciate that. I mean I just, even checking my records, I can't remember the last time you guys were below we would call your real cost inflation. Looking at 2017, how does - and I know you guys don't provide guidance specifically, but are you pretty confident that you are going to be able to grow your volumes and 2017 forget what percentage, but just grow the volumes? Lance Fritz : Eric do you want to handle that? Eric Butler : As you say we don't give volume guidance, but if you look at the markets that we have out there and you look at the pickup and different markets that we have. We feel pretty positive that as the economy continues to grow and is slowly strengthening. In many of our markets we feel very positive about the run rate opportunity. The one cautionary area that we have talked about before is in automotive sales, we continue to think those are cautionary, but if you look at even our Mexico franchise we had great growth in our Mexico franchise in the quarter. We still think that there are good opportunities to grow volume. Cameron Scott : If I could just add to Eric's comments Jason, just kind of remind you and everyone else, you know our thesis from this point over the longer period is a positive volume environment and you look out the - as Eric just pointed out, you look at the unique diverse opportunities of our franchise while we are giving precise volume guidance for next year, but we do feel there is great opportunity for us to continue to leverage and over the longer period of time for us to have volume on the positive side of the ledger certainly. Jason Seidl : Well, let me ask you quickly in another way, so if you saw negative volume next year that would mean that something would have to decelerate from here with the trends, is that an accurate statement? Cameron Scott : Yes that's an accurate statement. Generally speaking, we got to be playing in multiple markets, but that\u2019s a fairly accurate statement. Jason Seidl : Okay. Gentlemen I appreciate the time as always. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for getting me on the call here. A couple, I think a few months into this year we have been talking about OR improvement even when volumes are down pretty significantly in the first quarter, and I know you guys backed off a bit in 2Q, but I guess as I listen to the call here, it sounds like pricing might be in-line with cost inflation maybe even a little bit below next year and let\u2019s say volumes don't come back tremendously, what can you guys do on the operating ratio that maybe we could instill some confidence again that you guys would break into [indiscernible] territory? Lance Fritz : Let me start Brandon, this is Lance and I\u2019ll remind you that we have confidence, extreme confidence in our ability to continually find opportunities to be more efficient, reduce waste, and increase the value that we are adding. I\u2019ll ask Cameron just to give us a handful of examples of things we're working on when we are going into next year, but our bucket is full of opportunity to be better. Cameron Scott : On train size, the only commodity group that is truly optimized or nearly optimized is coal. Every single commodity that we have out there from manifest to automotive to intermodal to grain or rock all has tremendous opportunities for us to continue with the results that you have seen, so we feel confident that that is going to happen in 2017. The record all-time re-crew rate from a process perspective we feel like we have well in hand and we should continue to see that into 2017 and 2018. And we work on other initiatives like rationalizing our little horsepower for you. We've done a great job of moving to single unit local operations versus two units. There\u2019s a number of initiatives that we have. We\u2019re truly, we're just getting started in framing up the opportunity and getting ready to realize it as we step into the New Year. Lance Fritz : Exactly. And even little things like see [ph] rates that improved 2% year-over-year here, there is plenty of opportunities we look forward to become world-class if you will and in consumption rate for diesel, so there is just a host of issues there Brandon that we can continue to work on. Brandon Oglenski : No, and I appreciate all that you guys probably have gone on that we can see from here, but I guess in retrospect Lance was it just that volume got a lot worse than we thought in the second quarter or was it competitive factors, was it market pricing, what was it that led to the lack of ability to drive OR improvement this year. Lance Fritz : Let me let Rob handle. Rob Knight : Yes Brandon. I mean your comment is right that we have always said and we do believe that we can make improvements in the operating ratio in spite of the lack of volume growth. And in fact if you look at over the last decade, you know we have taken almost 25 points of our operating ratio without the benefit of positive volume over that time frame. I would say that you are exactly right though, here in the short term this year I would say that the major driver of not likely improving the operating ratio this year is the pace of which we've been chasing volume down. I mean it\u2019s, we never have perfect visibility as to where that volume is going to trough and that makes it difficult so we are always kind of chasing if you will and I think that\u2019s really the answer to what you've seen this year. So as we look forward I think it\u2019s still a fair assumption and it is certainly our drive that we expect to make improvements in our operating ratio in spite of what the economy deals us in terms of what happens with volume now. Having said that as we look out over the next several years we do have volume in our thesis on the positive side of the ledger, but we\u2019re going to not use that as an excuse not to make continued productivity improvements. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Group : Hi guys good morning. So, wanted to follow up on pricing, Rob your point about inflation picking up to 2.5% next year is that to caution us that pricing could be below inflation or is that you telling us that we have line of sight to inflation getting higher, so we have line of sight to our pricing accelerating to next year, I\u2019m not sure what you are trying to tell us. Rob Knight : Yes Scott, my point on the inflationary comment is, we do expect inflation to go back up if you will to more normal levels versus the below inflation, below normal levels that we enjoyed this year and again 2.5 global insight are numbers because of health and welfare costs might be higher than that, so my point on that is simply to say not unusual against historical numbers, but we do expect inflationary pressures to be back to sort of normal conditions if you will. Scott Group : But because you have line of sight to inflation picking up do you have line of sight to your pricing re-accelerating too? Rob Knight : I would say no. I mean it\u2019s not mechanical as you know the way we price and we play in so many different markets that they are not - it's not a cookie-cutter, it is not a one size fits all, and as Eric outlined. There are opportunities for us to achieve stronger prize than other areas in the short-term, but we will continue to drive service, drive value and price at minimum of re-investable levels as Eric outlined in spite of what that inflationary number turns out to be. So, I would say they are disconnected if you will in terms of the day-to-day pricing initiatives that we take. Scott Group : So maybe just bigger picture, it feels like for the long term you guys have said hey, we're going to get pricing no matter what if you get volume okay, if we don't get volume we don't care and truthfully you haven't had much volume, but you\u2019ve gotten great pricing, is the philosophy changing where you care more about volume now as part of G55 and so there is, it\u2019s less clear you necessarily always get the pricing? Lance Fritz : Scott our philosophy is not changing and as a matter of fact, our top line this quarter reflects that it\u2019s not changing. We are pursuing business in the marketplace that we can price for the value that we represent and that\u2019s re-investable. And if we can't find that we walk away from it. So nothing has changed about that philosophy. Scott Group : Okay and if I can just ask one more just on grain pricing specifically, so as the grain volumes are finally picking up are there opportunities to start raising grain tariff, I was little surprised by the sequential drop in ag revenue per car this quarter, I don't know if that\u2019s mix or lack of pricing there, does anything specifically on grain pricing? Rob Knight : Yes Scott, I think if you sum up pricing as you know is in public tariff, which is publicly available and I think you would see some of that sequential increase in pricing in the public available tariffs that mirror kind of the demand that\u2019s picking up in grain. I think you will also see in some of the secondary markets huge increases in kind of the value in the secondary markets for equipment for grain, so some of that is yet public visibility too and I think if you look at those public things you would see pricing going with the demand increases. Scott Group : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Danny Schuster : Hi good morning this Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thanks for taking my question here. So just coming back to pricing a little bit, I think investors are looking at the downward trend and wondering whether we could eventually see flat pricing at some point, and I think after today we are a little bit potentially closer to that so what can you tell investors to alleviate the concern that flat pricing is not a possibility? Lance Fritz : Just exactly what we\u2019ve said this morning, which is our pricing philosophy is that we\u2019re looking for markets and opportunities where we can price for the value that we represent and if we can't find that and have it re-investable we\u2019ll keep searching. As markets improve, as the competitive environment improves that should translate into an environment where we have more opportunities than not, but our philosophy, our way of conducting business is not going to change. Danny Schuster : Okay great thank you. And just switching gears on the field side, the discount to spot diesel prices seems to have climbed a little bit this quarter back up to around 66%, another 300 basis points up, so should we expect this trend to continue upwards or in other words expect the discount that you received to spot diesel to diminish as field prices go up? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Rob? Rob Knight : Yes, I guess I would answer that by saying it\u2019s hard to say, I mean I can't give guidance as to what that gap may be, but certainly the way I look at is overall as diesel fuel prices increase we will work hard and have good mechanisms in place to continue to - there may be a timing difference, but our surcharge is in place. So from a net impact we work hard to minimize that, but I can't predict exactly what the delta to the spot will be. Danny Schuster : Okay great, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR, I know you said you are not expecting improvement this year, but do you think we will see year-over-year improvement in the OR in the fourth quarter given what you are expecting for volumes? Lance Fritz : Rob, do you want to \u2026? Rob Knight : Yes, Justin you know as you probably are on top of your - comps get a little bit easier if you will in the fourth quarter number one and number two we can continue to drive the productivity initiatives that we've been successful with this year and volumes get easier and if volumes stay kind of flattish as I outlined in my comments, say even flattish with where they are now, we would see the fourth quarter gap over previous year narrowing. So, having said all that, again without giving specific precise guidance on the OR for the quarter we certainly have an opportunity to do that. Justin Long : Okay, that's really helpful and I don't want to beat the dead horse on core price, but we did see the moderation there and it sounded like in your prepared comments you said it was mainly due to energy and international intermodal, I was wondering if there was any way to frame up how much of a headwind you saw from those two areas of the business like maybe to say that was all 50 basis points of the sequential deceleration that we saw or something like that? Rob Knight : Justin this is Rob, we don't break it out that way, but I would just tell you, I mean again as you've heard me say many times, we don't have just a simple cookie-cutter one price fits all, so all of our markets that we enjoy and again we have more markets because of the diversity of our franchise then many, it gives us opportunities and it\u2019s - the pricing opportunities for us are very diverse, but having said that we don't break out the way you are asking it. Justin Long : Okay fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks, good morning. I do just need to come back to price and I apologies I know it\u2019s been sort of - talked about this morning, but just one thought on renewals, you guys report core pricing be little bit different than some of your peers and I guess I just wanted to get a rough sense of the relationship between inflation and the renewal dynamic and I know it\u2019s not mechanical Rob and you kind of highlighted that, but just generally speaking, higher inflationary environment would you expect that renewals would accelerate as well and how much may be of a lag do you think that there is, I guess I'm just trying to get a rough sense. Regardless of the magnitude, just sort of directionally, I\u2019m guessing they work together, just want to get some color on that would be great? Rob Knight : Yes Chris, I mean just a couple of comments I would make. Number one as I think you and others know we have about 25% of our business if you will that is affected by a list. So over a longer period of time that mechanism sort of may be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but over a longer period of time it tends to reflect what\u2019s happening with rail inflation number one, but I guess I would more broadly say and remind folks the way we calculate price and as you all have heard me say for many years, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we are very conservative in terms of how we calculate price, it is not a same store sales kind of number, it is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular quarter from our pricing actions and the denominator is our an entire book of business. So, it includes contracts that perhaps we didn\u2019t touch certainly in the quarter for pricing. So, having said that there tends to be a little bit of a lead lag if you will in terms of the yield dollars that come from our pricing actions, but again our focus is unchanged from what it\u2019s been at this point in time, you\u2019ve got a couple of markets out there that are particularly challenging, but our commitment to driving value, driving quality service and driving positive price and positive volumes - positive margins has not changed. Chris Wetherbee : Okay that's helpful, I appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears want to follow-up on the coal side, Eric you had mentioned I think 27 days - inventory is your 27 days above average I believe is what you highlighted there, what you think the right number is in terms of sort of the go forward period, what are the natural gas curve is sort of weather has been over the factor over the summer, we don't know what it'll be like over the winter, but what do you think that right number is, how close are you guys to kind of getting towards normalized inventories do you think? Eric Butler : If you think about Powder River Basin inventories, the five-year average as I said was the low 60, 63, 65, and right now we are still at 90. So that\u2019s how you get to the 27 days. I do think that 60-ish number is probably right. If we have normal weather patterns and normal cold winter, if you look at the natural gas futures curve, I think right now it\u2019s like projecting 340 in the early part of next year. That will drive the inventories down. That will drive usage of coal, coal market share in the quarter was 32%, compared to like 28% I think in the second quarter, so coal market share is grown I think, it will be in the good - placed a good position, you will see coal volumes grow, you will see the opportunity for coal pricing to grow you will see inventories go down and I think we will be in a better place. Lance Fritz : One thing to note, you can get to that days inventory reduction adjustment a number of ways. If you think about what's happening in the coal world in a different perspective, on a stock level of qualitative million tons of SPRB coal we are about 3 million tons higher year-over-year and that represents as Eric says about 25 days of burn. So, it really doesn't take much in both how much you have in stock and how much you\u2019re burning to affect that day\u2019s ratio. You can get there in a number of ways. Chris Wetherbee : That's really helpful and real quick, can you say what the coal outlook was for volume within the low-single digit decline in the fourth quarter? Eric Butler : We didn't Chris, but it\u2019s in the, call it in the low teens, it\u2019s probably a reasonable assumption, down low teens. Chris Wetherbee : Okay great. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Lance just wanted to get your views on regulatory backdrop, obviously there\u2019s been a lot of things coming over the is STB and their review of the standalone cost that\u2019s an external consultant come out recently, we\u2019ve got some news as the GAO about ECP bricks [ph], but just looking into next year it seems like it will still be fairly busy on the dock, I just wanted to get your thoughts on, if there will be any potential impact changes in regulations in 2017 that you would be particularly focused on? Lance Fritz : Brian thanks for that question. We are focused on the activity at the STB. That\u2019s largely driven by the reauthorization from Congress about a year ago in that reauthorization Congress has essentially encouraged the STB to work through their doc if they had a backlog of a fair number of action items. Our concern is that that\u2019s interpreted as a desire to regulate the industry further. We don't believe that is the desire of Congress, we think Congress' desire was to have the S&P work through the workload. So we've got our eyeballs and are working on different activities, things like the reciprocal switching roles or the reduction of exemptions of different commodity groups.  We are touching all the right points and making sure our perspective is known and incorporated into the thought process. There is a lot of moving parts there, so it\u2019s taking a fair amount of work on my part on our legal team and our Washington team. I would say our largest concern would be the overwriting overall impact of each individual regulation. If the STB takes those in isolation, we could end up in an impact that is unintended and unconsidered and so we\u2019re also working hard to make sure that the STB takes into account the full perspective of everything they are working and the knock-on impacts of each as a group. Does that make sense? Brian Ossenbeck : Yes it does. And helpful I think you feel the activity you think potentially activist, but it just seemed like a dock that just needed to move forward a bit. Just one real quick question for Eric on the Hanjin impact, you had mentioned the $13 million write-off, I was just curious if there is any operational issues you have been seeing as there's containers come on onshore and people don't necessarily want to move them, anything from the chassis shortage that we have been hearing a little bit about, if that's a concern, clearly it\u2019s a lot of other puts and takes in the international intermodal side right now? Thank you. Eric Butler : Yes Brian, so you knew specific I think has weathered a lot of what I call the operational fallout from the Hanjin bankruptcy fairly well. At a high level on the day they went bankrupt there roughly had about 100 ships on the inflows around the world, 40 owned, about 60 leased and they had lots of issues in terms of what to do with all of the end traffic flows, it was roughly $14 billion worth of goods and in traffic flows lots of issues about what to do with that.  We had a fairly nominal number of boxes in route on our railroad and we've been able to process all of those through - we probably have a couple of dozen left to process through from roughly probably a little over thousand on a day of bankruptcy. So, we navigated that fairly well, there are issues out there in navigating the rest of that and it is an issue for the industry and supply chain in terms of what to do with those boxes both loaded and empty in boxes on chassis what to do with those and that\u2019s something that the industry is going to be struggling with to resolve, but for the Union Pacific side we\u2019ve navigated that fairly well. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks for the detail Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions. John Larkin : Yes thank you very much for taking my question gentlemen. I had a question on coal, Q2 you have said a couple of times that the stockpiles are still well above kind of targeted levels yet sequentially there was a huge step up in coal volume too in theory replenish stockpiles rundown during the harder than normal summer, was that very specific to a few different utilities or what really drove that? It seems a little contradictory to make that comment that coal would be up sequentially even though stockpiles are still on average way above normal? Lance Fritz : Eric can you handle that? Eric Butler : Yeah, the stockpiles have come down, you know if you look at over the second to the third quarter the stockpiles have come down 13 days and it came down to cause the burn increase and so our volumes improved roughly 40% and the stockpiles came down because the burn increased even at a higher percent than that. John Larkin : Okay. So it doesn't sound like the utilities are all that dedicated to driving those stockpiles down that aggressively if they are replenishing still fairly aggressively there in the third quarter, just one more question, the U.S. dollar has been sitting at elevated levels relative to foreign currencies now for a year or longer what\u2019s your outlook on that for the rest of this year and throughout 2017 and the impact it might have on exports, which are so critical and sort of the bulk side of your business? Lance Fritz : Yes John, this is Lance. You are right, the dollar has been strong. We don't make prediction about what the dollar is going to be going forward, but you got to believe all reasonable expectations are it\u2019s going to remain strong. In order to change that you need real acceleration in the global market, which would enhance the strength of other currencies and there is just not a lot of catalyst that you see for that. To your point, a strong dollar does make exports difficult however. Even in today's world you see for instance grain exporting of Pacific North-west and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar, so market conditions can still prompt commodity movement in global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that. Where a couple of years ago people would say $70 a barrel shale oil was competitive and in today's world they say no that\u2019s maybe more like $50 a barrel. So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there, clearly we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports that all would be really helpful to us. John Larkin : Got it. Thanks for the explanation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Hi good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. Rob I know you guys don't want to get too much into predicting price, but maybe could you let us or clarify for us kind of what percentage of the volume right now is under contract or would have a normal inflationary escalator versus those that are going to be subject to more of the competitor over market conditions that are out there? Rob Knight : Yes David, I mean we don't necessarily break it out exactly where you are asking other than I would just remind that overall about 25% of our book of business is touched by the a list index, but to your question of how much do we have sort of under contract or if you will kind of sized from a pricing standpoint, it\u2019s a same answer I would have given you last quarter and that\u2019s about 70%. I mean every day of every week we are negotiating and with the customers and negotiating our deals, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s done each quarter on day one, so it\u2019s an ongoing continuous process and roughly speaking any day of any week we have about 70% of the next 12 months business under contract or sized up. David Vernon : And I guess as you think about kind of your outlooks in your sort of near term to 60 and then the longer term to G55+ does the recent trend in that same store sales price metric make you the CFO sort of rethink the timing of some of those targets or do you think that you see enough opportunity in the cost side here to keep the full momentum on the margin side? Rob Knight : Yes we haven't changed our guidance in terms of a 60 plus or minus by 2019 and then our eyeballs on getting to a 55 and I would just say, don't read that we are like changing longer-term view in terms of our commitment to pricing, we\u2019re not. I mean we\u2019ve got a little bit of the bump off the road because of some of the market conditions that Eric outlined, but as we look longer-term the levers that got us to where we are today that are going to take us to that next rung on the ladder of 60 then eventually 55 or certainly we hope positive volume, but are going to be solid value to our customers, solid core pricing at re-investable levels plus and solid productivity gains. David Vernon : Alright, well I appreciate the color on that it's been a long call. Thanks for your time and we look forward to hearing more about those G55+ initiatives over the coming years. Lance Fritz : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead with your questions. Ben Hartford : Thanks. Rob quick question for you, you had provided the 15% revenue target that you had talked about in the past for next year, as it relates to Capex, can you envision as you march toward the 55% OR target longer term, can you envision the situation in which Capex does approach D&A on an absolute basis, is that realistic for a relevant period of time or a relevant time horizon? Rob Knight : Ben, probably not, I wouldn't use that as a marker again because of the timing and these are long live assets generally speaking, but to your broader point, I\u2019m very proud of what the team has done to continue to make progress on tightening our capital discipline and I think it\u2019s a significant step of getting to that 15%-ish range if you will from where we have historically been. I mean there\u2019s a lot of great productivity and a lot of great work that goes into getting to that level. So, we will get to that rung next and then we\u2019ll see where we are at that point. Ben Hartford : Okay, that's helpful thanks. Operator : Our next question if from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So, just on the OR long term your targets as you mentioned, when we started the year we heard the entire, all the railroads each indicate that they would be able to reduce OR despite a challenging environment, you noted the same, most of done so and your OR unfortunately has not followed that trend and I am just looking on a relative basis, when you see the improvement across the group, is it - can you point to something that is specific to your company that be it a business mix, be it some structural challenges that lead you to have that challenge that the others did not and I frame it in a relative question, I know you don\u2019t like looking at peers, but I know your investor do, so I want to be able to understand is there something company specific here or how do you I answer that question when I get that OR question? Lance Fritz : Yeah Walter, this is Lance. So, again I won\u2019t compare ourselves to our peers. We are a unique railroad. When we began the year, we were hopeful we were going to make OR improvement. The topline went away from us as Rob said a little more aggressively than we had anticipated. If you think about our ability to improve OR over the long run we are still confident that we can do it that\u2019s shown in our - maintaining the guidance for a plus minus 60 in 2019. We did start the year with very low operating ratio, it\u2019s still an attractive operating ratio, we\u2019re not pleased that we didn't have the opportunity to improve it this year and again we are just laser focused on all the activity necessary to continue to improve our margins for our shareholders. Walter Spracklin : So coming back to your long-term then, I mean from where you sit today, I mean that\u2019s a 900 basis point improvement, it\u2019s a significant improvement many - several of your peers are there already and many investors are banking on you to achieve that, given the trends that we are exhibiting the reversals on those trends, I'm just trying to understand what confidence that we can be put in a reasonable timeframe, a long-term is a fairly vague definition, a reasonable time frame for evolution toward a 55 OR. Lance Fritz : Rob why don't you take that? Rob Knight : Yes Walter, I guess I would remind you and everyone that we are confident in sticking with our 60 plus or minus target OR by full-year 2019 and as you have heard us talk with eyes on where do we go beyond that to the 55, so while we have put a date on the 55, but I would just say that getting to a 60 is a very enviable spot in my opinion, I mean we\u2019ve made great progress on that. So, I would not read that this one year of perhaps not making OR improvement is a new trend or a new objective or new signal here, it\u2019s not, I mean to get from where we are today to that 60 is going to take all the initiatives we just talked about and it is the same levers that got us 25 point improvement over the last decade. So, we're going to continue to make that progress and we haven't backed off our 60 OR guidance. Walter Spracklin : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Konigsberg : Yes, hi good morning, thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has already been covered, maybe just on the bonus depreciation and moving some of the purchases on locomotives from 2016 to 2017, so should we just think of the those two are connected and the carry over into 2017 will show up? Rob Knight : I think I would stick with the guidance I gave on bonus depreciation impact this year of about $350 million. I don't think that\u2019s not going to move much. We haven't finalized what the number is going to look like all in for 2017, but I think I would still just kind of use that assumption of 350-ish for this year. Brian Konigsberg : But conceptually a lot of that bonus depreciation is associated with the purchases of locomotives and is that just the way to think about it generally? Rob Knight : Yes, I mean it certainly impacts that, but I would say it\u2019s still in that 350 range for this year and again we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll get some - got carryover benefit next year, but we of course have to start paying back previous year, so we haven't finalized we are giving guidance as to what the impact all in net will be next year, but you are right, I mean the locomotive moment will have some impact on what those numbers are? Brian Konigsberg : Understood, thanks. And maybe just touch a little bit on balance sheet, so you are approaching the self imposed leverage limits you talked about, just thought process from here you look to maybe deliver or actively deliver or will you naturally do a three EBITDA growth, how do you see that playing out? Rob Knight : Yeah, I mean actually we've made great progress on that measure over the last several years and at this point in time the biggest opportunity we still have in front of us, which we are laser focused on is driving EBITDA, driving cash flow, and that will give us additional capacity and that\u2019s how we are approaching it. So, we've either do have room as we grow our earnings and grow our cash flow. Brian Konigsberg : I will leave it there, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. With regard, just focusing on the automotive sector, you mentioned the contract changes being a headwind in the 2017, could you just kind of compare and contrast what you think the impact will be as it looks like over the row conversions are good and then obviously there\u2019s a lot of near shoring and lot of development in Mexico and with manufacturing so just if you could compare and contrast within that sector, how you think it, you enter next year, is it going to be a net up or down in that category thanks? Rob Knight : You know Scott, we love our autos franchise, we think we have the premier autos franchise. We think all of the trends in terms of Mexico production is positive for us. In terms of our franchise we think we are in a great spot for over the road auto parts conversions, we have great success this year and we think they will continue in the future. There will always be contract changes and it\u2019s a competitive marketplace and we saw that\u2019s a share and that\u2019s something that will happen across time. The big driver as we\u2019ve been saying my view on the automotive side is the cautionary impact in terms of sales. Sales have been at record or near record levels and there are some indicators out there that should give cautionary lights, it\u2019s the amount of debt inherence in auto loans and leases. Actual sales incentives per car were at an all time record level in the quarter. The highest since 2008 was the previous record, so there is some cautionary signs out there, if auto sales stay strong we have a great franchise and we are in a great spot, I do think there are some cautionary signs out there? Scott Schneeberger : Okay thanks, and just a quick follow on, on Panama Canal, any update there, what are you hearing from customers just [indiscernible]. Thanks so much guys. Rob Knight : No, I think the Panama Canal story is what we\u2019ve been saying for the last several years and certainly I think the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve been mentioning that the amount of traffics hitting the West Coast versus the East Coast did - there was traffic that moved to the East Coast because of the strike and BCO\u2019s trying to diversify their risk and not be dependent upon the West Coast. We did see that phenomena. We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn\u2019t all come back from before the strike. That has probably been a larger factor than any Canal opening factor. The fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows and a lot of ways just to not have that risk. Having said all of that we do believe, I do believe that the West Coast ports are the most economical, the best supply chain in terms of transit time to get goods from Asia to the interior of the country and even into the East Coast. And if you look at some of the technologies at some of the West Coast ports are employee to make themselves more efficient or timing this vehicles and things like that, I think West Coast ports are still going to be positioned to be the best supply chain factor going into the future though you will see people running to do risk mitigation strategies. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you Rob, and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We\u2019re looking forward to another conversation with you in January. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to the Union Pacific's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you and good morning everybody and welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarters earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer, and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd also like to introduce our new Chief Marketing Officer, Beth Whited. Some of you may recall Beth as our Investor Relations officer several years ago. Most recently, she was the leader of our chemicals group. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.39 per share, which compares to $1.31 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 3% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, while agricultural product volumes were up 8%, as grain shipments continued to be strong in the quarter. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62%, a 1.2 percentage point improvement from the fourth quarter of last year, and about flat with the third quarter of this year. Outstanding productivity achievements along with positive core pricing helped to partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While full year volumes were down substantially year-over-year, we did see declines moderate in the fourth quarter. As we work through the challenges of the year, we remain focused on the strategy we live each day through our six value tracks. The first value track we show is world-class safety, and I'm very pleased to report that Union Pacific had a record safety year in 2016, with our reportable injury rate improving 14% versus 2015. Executing on these value tracks enables us to run a safe, efficient and productive railroad while providing our customers an excellent value proposition. Our team will give you more of the details on the quarter, starting with Beth. Beth Whited : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the fourth quarter our volume was down 3%, with near record agricultural product shipments more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. We generated positive net core pricing gains of 1% in the quarter with gains offset by challenges, predominantly in our energy-related and international intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that align with our value proposition. The decline in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 1% decline in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue gained 7% on an 8% volume increase, and flat average revenue per car. Grain carloads increased 22%, as a robust US grain supply and lower commodity prices enabled the US to be more competitive worldwide, resulting in record export volumes. Grain products carloads declined 2%, as a reduction in meal shipments, was partially offset by strength in biofuels. Food and refrigerated volumes were down 1%, driven by production changes in our canned and paste market, partially offset by strength in import beer. Looking forward to 2017, we expect high global grain inventories and the strong US dollar to put some pressure on the export grain market. Weather and global crop health will also continue to be factors. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will continue to see strength from refrigerated food growth and import beer. In autos, revenue was down 6% in the quarter on a 3% decline in volume, and a 3% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 6%, as a result of contract changes we have previously referenced that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017. These changes were partially offset by increased production and imports, driven by strong fourth quarter demand. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 18 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, the third highest quarterly sales pace on record. Light truck sales continued to outpace passenger vehicles in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 2% increase in volume. For 2017, we anticipate sustained demand levels with consistent economic fundamentals and consumer preferences. However, we continue to be cautious due to high inventory levels, dealership incentives, and rising interest rates. On the parts side, however, over-the-road conversions will continue to present new opportunities for additional growth. Chemicals revenue was flat for the quarter on a 5% decrease in volume, and 4% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 71%, due to the lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences, and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume excluding crude oil shipments was up 1% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas including plastics, which was up 11% in the quarter due to lower commodity prices that drove demand in both domestic and export markets. Looking forward, our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable. Strength is anticipated in plastics, with new facilities and expansions coming online to help offset the continued declines we expect to see in crude oil. Coal revenue declined 6% for the quarter on a 9% decrease in volume, and 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Volumes continued to come in closer to year-ago levels. Powder River Basin tonnage fell 16%, while other regions surged 24%. A mild start to the winter, coupled with higher than normal coal inventory levels hindered Powder River Basin volumes. Strength in export shipments drove the improved other region results. We expect coal volumes will be up in the first part of 2017, driven by favorable 2016 comps. The market will continue to be influenced by natural gas prices and weather. Industrial products revenue was down 2% on a 5% decline in volume, and a 4% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 1% in the quarter, driven by a 10% increase in frac sand shipments through improved market conditions. Construction products volume was down 8% due to weather, and softened rock demand in South Texas. The strong US dollar, weak commodity pricing, and increased imports pushed metal shipments down 5%. Looking forward we are anticipating strength in frac sand shipments. A strong US dollar could continue to impact our metals markets. Intermodal revenue was flat on a 1% decline in volume, and 1% increase in average revenue per car. Excluding the impact of the Hanjin bankruptcy, intermodal volume would have been up 2%. Domestic volume grew 2% in the quarter. Stronger fourth quarter retail sales led to growth in both premium and truckload business. International volumes were down 4% in the quarter as the industry continued to face headwinds from weaker global trade, overcapacity, ocean carrier financial stress and consolidations. Excluding the Hanjin bankruptcy, international would have been up 3% in the quarter. We expect international intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by ocean carrier challenges this year. Consumer confidence will continue to impact overall intermodal volume growth. To wrap up, slide 12 recaps our outlook for 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. We anticipate strength in several of our business teams, particularly agricultural products, coal and industrial products. Our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth this year, as the US economy slowly builds momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to strengthening our customer value proposition, and cultivating new business opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron Scott : Thanks Beth and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 14% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75%. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results, as we improve toward our goal of zero incidents. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate of 3.02 decreased 3% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that did not meet the reportable threshold, generating a record low incident rate for the sixth consecutive year. At public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 7% versus 2015 to 2.43. Union Pacific has launched a new initiative, the crossing assessment process or CAP, to enhance grade crossing safety in our communities. CAP will couple our comprehensive safety culture with new data analysis to help focus increased attention on the crossings where we can most substantially impact public safety. This big data approach allows us to utilize predictive analysis to identify crossings where incidents may be more likely to occur. CAP will be most successful in enhancing crossing safety, with the engaged participation of roadway authorities. Communication and coordination with public agencies is critical to success. Moving on to network performance. Once again, we generated solid operating results through the fourth quarter. As reported to the AAR, velocity declined 2%, while terminal dwell improved 1% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Our consistent operating performance has also translated into fewer recrews, lessening the resource demands of our network. The 2.4% recrew rate achieved in the fourth quarter matched last year's fourth quarter record. And for the year, we achieved a best-ever recrew rate of 2.2%. Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we are experiencing at that time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 7% in the fourth quarter, when compared to the same period in 2015. Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down a combined 900 employees or 4%. The active locomotive fleet was down 5% from the fourth quarter of 2015. As always, we continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet, as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to efficiently right-sizing our resource base, we continued realizing gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. Our relentless focus on productivity led to best-ever train size performance in 2016, as we achieved annual records in our manifest, grain, automotive and coal networks. Turning to our capital investments. In total, we invested just under $3.5 billion in our 2016 capital program. For 2017, we are targeting around $3.1 billion, pending final approval of our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2017 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. You may recall from our third quarter call, that we're planning on acquiring 100 locomotives in 2017 as part of a previous purchase commitment. Our 2017 capital plan now includes about 60 locomotives, with the remainder being delayed into 2018. We also plan to invest an additional $300 million in positive train control. Looking to 2017, our operating strategy is built on initiatives that will drive continuous improvement across our network. Above all, this includes safety, where we once again expect record results on our way towards zero incidents. And we will remain agile, adjusting resources to demand, while maintaining focus on other productivity initiatives to further reduce cost, enhance the customer experience, and continue creating value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks and good morning. Let\u2019s start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 1% versus last. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion. The volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 3% improvement compared to last year. Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, a 2% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $40 million, up from $28 million in 2015. Interest expense of $174 million was up 6%, compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense increased about 3% to $687 million, driven primarily by higher pre- tax earnings. Net income totaled over $1.1 billion, up 2% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance, declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share. Now turning to the topline, fright revenue of $4.8 billion was down 1% versus last year, primarily driven by a 3% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $187 million, down $31 million when compared to 2015, but up $14 million from the third quarter. All in, we estimate a net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.03 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter was a positive 1.5%. Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and a reduction in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to this mix, while more than offset declines in finished vehicles. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1%. Let me just take a minute to level-set what this core price reflects. Our core price is essentially a yield calculation. For starters, it excludes fuel surcharge revenue. It takes this quarter's impact from pricing actions over the past 12 months, and divides that benefit by the quarterly freight revenue base from the previous year. In other words, it calculates what we actually yielded from our pricing actions during the current quarter. This is the way we have consistently reported core price over the 13 years that I've been the CFO, and I think it's the best way to see what is actually yielded from our pricing actions. Our fourth quarter core price reflects the continued impact of a challenging competitive marketplace in energy and international intermodal, as Beth had indicated earlier. Pricing in other areas has actually been holding up fairly well. In fact, if you exclude coal and international intermodal from the calculation, our core price on the rest of our business lines would be in the neighborhood of about 2% to 3%. Given these market dynamics, our core pricing will continue to be challenged throughout the first part of 2017 before beginning to strengthen later in the year, assuming market conditions improve. That said, I want to reiterate that our pricing philosophy has not changed. We will continue to price our service product based on the value proposition that it represents in the competitive marketplace, at levels that generate re-investable returns. This should result in real core pricing gains, and contribute toward improving margins over the longer term. Turning now to our operating expenses, Slide 22 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 3% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. These decreases were partially offset by the labor inflation, which was about 2.5% in the quarter. Full-year labor inflation came in about 2%, while our overall inflation was about 1.5%. As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 5% in the quarter year-over-year or almost 2,300 employees. For the full-year our average work force level was down almost 10% year-over-year. For 2017, we do expect force levels to adjust with volume, but will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives as well. Fuel expense totaled $431 million, up 2% when compared to 2015. Higher diesel fuel prices on essentially the same gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price increased 2% to $2.65 per gallon. Purchase, services, and materials expense decreased 6% to $553 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Turning now to Slide 23, Depreciation expense was $520 million, up 1% compared to 2015. For the full-year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $280 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and benefits from productivity initiatives were more than enough to offset price increases. Other expenses came in at $233 million, about flat with last year. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly, excluding any unusual items. Slide 24, provides a summary of our 2016 earnings, with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $1.9 billion to $19.9 billion. Operating income totaled almost $7.3 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to 2015. And net income was just over $4.2 billion while earnings per share were down 8% to $5.07 per share. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the year totaled just over $7.5 billion, up about $180 million when compared to last year. The increase in cash was primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending, which more than offset the decline in net income. Looking ahead to 2017, the net impact of bonus depreciation will be a headwind of about $100 million, as the 2017 benefit is more than offset by cash required for the repayment of prior year programs. This net impact assumes no changes to the current tax laws. Our capital spending program for 2016 totaled just under $3.5 billion down 19% or $800 million from 2015. Return on invested capital was 12.7 in 2016, down 1.6 points from 2015, driven primarily by lower earnings. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels the all-in-adjusted debt balance increased to $17.9 billion at year-end. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times up from 1.7 at year-end 2105. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than two times. Dividend payments for the year totaled nearly $1.9 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year and this includes a 10% dividend increase which occurred in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, 2015 dividend payments also included the fourth quarter of 2014 dividend of $438 million which we paid in 2015. In addition to dividends we also bought back over 35 million shares totaling about $3.1 billion representing 4% over of our outstanding shares during 2016. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased just over 29% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $5 billion to our shareholders for the year, which represented 118% of 2016's net income. Before I talk about 2017, let me take a minute to tell you how core price and productivity stacked up against our inflation costs. First of all, our core price for the full year averaged 1.5% for 2016. This generated a pricing benefit that significantly exceeded rail inflation costs, which came in at about 1.5% for the year. Now remember, of course, that inflation is on a different base. Remember that we exclude depreciation, fuel, and equipment rents from our rail inflation calculation. On the productivity side, our G55 and Zero initiatives really took hold though out the year. These initiatives produced significant productivity benefits totaling approximately $450 million in 2016, which was also well in excess of our rail inflation costs. That's a big number, which reflects an enormous effort on our entire organization's part that got us behind the drive for improvement, from labor savings, to lower material costs, to operating efficiencies. Looking ahead to 2017. Volumes in the first quarter should turn slightly positive, and pricing will continue to be challenged as we mentioned earlier. We should see momentum pick up throughout the year, and we expect full year car loading growth to be up in the low single-digit range. This will be driven largely by more stable coal volumes, which will also see the benefit of easier comps year-over-year. We should also see some strength in other areas, such as domestic intermodal and agricultural products. As for inflation, we expect 2017 inflation will be around 3%, which will equate to a cost that is significantly higher than the inflation was in 2016. Given this higher cost and the current pricing challenges, the gap between inflation cost and pricing yield will narrow considerably this year. While exceeding inflation, our core pricing yield will be more challenging this year, but we still expect to achieve that goal. And on the productivity side, we should well exceed inflation again in 2017. We plan to achieve approximately $350 million to $400 million of savings this year as we continue our intense focus on our G55 and Zero initiatives. This will turbo charge our margins and returns. So when you add it all up positive volume, solid core price, and significant productivity benefits will all contribute to improved full year operating ratio. We finished 2016 with an operating ratio of 63.5%, and we are well on our target towards a 60% plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And longer term, we are still focused on the goal of a 55% operating ratio, as we continue the momentum of our G55 and Zero initiatives. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you Rob. As we discussed today, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results in a difficult volume environment. Looking to 2017, we feel pretty good about some of the macro-economic indicators that drive our core business. Higher energy prices, favorable agricultural markets and improving business and consumer confidence all support a return to positive volume growth this year. As always, a new year will bring its share of change and uncertainty. We'll be closely monitoring the impacts of potential developments in areas such as corporate tax reform and commerce with our trading partners around the world, as well as the overall strength of the economy. We continue to have confidence in the strength and diversity of the Union Pacific franchise, which will position us well to safely and efficiently leverage stronger volumes as our markets begin to rebound. We will continue to execute on our strategic value tracks to provide our customers an excellent service experience while generating strong returns for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to start with a question on the OR. I know you said you expect an improvement for the full year, but is there any color you could provide on the quarterly progression of the OR? And specifically in the first quarter with a slight increase anticipated to volumes, do you believe the OR can improve in 1Q? Lance Fritz : Rob, you want to take that? Rob Knight : Yes, Justin, as I said in my comments, we're confident in our ability to drive full year improvement in the operating ratio. And we haven't given specific guidance by quarter, but clearly, it can and likely will be lumpy. And one of the points that you're raising, is in the first quarter alone, remember that we did get \u2013 last year in the first quarter, a fuel \u2013 favorable fuel benefit. So just kind of looking at that alone, that by itself will present likely a challenge as it relates to the operating ratio. So it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But we're focused on the longer term improvement driving the levers that we can, in fact impact over the longer term. Justin Long : Okay. Got it. And maybe one on pricing. So if I think about your commentary, it seems like the message is the pricing environment has likely bottomed in the fourth quarter, and should get incrementally better throughout 2017. So first of all, would you agree with that statement? And second of all, when you think about your guidance to price above inflation, how much visibility do you have to that today? What are \u2013 how many contracts have you already repriced for 2017? Lance Fritz : Hey, Justin, this is Lance. So we don't give forward price guidance, so we are not going to call a bottom. You heard Beth's commentary about the markets that we compete in. There are some headwinds that continue into next year, most notably in the first half of the year. And what we're hopeful for is that as the markets firm, it creates a more attractive pricing environment for us as the year progresses. I think I'll let Rob answer the second part of the question. Rob Knight : Yes, Justin, I guess, I would just kind of build on Lance's point. We don't give specific guidance as Lance pointed out, but we are \u2013 take one message from us here, that while inflation's rising, while we have some challenges in the marketplace as it relates to pricing, we are still committed to pricing at reinvestable levels that are above the overall inflation costs in the year. And that could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter certainly, but we're committed and driven just as we always have been on doing that. And I don't recall, frankly what the follow-up question was. Oh, the visibility. Yes, I mean, Justin\u2026 Justin Long : The visibility, yes. Rob Knight : I guess, I would answer that, you've heard me say this many times. No matter what day of the week, or what day of the year you would ask, what looking forward what percentage of our business we have sort of in the book, if you will \u2013 and it's lumpy because we're negotiating deals every day of the week throughout the year, we look at somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of our business. Justin Long : Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Really appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to sort of think about 2017, and kind of operating leverage. You've outlined, Rob, a couple of things there, and thank you by the way for the clarification on core price versus inflation. I think it's helpful people understand that. When you think about the gap narrowing a bit, in particularly the first half of the year, but volume kind of coming back, how should we think about all of those inputs into incremental margins historically? And sort of a volume growth dynamic coming out of a downturn, you've been able to generate some pretty solid incremental margins, and to get to your long-term targets, you need solid incremental margins. Just want to get a sense, just sort of how we might be thinking about that relative to historical performance when you look at 2017? Rob Knight : Yes, Chris. As you probably could guess, we don't give and have never given incremental margin guidance but I would just say this. That to get from where we are today to our ultimate target, and if you know we're driving towards \u2013 the organization's driving towards a 55% OR but to get from there, to the 60% by 2019 and then beyond that to the 55%, requires that on an annualized basis you get somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% incremental margin on volume growth. So it clearly will be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on other factors but that's kind of the way I think about it. We've got sort of an over the longer period of time that 50% give or take is generally speaking what it's going to take to drive to our objectives. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up question. From a volume standpoint, when you think about the international intermodal piece of the business just broadly speaking \u2013 and that has been a bit of a headwind from a core pricing standpoint, and volumes have been, I guess, not necessarily fantastic there. I guess, as you think about that as you look out, when maybe do we see that dynamic start to turn? Do you need to see sort of just more broadly positive volumes across the industry, to start to see that capacity kind of tighten up? But or is it something that, as you lap some of these contract losses over the course of the next several quarters, maybe you could start to see that change a bit? I guess, I just want to get an understanding of maybe how we see the international intermodal business playing out over the next several quarters? Lance Fritz : Beth, you want to take that? Beth Whited : Sure. I think the alliances that are happening right now in that international intermodal space are still evolving. There's still a very significant surplus capacity in the marketplace. There's clearly some competition going on between the Panama and the Suez Canal and all of those things are going to play out over the course of the months and quarters ahead and our focus really is going to be on making sure that we have the best service product to handle that business as it comes to us. Lance Fritz : Chris, there's a couple of moving parts there. One is the state of the Trans-Pacific industry itself, the ocean carrier market itself. The other is what's going on with U.S. consumer confidence and consumption. And both are moving parts as you look forward. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. So it seems like the mix actually started to turn a little bit positive. And I know you talked a lot about core price and not giving guidance on that. But I guess as you think about the setup for the next three, six, nine, 12 months, it does look like with growth in frac sand, maybe little bit of a less headwind in coal and maybe growth in some of the chemicals business that the mix number we should expect that to continue to be positive coming into 2017. Is that fair? Lance Fritz : Rob, you want to take that? Rob Knight : Yes, David, again, If I sound like a broken record. You heard me say this many times. We would hope that all that plays out as you define. But we've given up trying to give guidance on what mix is going to be because again, I would say probably us more than most we are in so many diverse markets which is a huge strength in the. UP franchise that there's a lot of moving parts and there's a lot of mix within commodity groups. So I would be reluctant to give any kind of guidance on what mix is going to look like going forward. David Vernon : Okay. And then, I guess, as you think about the upside, Beth, on the frac sand business, you mentioned the volumes are kind of trending up 10% here. We've heard some anecdotal evidence that sand prices are also rallying. Would you \u2013 should we expect some better pricing in that business as well, kind of directionally \u2013 and not looking for specific numbers or percentages, just trying to get a sense for, kind of how you guys think about your value proposition into an improving demand for drilling materials, which seem to be routed on your network from Wisconsin to the Permian? Beth Whited : As you know, we don't really give any sort of market specific pricing guidance. But I would say that we're pretty excited about the inflection point we saw in the rigs and them kind of coming up slowly over the second half of last year. A lot of the growth is coming in the Permian Basin which is a strength point in our franchise. So we do expect to see good year-over-year comps in frac sand as the year progresses. David Vernon : All right, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question. Danny Schuster : Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our question. We were hoping to dig in a little bit to the chemicals business. So Beth, I know you mentioned that you'll continue to see headwinds on the crude side. And I think your slides imply that it dipped into the mid single-digit thousand volume range this quarter. So I was just wondering first, is that kind of the right range to model going forward into next year on a quarterly basis? Beth Whited : On to the crude oil business will continue to move away from us. As you know, the production is down, pricing is very difficult. There's more pipeline capacity coming along and that will just continue to go away from us as we progress throughout the year, down 71% in the last quarter, probably going to continue to see it fall away. Danny Schuster : Okay. But getting to the point where it it's almost inconsequential at this point and then on the flip side\u2026 Beth Whited : I would call it pretty inconsequential, yes. Danny Schuster : And then on the flip side, you have some new facilities coming on the plastic side. I think your slides implied that you had about \u2013 you were moving about 60,000 to 70,000 carloads of plastic a year, a quarter, each quarter this year. How much could the new plastics facilities add and when should we expect to see those come online? Beth Whited : There's a lot of uncertainties and what's going to happen as those facilities come online. And they will start to come on let's call it second half of 2017 and kind of throughout into 2020. It's still unclear how much of that product will move domestically. How much of that product will go to export markets. As it goes to export markets will it leave directly from the Port of Houston. Will it come into an inner point for packaging and then go off to the West Coast. So I don't think we have any prediction to give you there. We're just pretty excited that our Gulf Coast franchise gives us the opportunity to reach a lot of those plastics facilities and we intend to participate to the degree that we're asked to. Danny Schuster : Okay, great. And is the revenue per unit profile similar to kind of the overall business that you have today? Beth Whited : I don't think we're going to make a comment on that. Danny Schuster : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Rob, I can understand the challenge of forecasting mix but maybe you or Beth as you look at the high level portfolio of the business you look at, can you give a sense of what percentage of the business is really sensitive to the U.S. dollar, both on an exports and import side including metals, grain and coal you mentioned before. And if I remember from prior fact books I think you\u2019d highlighted roughly about 15% of revenue was tied to exports. So any updated numbers there would be appreciated. Lance Fritz : Hey, Brian. This is Lance. I'll let Beth talk specifically to our international business and what our business looks like in terms of cross-border trade. But in terms of trying to get a sense for how much of our business is sensitive to the U.S. dollar, the answer to that is there's a fair amount of our commodity mix with lots of moving parts that either benefits from a strong dollar or gets hurt by a strong dollar. So you could essentially say to the extent that a dollar and its value internationally impacts the U.S. consumer and U.S. industry, our total book has some exposure to that. But I'll let Beth talk about our international book specifically. Beth Whited : So I think you probably heard us quote some numbers before but just as a refresher, about 40% of our business is international with a fair portion of that being Mexico and then the rest being truly global business. And we do as you said see a lot of grain in that. Clearly there's other grain products as well as a number of our industrial products that participate in that global market. Probably a big chunk is also in the vehicles and parts, mostly going back and forth from Mexico. And so there's some puts and takes with that over time because you'll see some things that are advantaged as you're in a strong dollar position but we certainly have seen some challenges with competitive products worldwide really competing against products that are made in the United States. Brian Ossenbeck : Right, right. Yes, I can certainly appreciate the complexity. And I guess, to follow up with even more complexity, and when we look at the cross-border stuff you mentioned going to and from Mexico, and talk of the GOP's border adjusted taxes tied into the corporate tax reform. How do you kind of size the risk potentially, if that were to come into play, and what are you hearing from customers? Do you have any sort of scenario analysis that you're trying to work through now, if that were to come into effect as written? I know it's still early, and we hear a new thing each day, seemingly from President-elect Trump and the GOP. But just how you're thinking about that piece of the network would be helpful? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Sure. So we are paying close attention to all of the talk about potential outcomes as we go forward in terms of impact on either NAFTA or other international trade agreements. Our perspective is that the United States is tightly woven with its trading partners and our consumers benefit greatly from free and open international trade, both from a standard of living perspective, making goods available to them at lower cost than they would be otherwise, as well as creating markets for U.S. goods to be sold into, creating a robust potential growth for U.S. jobs and typically the higher paying U.S. jobs. When we look at the cross-border trade let's say specifically with Mexico, when you really dig deep, you see that a large percentage, certainly more than half, a lion's share has value added on both sides of the border and is inextricably linked to our economy. So we've been giving that kind of feedback to our elected officials and regulators for a long time. We'll continue to give them that kind of feedback. And we are prepared and preparing for any of the potential outcomes that might occur. But bottom line, we're optimistic that those decisions ultimately will benefit U.S. trade and the U.S. economy. Brian Ossenbeck : Great. Thanks, Lance, appreciate the thoughts. Lance Fritz : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So Rob, just I apologize if I'm slow, I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying on pricing. So if I'm understanding right, you're saying that the dollars from pricing this year will be above the dollars of cost inflation, but don't necessarily expect the headline pricing number to be 3% or better? Is that is kind of what you're saying? Rob Knight : Look Scott, I didn't gave and we won't give the specific percentage increase guidance, but yes, our message is that with the challenges that Beth has outlined in some of our markets and favorable pricing we are still enjoying in the other markets, you combine that against a higher inflation expectation, of course that's calculated as you know on a different base, that our dollars we yield, which is how we calculate our price, the dollars we yield from pricing in 2017 we expect to be above the dollars we expend in the inflation buckets, albeit potentially and likely narrower gap than we saw in 2016. Scott Group : Okay. And given that narrower gap, do you think \u2013 is the path to that 60% operating ratio, does that naturally then become more back-end loaded in 2018 and 2019, or not necessarily? Rob Knight : No, I wouldn't say that. Again, it will be lumpy, but I would say as we have said all along, going back even the days of Project 75, if you look at the progression that we've made, it really is the same levers that we have at our disposal and that's volume, pricing to market, and productivity. And those three levers are still the levers that we wake up every day pushing to our advantage. But they will be lumpy and sometimes markets dictate how much of that lever you're able to pull from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year but I would not say that that changes our \u2013 certainly doesn't change our focus and our commitment to getting to that 60% but from quarter-to-quarter all of those levers can result in a lumpiness between here and there. But we are very focused on that and I would say that a big part of the success that we are enjoying, have been enjoying here of late is that turbo charged if you will productivity result. Scott Group : Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly, for you, Rob or maybe Cameron, did you guys say what you think headcount is going to be in the first quarter, and the year? And do you think we need to start thinking about a more meaningful step-up in resources, as some of the service metrics start to see a little bit of pressure? Lance Fritz : Rob, why don't you take that? Rob Knight : Yes, Scott. We haven't given guidance on certainly not quarterly guidance on operating ratio. But I would tell you that Cam and his team\u2026 Scott Group : Sorry, headcount. Rob Knight : On headcount, I'm sorry, did I say\u2026 Lance Fritz : Whatever you said, headcount. Rob Knight : Yes, on headcount. But I would tell you that with Cam and his team and the entire organization's continued focus and commitment on productivity we are confident in our ability as volume hopefully recovers to continue to squeeze out productivity. Having said that, I would expect that certainly for the full year 2017, as I said earlier, our headcount will move up or down with volume. We hope it's up. We hope volume's positive but not one for one because there is still an assumption of continued turbo charging our productivity. We are in a position of being very ready if you will with our resources to absorb the single-digit growth in volume that we're anticipating this year. By the way, not just headcount but that stands true for locomotives as well. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Rob Knight : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, good morning, guys. And also, thank you for the detail on pricing versus inflation going into 2017. Just a couple of follow-ups there. So if inflation is going to go up by 150 basis points this year, and pricing is to be above inflation, that means your pricing probably goes up by something to that magnitude, although you're not formally saying that. If pricing was to improve from here, what are the end markets that will drive it? Are these the same end markets that have been driving the weakness so far? Lance Fritz : Let\u2019s \u2013 of course by not commenting, we're not giving guidance on your first presumptive statement. So let\u2019s just set that aside. And then Beth, why don't you talk about what markets look like as you're moving into 2017. Beth Whited : Yes, as we think about 2017, we will still continue to see some challenges in places like coal and international intermodal. But we would expect to get some momentum as the markets improve with the economy growing. Additionally, as the year progresses, the trucks and our competitors are going to face some challenges with electronic logbooks and hours of service regulations coming into play, which may also provide us with an opportunity. Rob Knight : Ravi, if I can just \u2013 this is Rob. Just kind of back to the first part of your question, I just want to make sure I am clear on what you were suggesting. Lance is right, we're not going to give specific pricing guidance but I would just clarify. That we are not saying don't take from what I have said about our pricing plans against inflation for 2017 as being any kind of an indicator of whether that means pricing's going up or down. I mean what we're saying is that we are still committed to that pricing yield dollar being above the inflation expense but I did say we do anticipate that that gap of the yield above inflation dollars will narrow in 2017. So I didn't say what the pricing will be. And I would not take that to mean pricings going up at some X amount. Ravi Shanker : Okay. I think I understand, but I'll probably follow up offline anyway. Just one follow-up on the call though. When you consider kind of all the factors that are kind of pressuring pricing today, and also the factors driving \u2013 I don't want to say a potential rebound in 2017, but let's say that comes. Are there any UNP specific factors here, or do you think that this is an industry-wide phenomenon, in terms of what you're seeing out there? Lance Fritz : This is Lance. I'll attempt to take that. So the factors that impact pricing are essentially the market factors that Beth had talked about. We have a market we compete in, many markets we compete in across commodity groups. And what we've said is we're fairly optimistic as we look into 2017. First and foremost, on coal, primarily because of easier comps. But there are some other market dynamics that we're going into the year with a stronger grain and ag products market than we had entering 2016. Arguably construction markets should be firming up as there's talk of infrastructure and as we see the housing markets improve. Consumer confidence and business confidence appears to be growing, so that looks like that could create some opportunity. So bottom line is as our served markets improve, that should create an environment where we have more pricing opportunity. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning, and great job on the performance, and the OR for the quarter. But, I guess, Beth, maybe you can just talk a little bit more about coal, given the easier comps that we're facing, particularly in the first half? Can you talk a bit about where inventories are, how much they've come down, and kind of what your view is on how pricing is right now? Are you in the money? Are you seeing demand pick up at this point? Beth Whited : So we have seen what I call a very modest fall-off in inventory levels. We're at around 93 days of inventory which is still call it 80 days above historical levels. So still kind of a challenging stockpile environment. We are, though, in a little different situation than we were in part \u2013 in most of 2016, where we have natural gas prices that are considerably higher, $3.40-ish, where last year we spent most of the year in the $2s and even a part of the year under $2. So that gives us some potential for our served plants to be more in the money, and able to burn coal. So the weather of course is going to play a role in it in parts of our network and served plants are experiencing some nice cold winter and we love that. So if you kind of put that all together, we've got favorable comps, a better natural gas environment, stockpiles that are still a bit high, and weather is always going to be kind of the swing factor. Ken Hoexter : Just for comparable purposes, a quarter ago, a year ago, you had mentioned that inventories had come down a bit. Can you give us, from what level, to put that in perspective? Beth Whited : We were over 100 days at one point and I can't recall what they were in the first quarter of last year but it's not a substantial decline and it's still well above historic levels. Lance Fritz : Ken, bear in mind, there's two different measurements for inventory. One is an absolute measurement of how much tonnage do you have on the ground. That's moved more dramatically than what your days burn looks like and of course that's because burn has changed over time. Ken Hoexter : Okay. And I think, Beth, just keeping with you for a minute, for my follow-up on grain. Growth, I guess, decelerated here in the fourth quarter from what I guess, is still a record crop. Is there a reason why that is, and maybe your thoughts on that going forward? And then, same with yields, they were flat. Is, I guess, with demand being up, would \u2013 or I guess, printing average revenue per car, is that something, a shift between domestic export, or anything that would impact that? Beth Whited : We do have a pretty large carry-out in the ag markets and we still continue to see pretty strong shipments all through the fourth quarter going to export markets. So I\u2019m not sure what data you\u2019re referencing when you talk about it being down from third to fourth, but\u2026 Ken Hoexter : Till not down, just de-accelerating. Sorry. Beth Whited : Okay, sorry. Yes, it was \u2013 we had a very strong fourth quarter, huge carry-out remains in the market. I think the carry-out numbers are up something like 10% across the different grain categories versus year-ago levels. It\u2019s going to be impacted by the same thing it\u2019s always been impacting by, which is world grain capabilities, what kind of harvest we see in the United States this year and then of course this is an area where we do see impacts from the U.S. dollar strength. I don\u2019t know if I got all the pieces of your question. There were multiple parts there. Ken Hoexter : No, yes, it was just on the \u2013 that was the volume side. Just on the yield side I was just wondering why they would be flat in such a strong market. Is that a shift in mix that would cause pricing to be relatively flat year-on-year in terms of average revenue per car? Beth Whited : Okay. Sorry. I didn\u2019t catch that part. Yes, so our grain can move to market in a variety of different ways. It can move all the way by rail to the end destination. Sometimes we\u2019ll see situations where the river is very competitive. So we may move to the river and so that would be a shorter length of haul for us and that might drive some mix changes in the arc. But still very positive yields for us. We wouldn\u2019t say that moving a shorter distance necessarily changes the yield perspective. Ken Hoexter : That\u2019s wonderful. Thank you very much for the insight. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me in here. So I\u2019m not going to ask about pricing, because I think what\u2019s critical here is that you guys are guiding to an improved operating ratio in 2017. And Lance, I know you guys have been calling for that for the last two or three years, but it has been challenging with top line declining as much as it has. What is the confidence level in 2017 that we are in fact, going to see that improved margin? And Rob, I\u2019m going to try it, because if I just straight line your guidance to get to a 60% OR by 2019, I think that implies about 100, 110 basis points of improvement per year. Is there any reason why we shouldn\u2019t be thinking that\u2019s attainable, in a stronger growth environment that we might be seeing in 2017? Lance Fritz : So Brandon, I\u2019ll take the confidence level and then turn it over to Rob. We are confident that we\u2019re going to improve our operating ratio in 2017. The reason why is the three moving parts that we touch that Rob talked about; one is productivity. Rob\u2019s already talked about another strong year of productivity in 2017 and Cameron and the rest of the team have those projects in sight and already working on. That gives us confidence there. The second is pricing. We\u2019re going to take what the market gives in terms of pricing for the value that we represent. We\u2019re hopeful that the markets are firming a bit, so we\u2019re hopeful that the third element in terms of volume will cooperate a little bit more in 2017 and we\u2019ve guided to positive volumes in 2017. So we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to be able to improve the operating ratio. Rob Knight : Yes. Brandon, this is Rob. I would just add that we stay away from giving specific OR guidance, but your straight line math is right. But one thing we know is things aren\u2019t going to be straight line, but we\u2019re going to take advantage of every opportunity we have and if we can front end load that we will. If it ends up being lumpier than that or back ended because of factors in the marketplace, that\u2019s the way it will play out. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that feedback. And Cameron, can you just talk a little bit more about the productivity goal this year of $350 million to $400 million. I mean, is that mostly labor related as you think about volumes coming back and maybe not adding one for one? Cameron Scott : Well, your last comment is accurate as Rob mentioned, with the amount of furloughed employees we have as Beth brings on additional volume, we have people ready to take on that volume. And there\u2019s plenty of room on train side, so we expect to see additional volume come on the railroad without any additional starts as far as \u2013 whether it\u2019s purely labor based or other initiatives, most of it is other initiatives. Brandon Oglenski : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. Thank you. Let\u2019s see, Rob, at the risk of asking you something you\u2019ve talked about quite a bit here, just to fine-tune on what you did say on inflation for 2017, did you give us a specific expectation? Or you just said, it\u2019s going to be higher than the 1.5% inflation you had in 2016? I just want to make sure I understand that. Rob Knight : Yes. Tom, I actually said that we expect inflation to be in the neighborhood of 3% full year. Tom Wadewitz : And that\u2019s not just labor, that\u2019s total inflation? Rob Knight : That\u2019s total inflation, yes. Although labor, health and welfare are certainly drivers of that. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Okay. So that\u2019s 3%. In terms of intermodal, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve commented a lot on this. What\u2019s the view on intermodal volumes in 2017? You got a lot of moving parts. Do you have confidence that you\u2019ll see growth in the domestic piece, and is it reasonable to think the international is going to be down? Or how would you think about the two pieces, and what the outcome might be in terms of intermodal volumes, up a couple points, down a couple points, just kind of broad brush? Thank you. Beth Whited : Hey, Tom, it\u2019s nice to talk to you again. I would say that we feel really good about our ability to continue seeing domestic intermodal growth. We\u2019re very focused on highway conversions. We have an expectation that there could be some tightening truck capacity later in the year and that could be very beneficial to our intermodal market as well. On the international side, I think it\u2019s really hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen in international intermodal this year. As I alluded to before, there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts in that business with the alliances evolving, all the overcapacity and what I\u2019d call some in-fighting about which ports are the ultimate winners. We\u2019ve seen the West Coast ports kind of bounce back from the levels that they were at during the \u2013 immediately following the ILWU issues. But the Gulf ports and the East Coast ports are still kind of duking it out. It will be on balance hard to predict what happens in international intermodal I would say. Tom Wadewitz : So you think the net result is a little bit of growth in volume or is that hard to say? Beth Whited : Yes, I don\u2019t think I would be willing to make a bet on that today. Rob Knight : Right. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thank you Beth, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for fitting me in here. So Lance, I was curious if you could help us understand what drove the Board\u2019s decision to make a leadership change in the sales and marketing team? And perhaps as a follow-up, Beth, if \u2013 can you let us know how, if at all, we can expect UNP\u2019s approach to customers and pricing change, with you running the group there? Lance Fritz : Yes, Bascome, this is Lance. The Board supported my decision to change our leadership team around a bit. It was really prompted by one of our executives getting close to retirement, announcing their intention to retire. That allowed me to put Eric Butler into a job that he is exceptionally well suited for. That will benefit the Corporation. That allowed us to put Beth into the Chief Marketing Officer job and she\u2019s going to be tremendous in that role. So it had nothing to do with other than normal, customary and routine succession planning and it\u2019s an execution of our succession plan. And I couldn\u2019t be happier with it and the Board couldn\u2019t be happier with it as well. Beth Whited : As far as I\u2019m concerned, I think that Eric was a wonderful leader for the department. He set a lot of strategies in place that focused our entire organization on pricing and we will continue along that pricing path in the manner that Rob has laid out for you today. In terms of changes, of course we\u2019re always going to try to evolve and change with the marketplaces but we\u2019re going to keep our focus pretty simple. We\u2019re going to keep trying to grow volume on a network. We\u2019re going to try to retain the great customer base that we\u2019ve already got. And we\u2019re going to keep taking price in the marketplace as circumstances allow. Bascome Majors : Thank you both for the color there. Lance Fritz : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had one question on productivity, and just trying to understand whether productivity savings are an absolute reduction in the cost base, or an effort to maybe make the cost structure a little bit more variable, where you lower the decrementals, but also lower the incrementals. If you could just sort of help us understand that a little bit better, so we can get a sense of maybe how some of the productivity actions you have taken and are taking, can maybe impact conversion of revenue growth in the future? Thanks. Rob Knight : I\u2019ll start, and then if Cameron would like to add some Technicolor, he\u2019s welcome to. So Amit, when you think about the productivity that we have, Cameron and team and the rest of the executive leadership team have removed cost from our structure. It\u2019s come out in different ways. Our overhead, management and administrative burden has been reduced. I do not see a need to increase that as we grow into the future, so that\u2019s fundamentally changed how we drop revenue to bottom line to some extent. From an operating perspective, Cameron and team have done a tremendous job at reducing what we\u2019ve considered kind of structural wastes like re-crews. That\u2019s where a crew is required to take a train to destination other than the train that originate or the crew that originated with the train. That\u2019s pure waste. And the fact that we\u2019re now at record low levels and intend to stay there has kind of structurally reduced our cost base. There\u2019s hundreds of examples like that that tell us that, A, it\u2019s real productivity, real-time, right now; and B, we don\u2019t anticipate it growing back to the same levels it was historically. Now, clearly when our volume declined, there was some just pure volume reduction in costs because we didn\u2019t need as many, for instance, TE&Y or as many mechanical forces to support the business. And as we grow, we expect that to grow back but not one for one as we\u2019ve said before. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Rob Knight : Cameron, you got anything to add to that? Cameron Scott : Amit, I think one of my favorite productivity initiatives is train size. It might give you a sense that we have plenty of head room in productivity as Rob indicated. We\u2019ve set all-time train size records for four years in a row. And we\u2019re not close to optimizing our network. Coal is truly the only network that is very close to being optimized and we still have some room there. Rest of the network is wide open for opportunity, making sure we match up train size with taking good care of Beth\u2019s customer commitment. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for that. Can I just ask one follow-up on taxes? You mentioned it very briefly in the prepared remarks, but I know corporate tax reform is a really tough question to answer today. But if you can generally talk about \u2013 if the industry, or if we do receive any major relief on corporate taxes, how that would translate to the P&L? Do you think some of it could be competed away, either through wage inflation or lower prices? And then, also, Rob, I think the Company has over $15 billion deferred tax liability. So I would expect that to be reduced pretty significantly, if we do get any relief. Does that change at all, the Company\u2019s thinking on capital deployment strategy? Thanks. Rob Knight : Yes. This is Rob. Amit, as you obviously know, there\u2019s a lot of devils in the details if you will in terms of how and when and if that will all play out. I would just say you\u2019ve sized it right. And my expectation of any tax reduction benefit that may result would flow to the benefit of the Company. I mean, we\u2019re not sitting here thinking about making \u2013 holding back, making capital investment decisions based on the tax rate as an example. So I would anticipate that that wouldn\u2019t impact sort of how we treat that and I think it would be to the benefit of us and our shareholders if that played out and we would have the expectation of hanging onto it. Cameron Scott : Yes. Just a reminder, right. So job one is create more cash from operations, so job two, we have the opportunity to use it for CapEx for rewarding our shareholders either in the form of buyback or dividend. Amit Mehrotra : Right. I guess, you\u2019re already doing that to a pretty significant degree. So to the extent that you get a windfall or maybe an increase in the book capital as a results of a reduction of deferred tax liability. You would just basically do more of what you\u2019ve been doing, in terms of dividend, share buybacks, is that the correct read? Rob Knight : Let\u2019s answer that from the perspective of would we take a windfall and some how apply it to capital projects that are not funded and the answer is no. We fund the capital projects that we think are appropriate for the business, that\u2019s our first highest order for cash utilization and we\u2019re very satisfied with what we\u2019re spending in capital right now. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. All right. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks for taking the time. Congrats on the good quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, if I could ask one question with regards to the competitive dynamic on the pricing side. If you were to describe your key competitors, both BN and trucking, if you were to describe their behavior in the last, call it three or four quarters, and how that might have changed as we go into 2017, would you say \u2013 I just leave it over to you \u2013 how would you describe that competitive behavior over the last little while? Lance Fritz : Beth, you want to take that? Beth Whited : Sure. I guess what I would say is that we\u2019re always in competitive marketplaces where we have trucks or other railroads who are making decisions about what makes sense for their business and our focus really is on ensuring that we\u2019re getting reinvestable pricing that makes sense to us for our business. Now, from time to time markets change and you\u2019ll see pricing change and we have to make decisions about whether or not we should meet the market where it is and we do that thoughtfully with the idea that our ultimate goal is to make decisions that represent our customer value proposition and what we think the value that we provide in the marketplace is. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Let me \u2013 perhaps if I get a little bit more specific, I guess. You took some actions a couple years ago when BN was struggling in a capacity environment with crude. With the crude coming off, we\u2019ve been hearing that BN has reversed some of that with their own actions on a pricing standpoint. Is that true? And has there been any \u2013 if it is true, has there been any improvement in that dynamic in recent months? Lance Fritz : Walter, this is Lance. I\u2019ll take that. So if you go back to 2014, there were opportunities for us to haul business that typically we wouldn\u2019t see for a number of reasons and we definitely took advantage of those opportunities. That was not a price based decision. That was a market offering us opportunity that we typically don\u2019t enjoy. And we\u2019ve already talked about that and our value proposition allowed us to have some of that be sticky and stay with us and some of it did not. Looking at today\u2019s world, Beth\u2019s answer is exactly as it is. There\u2019s competitive dynamics in every commodity market that we serve. Those change over time. The environment clearly has been more difficult in 2016 than in previous years. And what will help that is if the markets themselves start improving, demand starts increasing, excess capacity gets consumed and then our pricing environment will improve. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate that color. Just on the second question here, and again I guess, this is for Beth, your franchise has enjoyed a nice lift in ag over the last 12 months. When you look out to 2017, are you forecasting growth on top of what should be a fairly difficult compare, or should we be building in, to be conservative, and to model an average crop year? Should we really be looking at a back half decline in your ag business in 2017? Beth Whited : I wouldn\u2019t say that we still believe that we have opportunities to grow in our ag business that as I mentioned before. And there\u2019s a lot of dynamic that\u2019s have to happen, but the grain carry-out is strong. We don\u2019t know what will happen with the crop yet. We have a lot of grain products, things like biodiesel and ethanol that are moving pretty solid for us and then we continue to have opportunity in our refrigerated business to grow. So I think you have to decide how you want to put that into your model. But in general, we feel pretty good about our ag business in 2017. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Thank you very much for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Cherilyn Radbourne : The call is running long, so I\u2019ll just ask one on CapEx. Your guidance implies that you\u2019re going to be down just over 10% year-over-year in 2017 versus 2016, and the step-down versus 2015 is obviously even much more substantial. I assume a lot of that is lower locomotive purchases, but can you just call out some of the other areas of major savings? Lance Fritz : Yes. Rob, you want to take that? Rob Knight : Yes. At a high level, Cherilyn \u2013 I mean, you\u2019re right, the big ticket items if you will, if you look at the timeframe that you\u2019re citing would be locomotive and positive train control. I mean, those are two sizable. Beyond that, we always look at kind of a clean sheet approach if you will in terms of capital investments that we\u2019re of confident will drive returns and remember that every year, year in, year out, we spend just north of $2 billion on replacement capital, so everything above that is driven based on commercial decisions and with an eye on returns and capacity expansion, et cetera. So but the big ticket items, I think in terms of the timeframe you\u2019re looking at would be locomotive and positive train control. Cherilyn Radbourne : And then, just very quickly, in terms of the freight cars that you\u2019re adding in 2017, is that across the board, or are there particular areas where you\u2019re renewing the fleet? Lance Fritz : Cherilyn, when we make freight car decisions, those are very granular and targeted. Every year we look at what we think the long range plan and the closer years in that long range plan mean in terms of overall fleet. We bounce that against what\u2019s retiring out and we make a judgment call as to what we need to purchase. So those \u2013 what gets purchased in any given year, the mix of freight cars that are being purchased and the quantities change and can change pretty dramatically. I would include that also incorporating containers and chassis. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That\u2019s all from me. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please go ahead with your questions. Jeff Kauffman : Okay, thank you very much. Can you guys hear me? Lance Fritz : Yes. Jeff Kauffman : Okay, thank you. Just a quick question for Rob. I know it\u2019s been a long call here. Rob, there was no discussion when you were talking about labor inflation, as to what was wage-related, what might be benefit and pension-related. And I know a number of other companies have flagged that pension goes from being more of a headwind to more of a tailwind, given what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. When you gave the labor inflation guidance, was that all-in? Rob Knight : Yes, it is. And just a comment on that; yes, I\u2019m not going to break it out but I would say that the health and welfare component of that is certainly one of the drivers. I mean, there are other drivers but that is a sizable piece of the expectation of overall labor inflation will go up in 2017. Jeff Kauffman : All right. Congratulations and thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions. Daniel Hultberg : Good morning. This is Daniel Hultberg, squeezing in for Scott here. Thank you for taking my question. Can you guys please elaborate a little bit on the end market outlook in the industrial products segment, and how we should think about the growth there, as we compare to the full year growth volume outlook for 2017? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Beth? Beth Whited : Yes. For our industrial products market, there\u2019s \u2013 as you know, it\u2019s kind of a market basket, has a bunch of different things in it. One of the biggest growth areas we\u2019ll see in 2017 will be frac sand and I mentioned earlier that we\u2019ve really seen rig counts come up and fortunately for us a lot of them are in the Permian Basin and we believe that\u2019s going to give us some opportunity to participate. But we do think that as we see the economy get some more legs and momentum, that we should have an in line opportunity to participate in that expansion in things like construction products and lumber specifically. Those are probably the key areas where we see growth. But I would say that we view that whole market basket as being pretty stable to growing in 2017. Daniel Hultberg : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your questions. Brian Konigsberg : Yes, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll just be very quick. The commentary just about the contract changes relates to auto, how do we think about that, if we have a kind of a base assumption for the market this year? Should we think that you\u2019re structurally below that because of the contract changes? Any color there would be helpful? Beth Whited : I would say the SAAR predicts pretty stable volumes for us into 2017, but as you suggest, we will lap that contract that we discussed in the early part of 2017 and so after that you should see us kind of participate in the market as it moves. Lance Fritz : Don\u2019t forget that embedded in automotive for us are automotive parts and we\u2019ve done a really sound job. Eric and Beth\u2019s team have done a really sound job of penetrating that market and growing it. So that\u2019s a moving part there too. Brian Konigsberg : Actually if I could sneak one last one in. I\u2019m sorry, were you adding onto that? Beth Whited : No, go ahead. Brian Konigsberg : I\u2019m sorry. Just last question on inflation, just coming back to that. So 3% is a bit higher than I think some of your peers had suggested for the year. I know, before you did say that health and welfare will be a leading driver of that. I think you said that last quarter. But are other components \u2013 maybe you could talk about some of the other components that are really picking up, that are contributing as well, because I didn\u2019t think that, in aggregate it would reach 3%. It was just kind of the outlier on health and welfare, where that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case now. Rob Knight : Yes. Brian, this is Rob. I would just say that overall our overall inflation, I didn\u2019t call out specially just labor, but labor will be a sizable piece of it, our expectation is 3%. And I would just say, that it will be what it will be. But I frankly not speaking for other railroads, but I think in terms of the labor and the health and welfare I would be surprised that if at the end of the day there\u2019s a difference between us. Brian Konigsberg : Got it. Thank you. Operator : This concludes question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with you all again in April. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

(Broker) Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific first quarter 2017 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. You may begin. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017. This equates to a first quarter record $1.32 per share which is up 14% over last year. Total volume increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2016, carload volume increased in three of our six commodity groups, led by a 16% increase in coal. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1% which is flat with the first quarter of 2016. This is a very solid start to the year, especially given the weather challenges we encountered on the Western part of our network earlier in the quarter. In keeping with our strategic value tracks, our engaged employees worked safely and productively under very difficult circumstances during the quarter. As a result, operations were restored quickly as we continued to focus on providing an excellent customer experience. Our team will give you more of the details on the quarter, starting with Beth... Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the first quarter, our volume was up 2% driven primarily by Coal, Agricultural Products and Industrial Products, offset by declines in Automotive and Chemicals. We generated positive net core pricing of 1% in the quarter, with continued energy related and Intermodal pricing pressure. The increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 6% increase in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each our six business groups. Ag Products revenue increased 7% on 6% volume growth and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads increased 19% year-over-year driven by ample U.S. grain supply and global market competitiveness increasing demand for grain exports, primarily wheat and corn. Grain product carloads were flat, with strengths from DDG exports to Mexico and soybean meal shipments in the U.S. offset by a drop in canola meal and oils volume. Food and refrigerated carloads were down 3% driven by declines in canned goods. Refrigerated markets were also down due to Western region weather challenges and ample truck availability. Looking at the remainder of the year, the strong South American crop and continued abundance of grain stocks will create uncertainty in the grain markets. Weather and crop health will also continue to be factors. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will see strength as the year progresses. Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter on a 2% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 8% as a result of previously referenced contract changes which we have now largely lapped and lower production levels. These changes were partially offset by increased West Coast imports and new production in Mexico. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.2 million vehicles in the first quarter, down 1% from first quarter 2016. On the parts side, over the road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 5% increase in volume. The U.S. light vehicle forecast for full year 2017 is 17.4 million units, down 1% from the 2016 record rate of 17.6 million. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to high inventory, dealer incentives and rising interest rates. On the parts side, however, over the road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth. Chemicals revenue was up 1% for the quarter on a 4% decrease in volume and 5% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 23% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down 87% to about 2,000 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume excluding crude oil was up 1% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in plastics which was up 3% in the quarter due to increased polypropylene shipments. For the rest of 2017 our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable, strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions beginning to come online as well as in industrial chemicals driven by improvement in industrial production. Both of these will continue to help offset the expected continued decline in crude oil shipments. Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 16% increase in volume and 8% improvement in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were up 21% and 5% respectively from higher natural gas prices and stronger West Coast exports which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and they are nearing the five-year average. Looking forward, we expect Coal volumes will continue to benefit from favorable 2016 comps in the second quarter. For the second half the year we expect sustained volume, assuming natural gas prices remain in the $3 range. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. Industrial Products revenue was up 9% on a 1% increase in volume and a 7% increase in average revenue per car during the car. Minerals volume increased 32% in the quarter, driven by a 59% increase in frac sand shipments, through increased shale related drilling activity, and profit intensity per drilling well. Construction products volume was down 9% due to projects completed in 2016 that did not continue into 2017, largely in South Texas. This market was also impacted by Western region weather challenges. Specialized markets were impacted by reduced project-based waste shipments partially offset by strength in our wind and government markets. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued strength in frac sand shipments as rig counts in our served territory continue to increase. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacts a number of Industrial Products markets, especially metals, and creates some uncertainty in our outlook. Intermodal revenue was up 3% with flat volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 1% in the quarter driven by a challenging competitive environment and abundant truck capacity. International volume was up 1% in the quarter from stronger westbound shipments, inventory restocking and volume pushes prior to the ocean carrier alliance changes effective April 1. Looking forward we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by ongoing ocean carrier financial stress, industry consolidation and potential trade policy changes. While trucking capacity is abundant currently making modal conversions challenging we expect a tightening of capacity late in the year with the implementation of electronic log books providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions. To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. Favorable coal comps will continue into the second quarter. We also anticipate strength in other key markets including continued growth in frac sand. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Beth. And good morning. Starting with safety performance our reportable personal injury rate increased to 0.89 versus the first quarter record of 0.75 achieved in 2016. While disappointed with the results, the team remains fully committed to successfully addressing risk in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate of 3.18 increased 11% versus the first quarter of last year. To make improvement going forward, we'll continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training to eliminate human factor incidents and making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents. In addition, we're collecting millions of data points on the health of our track condition and are actively developing advanced analytical models to better identify and mitigate this risk. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2016 to 2.21. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, our crossing assessment process or CAP couples our comprehensive safety culture with data analysis to help focus increased attention on the crossings where we can most substantially impact public safety. Moving on to network performance. Severe weather throughout much of our Western region caused multiple track outages and service interruptions during the first quarter. As a result, velocity declined 6% while terminal dwell increased 7% when compared to 2016. Despite the weather challenges, we were still able to generate efficiency gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased 4% during the first quarter. I would like to take a moment to thank the team for their hard work and dedication as they did an excellent job of restoring the network quickly and safely in an effort to minimize delays so we could continue delivering an excellent customer experience. Moving on to resources. Throughout the quarter as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to account for volume changes, weather disruptions and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y work force was down 1% in the first quarter when compared to the same period in 2016. And our engineering and mechanical work force was down a combined 1100 employees or 5%. At the end of the quarter we had approximately 1650 TE&Y furloughs. We do expect those numbers to decline throughout the year as we look to the furlough pool first to backfill attrition. The active locomotive fleet was up 3% for the first quarter of 2017, primarily to help minimize the impact of weather related challenges and we had approximately 1400 locomotives in storage at the end of the first quarter. As always, we will continue to adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to efficiently right-sizing our resource base, we continued realizing gains in other key productivity initiatives such as train size. Our persistent focus on productivity once again resulted in train size performance improvement as we achieved best ever quarterly results in our Automotive and manifest networks and first quarter records in our Intermodal and grain networks. To wrap up, despite some first quarter challenges, we expect to build positive momentum as we focus on critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety where we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to incident-free environment. And our balanced resource base puts us in tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line as we maintain our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $3.3 billion, up 6% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increased operating expense in the quarter. Operating income totaled almost $1.8 billion, a 6% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $67 million, up from $46 million in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a real estate pre-tax gain totaling $26 million or approximately $0.02 per share. Interest expense of $172 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense increased about 5% to $616 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1.1 billion, up 9% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce a record first quarter earnings per share of $1.32 per share. And as we discussed back in March, we encountered severe weather on the Western part of our network which negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.03 in the quarter. A good portion of this was lost revenue. The operating ratio was flat with the first quarter last year even with the fuel headwind we faced during the quarter. Higher fuel prices negatively impacted the operating ratio by about 1.3 points. Now turning to the top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was up over 6% versus last year, driven by a 2% increase in volume along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $212 million, up $99 million when compared to 2016 and up about $25 million from the fourth quarter of last year. All in, we estimate the net impact of higher fuel prices was a $0.02 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the first quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings along with a reduction in shorter haul rock volumes. Core price was about 1%. Pricing in our energy and Intermodal business continues to be under pressure given the competitiveness in those respective markets. We expect these challenges to continue throughout the first part of 2017 before beginning to strengthen later in the year, assuming market conditions improve. Excluding Coal and Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. And for the full year, we are on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our inflation costs. Our strategy of pricing our service product based on the value proposition it represents in the competitive marketplace at levels that generate a reinvestable return remains intact. Turning now to the operating expense. Slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation, higher volume, and weather-related costs. Labor inflation was about 5% in the quarter. Partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital work force resulting in total work force levels declining 4% in the quarter versus last year or about 1,600 employees less. For the remainder of 2017, we do expect force levels to adjust with volume but will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives. Fuel expense totaled $460 million, up 44% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 7% increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 4% while our average fuel price increased 40% to $1.75 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 1% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower joint facility expenses and locomotive material costs. Turning to slide 21. Depreciation expense was $520 million, up 4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by a higher depreciable base. For the full year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $276 million which is down 4% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive lease expense and a mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction. Other expenses came in at $260 million, up 4% versus last year. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items. Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first quarter totaled about $1.9 billion, down $290 million when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $17.8 billion at quarter end. This does not include the $1 billion of new debt which closed just after the quarter end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, and this keeps us close to our target ratio of just under two times. Dividend payments for the quarter totaled nearly $500 million, compared to $465 million last year. This includes a 10% dividend increase per share which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to dividends, we also bought back over 7.5 million shares totaling $800 million, an increase of around 12% over last year. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased nearly 30% of our outstanding shares. And between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, which represented just over 120% of first quarter net income. On the productivity side, our G55+0 initiatives yielded around $90 million of productivity in the quarter. A couple of examples of our productivity include effectively leveraging volume growth that we achieved in the quarter, reducing locomotive servicing and repair costs, turning back leased equipment no longer required, and furthering our efforts to be more efficient on our support functions. With these results, we continue to progress as expected and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million productivity goal for the full year. Looking forward, we still expect full year volume growth to be up in the low single digit range. Second quarter volumes could be a little stronger driven primarily by the benefit of an easier comparison year-over-year. With positive volume, positive core price, and significant productivity benefits, we are still on track to have an improved full year operating ratio. Longer term, we are still focused on achieving our targeted 60% operating ratio, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019 and we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continued the momentum of our volume, pricing and productivity initiatives. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Rob. With a solid first quarter performance behind us, we'll continue to press ahead with our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives through the remainder of year. As Beth mentioned, we're seeing particular strength in a few markets such as frac sand. Coal seems to have stabilized and we're seeing some signs of gradual improvement in other areas of the economy. Our six-track value strategy will keep us intensely focused on effectively leveraging volume growth while providing our customers an excellent experience and our shareholders a solid return on their investment. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question today comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Diane Huang on for Ravi. Thank you for taking my question. So, a question here is the average number of employees was down about 4% year-over-year despite volumes growing 2%. So, with your full-year volume outlook of up low-single digits for the year, do you expect to hold the first quarter head count level flat sequentially for the rest of the year? And then a second part to that question is in the past you guys talked about 50% incremental margins. So, with your G55 initiative and also positive volume growth, we can see higher levels of incremental margins for the rest of the year. Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Diane. We'll let Rob answer those questions. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, on the head count question, yeah, you're exactly right in what you pointed out in terms of the great productivity that we saw in the first quarter in the face of some of the challenges that we talked about. Full year, I mean, I'll just call you back to our guidance we've given, and that is head count will move with volume, but we obviously will achieve productivity along the way, so it won't be one-for-one, So, we stay away from giving a precise number, but rest assured, to achieve our objectives we're going to continue to drive productivity and it will be reflected in those numbers. In terms of the incremental margin, as we look out to achieve both our 60% OR guidance by 2019 and then, beyond that, our 55%, it's going to require incremental margins in the 50% to 60% range, and that's kind of how we think about it and that's what we're focused on. Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, that's very helpful. And then a quick one here. Can you quantify how much of the $0.03 to $0.04 EPS headwind from weather was related to revenues versus expense? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: We didn't break that out, but I would just say a large portion of the $0.03 showed up on the revenue line. Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the pricing pressure you mentioned and the competitive environment in Intermodal. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit and talk about how the current level of competition compares to what you've seen historically and maybe how that's progressed throughout the quarter and into April and your expectations on that front? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: We are seeing ample truck capacity in the market as well as pretty significant pricing pressure in the Intermodal space. It has not abated as we've gone into April. As we think about the rest of the year, we certainly are expecting to see capacity tighten as electronic logbooks come into play, and so our expectation would be that you would start to see some rationalization of capacity and an opportunity for better pricing. Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, appreciate that. And then maybe just on frac sand, can you just talk a little bit more about the fundamentals there? It looks like you're seeing some acceleration in 2Q. I guess where are you relative to the prior peak in that business and has there been any significant change in the mix of business? And I guess if you're able to quantify the positive mix impact that you mentioned earlier? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Okay. So, we are seeing substantial increases in demand in Texas, specifically in the Permian Basin. We'd mentioned that we were up 59% in the quarter. We were up almost 100% in the Permian Basin and we're up around 40% in Eagle Ford. We're seeing some spiking demand as well in the Niobrara, but not as substantial. I would say that that is sustaining and maybe even growing a little bit as we enter into the second quarter. And I don't see anything right now that changes that, so that's been a bright spot for us. You asked a question about mix. We are starting to see some local brown sand come into play, especially in the Permian. So, we're looking at something like 85% white sand, 15% brown sand. We expect the pie to continue to grow and it's possible over time brown sand will take up a larger piece of the pie, but still opportunity for us and we're participating in that market as much as we can. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Hey, Eric, just stepping back a couple of kind of high-level things that are going on in that shale energy market. One is many of these shale energy exploration plays are competitive at $50 oil and so it looks like it's potentially a sustained marketplace. And the second thing is the sand intensity per well has been increasing and that also looks like it's a favorable trend. Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. So, I wanted to \u2013 I guess first I'll just ask about Coal. I think, Lance, you mentioned stabilization in Coal. I know there are a lot of factors that affect the business, and probably natural gas price is one of the most important. But how do you see the lay of the land maybe over the next year in terms of impact from facility closures, impact potentially from renewables capacity coming on. Do you think that from that perspective that you would have some stability and you're really kind of weather dependent? Or are there some other faculties like that, new capacity or shutdowns, that we should consider over the next year? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: We do view that as being pretty stable over the next year. You called out exactly the right factors that will impact it. Weather clearly will remain a factor and natural gas prices are really very key to keeping coal-generated electricity on the dispatch curve. So, with those couple of things in mind, we view it as being pretty stable over the horizon here. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And one on the operating side. How would you characterize -- I mean, seems like your growth is coming in, aside from the Coal growth, you're getting a lot of growth in what might be in the manifest network, not so much in Intermodal, so I think you get good operating leverage and seems like you're doing a good job of expanding train length. How much capacity do you have to run longer trains in the manifest network? I know it's train by train, segment by segment, but overall, have you got another 10% you could add to train length in manifest or what's the right ballpark for that? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Tom, I won't give you an exact figure, but there is plenty of headroom inside our network, almost across the board between our three regions for more train size opportunities and we will, on a case by case, lane by lane basis, take advantage of that. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So that leverage should continue in the near term? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes, sir, it should. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great, thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks, everybody. Congrats on a good quarter. Just following up on the incremental question, the first question. I wanted to just ask the underlying \u2013 trying to understand what the underlying incrementals were in the quarter after adjusting for the weather impact. I don't have perfect information from the data you provided but it looks like it was in the mid 50% level and then if you can just confirm that or correct me if I'm wrong? And then if you look at the OR targets over the long-term, obviously this is an enormously capital intensive business. What I'm trying to understand as you look at bridging where you are today to where you want to be, how much of that trajectory is I guess fully kind of in your control via net cost savings and how much of it is volume growth that's kind of out of your control? I would imagine the vast majority of it would be volume growth, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Rob, you want to handle that. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. In the first quarter, our incremental margins as reported were about 35%. And if you adjust for the fuel, they were closer to like 65%. I didn't break out the impact of weather, but obviously that had a slight impact on that calculus. But those are the numbers as reported. And as I said earlier, to drive to our stated goals we need to be in the 50% to 60% range on an annualized basis to get from here to there and that's how we're focused. In terms of what will drive the incremental margins, what will drive the leverage, I would just say \u2013 you said volume's out of our control, somewhat that's true because we have to play the hand the economy deals us. But we also, as part of our G55+0 initiatives, are focused on developing business development opportunities where we can have some control over volume and obviously providing quality safe service to our customers is one of the key drivers to in fact encouraging volume growth on our railroad. So we view a lot of that as in our control and we're focused on driving quality volume, continuing to focus on providing quality service so we can price it right above inflation and continue our focus on productivity initiatives which we have been successfully delivering. You add all that up, that's what's going to get us from where we are to the 60% and ultimately to the 55%. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Amit, I thought I heard you ask a question on CapEx and as we look forward on CapEx that's driven, you mentioned growth that's driven part by about a $2 billion spend to maintain a robust network and then the rest is about finding investments that have a reasonable and attractive return. Positive train control of course is in its last couple of years of significant investment. So that will start trailing off and we'll see what the future brings. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks and if I could just follow up one question on pricing. Rob, you've kind of talked over the last couple quarters ad nauseam about core pricing dynamics and how you guys calculate it. If you can just update us, some of the energy volumes are coming back online now and just if you could provide some color if the pricing pressure or the decelerating pricing environment has abated at all as some of those volumes have come back online and also the positive spread between price increases and cost inflation that you've talked about. Has that spread changed at all since the start of the year in a more positive direction in some of the export volumes of Coal and the energy volumes are a little bit better than expected? Thanks. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I would just say you're right. We have attempted to explain how we calculate price and again I'm proud to announce, as you all have heard me say for many years, that we are very conservative in terms of how we accurately capture what we report on price. But nothing's changed from the guidance we gave. And that is that we're focused on driving dollars that we yield from our pricing initiatives higher than for the full year, higher than the dollars we expend on inflation and coming into this year we called out that that gap this year was clearly going to be tighter than last year, largely driven by some of the pressures that you're asking about in our energy and Intermodal businesses on the one hand and on the other hand a higher inflation rate, which for the full year we still see overall inflation in that 3% range which is obviously is higher than what we ended up with last year. So nothing has changed but I would just point out that, as Beth commented in her remarks, we are continuing to face competitive pressures in the energy and Intermodal businesses, so that has not abated. That continues. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. That's very clear. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question's coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up there. So, if I look at the segments, Coal had the best yield growth of any of the segments, and I'm wondering is that a mix benefit or change or maybe do some of the contracts have something tied to higher natural gas prices? And if not, does the rising natural gas environment \u2013 we understand how it helps volumes but how do you think that impacts Coal pricing? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Rob, let's start with you and then we can have Beth... Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Beth can talk about the pricing, but I would just say from a yield and depending on how you're calculating the yield, Scott, I would just say that a large part of what we saw in terms of the overall yields and we don't break it out by commodity group as you may like us to as finitely. But I would just say that the mix impact of the significant volume growth year-over-year in Coal really did impact the reported mix numbers on the yield that you're I think referring to. In terms of the pricing dynamics, Beth. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, the pricing dynamics remain, as Rob just said, it's really quite competitive but the length of haul helped us both coming out of the PRB and going into Texas as well as the export volumes which did grow a bit for us in the first quarter. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay and then just maybe a bigger picture question, Lance. Relative to a quarter ago the big change in the industry is that you've got Hunter now at CSX and given what he does and the way he talks, I'm wondering does that in any way change the way that you guys think about the longer term margin opportunity? Does it have any impact on the way you think about the business or manage the business or the pace in which you want to improve margins? Any kind of change in your thinking relative to a quarter ago? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: So, Scott, let's start by saying we have great respect for CSX, the management team there, their business. They run a good business. They've got a great business model, and I'm sure Hunter is bringing significant change to that business model and he's got a great track record in our industry. Setting that aside, we run our business with an eye towards being as efficient as we possibly can be and driving our six value tracks. Now we keep our eyes open, and we learn from anybody we can outside of our business, and we've done that historically, and we'll continue to do that. A great case in point is the 600-some-odd low horsepower locomotives we've taken out of our network over the past couple of years. That was a lesson we learned from a couple of other entities, and we figured out how to apply it to ourselves, and we've done that effectively. So our focus is get to that 60%, plus minus, by 2019 and then get to 55%. And we'll get there as quickly as we can, keeping in mind we've got a number of levers that we're moving in terms of growth on the top line, productivity and trying to drive core price. And again if somebody's got a great idea that looks like it can apply to our business model, we're going to use it, but it's not going to fundamentally change how we run our business or approach our strategy. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you for the thoughts, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, guys. So just wanted to start on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're getting closer to your level that you've set in terms of the target rate of two times debt to EBITDA but it seems like you're still able to access some very low cost debt. Has there been any internal discussion in terms of raising that cap and maybe increasing returns to shareholders? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Rob, you want to take a stab at that. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: We're comfortable with the guidance we've given of that two times, but rest assured we're very focused on driving cash flow and that with higher cash flow we'll support higher levels of debt and that then supports higher levels of continued share repurchases. That's our focus. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So it sounds like, no, that two times cap is a pretty hard cap at the moment? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: We feel good with that as we look forward. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. And then just turning quickly to crude by rail. The volumes are obviously down pretty dramatically this quarter. Is that an area that's just not a viable area going forward for Union Pacific? You go back a couple of years ago, and everybody thought this was going to be a growth area for the rails. It seems like pipeline has pretty much displaced that. Is there an opportunity that that growth could ever return? Just would love to hear your thoughts on that. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So Union Pacific really doesn't have a crude oil franchise like some of the other railroads. So we will continue, I think, to be spot players as opportunities open up for arbitrage. So you might see a little move to California out of Canada. You might see a little bit move to the Gulf. But in terms of our core franchise lanes, I don't think that it's a big market for Union Pacific going forward. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, fair enough. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.: Thank you very much. Lot of focus on revenues and end markets. I wanted to come back to capital investment and just get an idea on an updated basis where the CapEx guidance is, I'm assuming unchanged. And talk a little bit about what opportunities there may be going forward to take some of that capital investment down where need be. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I'll take a stab at that and then we'll let either Rob or Cam add some technicolor. So our $3.1 billion for the year remains $3.1 billion. Of course, there are moving parts in there, but that's what we're expecting for our full year. As we look forward, the moving parts again are about $2 billion of replacement capital annually. We don't see much that changes that dramatically over time in order to maintain a really robust network. Positive train control is coming towards the end of its significant capital spend as we finally implement in its entirety of the project by 2018 and then work through 2020 to get the bugs kicked out and get it operating properly. After that, it's all about growth and safety and productivity targeted investments. Rob's also talked about a ballpark of 15% of revenue, and I don't think there's much that we see that takes us off those numbers. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I would just reiterate that, Jeff, that that 15% is probably the best. Again, that's not how we build our capital plan. That's the best way to kind of think about how we're thinking about it. But I would also just to Lance's comments that we are pleased with the disciplined approach we've brought to the capital planning process. And, in fact, our $3.1 billion is down about $1.2 billion on an annualized basis from the last couple of years. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.: Looking at the 1,400 parked locomotives or locomotives in storage, I guess, I should think about, they're not all brand new locomotives. Some of them are older locomotives. How much can you grow volume without having to make any kind of incremental investment in locomotive fleet? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: So, I'll let Cam add some, but bottom line is when you think about those 1400 parked locomotives, those are all the tail end of the fleet from the standpoint of we want to operate the most efficient, most reliable units, so those are generally going to be our newer units. You know, with that in mind, they're all serviceable and we did bring a fair number of them back, call it 400, at some point during the first quarter to overcome the impacts of those weather issues that we had on the West Coast. So, we've got plenty of headroom for growth prior to really needing to acquire new locomotives. Cameron? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: And, Lance, we've had a lot of practice over the past several years in bringing that locomotive fleet back to life. It's reliable. Doesn't require a lot of further investment and we've got a lot of headroom to bring on additional business without even thinking about new purchases. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I'll remind you we do have an obligation that's part of a long-term contract that includes purchases this year but absent the fact that we had a long-term contract, we would not be in the market. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: If I can, Lance, just to remind everybody what those numbers are that we've said. There's approximately 60 new ones this year and then 40 in 2018 and that completes that long-term commitment. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.: All right. Well, congratulations on a strong quarter and thanks, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on mix a little bit and, Rob, I think I ask this question a lot and I'm not sure if you're ever able to answer it, but wanted to get a sense when you think about sort of the mix of the business in the outlook that looks solid, things like frac sand, I think Coal's got a decent outlook for the rest of the year. When we think about that, just sort of directionally speaking, we should be expecting some of the positive mix tailwinds that you've had over the last couple quarters to persist. Is that fair way to look at it or is it a little bit too difficult to get into the weeds there? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Chris, you could probably write down my answer. That well could play out that way. I mean, you're right, we had a positive mix this quarter of 1%, as you're pointing out, largely driven by growth in Coal and sand. But we stay away from giving guidance on the mix because there's a lot of moving parts. And because we have such a diverse book of business, there's mix within mix in our varied business. But you're not thinking about it wrong. I mean, if those are the commodities that continue to strengthen relative to the rest of the base throughout the year, then that's not crazy thinking. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just wanted to come back to sort of the competitive dynamic in the Western U.S. between rail carriers. We've heard some anecdotal stuff about your competitor in terms of service degradation, mostly on the Intermodal side, but just a little bit around the margin there. I know you guys compete very aggressively everyday against BN, but just wanted to get a sense of maybe how that dynamic, even if it has changed at all as we go forward here. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: I don't feel like anything about the competitive dynamic has significantly altered. We're competing every day with our direct competitor as well as all the other modes of transportation that are capable of handling the same sort of freight that we have. It feels a little more intense on the Intermodal side in the first quarter, perhaps, than what we had seen, but it's an ongoing competitive situation that we are engaged in playing. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time this morning, guys, appreciate it. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, thank you. You just talked a little bit more about the competitive Intermodal environment with respect to pricing on the International side. I'm curious, are you looking for up-pricing on the domestic side with your partners there this year? And how does that compare to the 2% to 3% range, ex Coal, ex International that you threw out earlier? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Like we said before, if other things are up 2% to 3% then you're obviously having some pressure in other places to get to the 1% overall. So, we are very focused on what's going to happen with capacity as you move towards the end of the year and the electronic log books come into place, because we do think you'll see some rationalization at that time, providing an opportunity for pricing to improve in that truckload space. But that's not the only thing that we're focused on. We want to make sure that we have a great product that's very competitive, so that as more freight wants to move away from the highway and onto rail, we're standing there ready to deliver it to our customers in the manner that they expect. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And to follow up on that latter comment, specifically with your domestic partners, how do you balance your desire to improve your pricing and returns while still leaving them enough margin to continue to invest in growing in their business and grow their volumes on your lines? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: I would say certainly there's no percentage in it for us if we don't all win together. So, our goal is certainly to have a viable competitive product that enables all the people who are part of that supply chain to participate in a manner that makes sense to them from a business perspective. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. Thank you for the time. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, operator, and good morning, all. Wanted to stick on the Intermodal pricing a bit. How should we expect it to start improving if, in fact, ELDs do, like most of us think, tighten up truck capacity? Is that pricing going to be a little bit of a lag? So, should we expect like a 2018 improvement and not an improvement in 2017 in price? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: No, the ELDs come into play in late 2017. The requirement gets hardened. I think you just have to see, depending on bid cycles and other things, where you start to see the impact of that. Hard to predict. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And I wanted to jump back to something on the cost side. Rob, you mentioned labor inflation, I think, was about 5% in the quarter. Is that something that we should think about going forward about that number 5% for labor inflation? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I think it's a reasonable number to assume, Jason, both the 5% on labor and overall enterprise right around 3% for the full year. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right. And so, head count, obviously will depend upon what's happening with the volume side. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: That's right. That's right. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, fantastic. I appreciate the time, as always, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Lance, I wanted to ask you a question about some of the incentives that you guys maybe have put in place or are talking about putting in place through the board around the drive towards a 55% OR. One of the pushbacks we get in sort of recommending your stock is that there's a perception out there maybe management is a little bit taking their time on the margin side. There isn't as much of a sense of urgency. I'm just wondering if you guys have had any discussions about trying to address that through some specific initiatives tied towards margin goals or margin achievement. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Sure. I assure you management is not taking its time on trying to improve our margins. If you look at our long-term incentive plan, our proxy lines out the fact that it's built around an improved ROIC, or encouraging us to improve our return on invested capital. And in that there's a kicker that's designed around improving our operating margin. But all of our incentives essentially line us up, whether it's our long-term incentive plan or the fact that we're all significant shareholders or our short-term incentive plan, they're essentially all lined up for us to improve our operating margin and our return on invested capital as quickly as we can. The payouts get better and grow the faster and better we make those improvements. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: And, David, I have to just jump in here. This is Rob. We're actually \u2013 while we have every incentive, as Lance just commented on, and proud of the fact that everybody in our organization has 55% sort of on their mind, we're driving towards that. We are also proud, as the largest U.S. railroad to have the lowest operating ratio of the U.S. rails. That is something that we've worked hard at and are very proud of and we're going to continue that line of thinking to drive us to the 55%. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, and I just wanted to be clear that this is just a perception that I think some investors have in terms of maybe the radical change that's happening in the East and some of the targets that have been put out there, even for like Norfolk management around margin attainment. I was just wondering if you guys were going to be thinking about making that more front and center as far as trying to give the market a little bit of confidence that you guys are really pushing this target toward 55% and it's not just a target that's out there that you're going to drift towards, which is... Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: A couple of other reminders, right? We generated over $400 million in productivity last year. We talked about generating over $350 million in productivity this year. We are not just wandering around in the woods. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I appreciate that and thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, thanks for fitting me in here. Could you remind us what percentage of your book of business is under multiyear contract? And with pricing flat versus Q4, first, do you think we're at a bottom here? And then second, could full-year core price be up versus 2016 on the increase in these inflation escalators alone? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Beth, can you handle those questions on multiyear and what expect out of pricing? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, so we have about 40% of the business that's in longer term deals with escalators of one sort or another on them. We also do expect to see, based on market conditions that we've been talking about this morning, some improvement as we get towards the end of the year. Obviously, volume helps us, improvements in our customers' ability to get price in their markets, an improving economy helps us and volume can be our friend as well. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And just a quick one on frac sand. We've obviously seen some announcements from some of your customers for new facilities or expansions, so, with the significant increase that you've seen in the first quarter and thinking over the next few quarters, do you think that at some point during 2017, from a volume standpoint, that you could get back to a peak run rate that you saw back in 2014? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: I don't see us coming back to that sort of a peak in 2017. No. We do see good investments happening and we feel positive about what's happening in those markets, but I don't think we'll get back to peak levels soon. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. James Allen - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys, it's James Allen on for Brian. A question, my first question is on protectionism. We noticed the softwood lumber penalties that the U.S. is imposing on Canada and the Canadians have responded proposing a ban on U.S. thermal coal going into Canada, so, I guess we wondered if you had, first off, any direct exposure to the thermal coal? And then just what your view was on protectionism more broadly, if you thought there were any major risks or opportunities for your book of business as freight flows might change? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I'll take the freight, the trade question and it's broader and you can talk about coal, Beth. So, in terms of trade overall, our perspective is the following : that the U.S. economy is tightly connected to our trading partners. We understand that open global trade and more markets available to U.S. manufacturers and producers is critical both for jobs in the United States as well as for the economic vibrancy of the United States. We believe that that's well understood also in our current administration and we believe that while there are opportunities to both enforce existing trade agreements, enhance them and negotiate new ones, that the long-term answer is more markets available to U.S. manufacturers and producers is better than fewer markets available. That's essentially the pathway towards economic prosperity and job creation. So, with that, I'll let Beth answer the thermal coal question. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: So, we do not access the export facility in Vancouver that's being referenced in the most recent discussions about access. The coal that we export off the West Coast is hitting locations in California. James Allen - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then a quick follow-up question would be on the STB. There's a slightly changing composition with a new chairperson and new board seats, so just wondering in your interactions with the STB, has there been any new flavor to your discussions? Or any changes that you'd expect as they progress with existing regulatory initiatives? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Following the reauthorization in I think it was late 2015, the STB got very active at clearing a docket of a number of different items that were in front of them. We've seen that activity slow down a touch, which makes sense given that the current administration has the opportunity to appoint board members of that organization. What we're encouraging the STB as they're thinking about their docket of work is to not simply just look at each individual item as a stand-alone item, but also bear in mind that they all work together as a quilt of overriding regulation on the industry, and to think about the kind of interactivity of all the regulation they are contemplating. We look at the STB historically and think the balance they've struck has been good for the industry, and mostly important is good for the customers, letting the market work where the market will work and in those unique circumstances that require it imposing regulations. So, we keep encouraging them to be a deft hand when they're looking at their docket. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Unknown Speaker : Good morning, this is [indiscernible (59:38) on for Walter Spracklin. Just want to come back to the competitiveness there in the market. Your growth in grain volumes has remained strong. Is this a factor of the bumper grain crop moving and the export grain you mentioned? Or are there other share factors that might be helping to maintain that growth rate? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I wouldn't call that a share play. We saw really strong demand for wheat, stronger than we've seen in a while, for export largely to Mexico, as well as good corn movements in the world markets. So, not a share issue, I wouldn't say. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching to your OR here. How should we be thinking about the cadence towards an OR improvement over the year? Are there going to be more impactful initiatives that could land in one quarter? Or do you expect it to be a more even pace over the year? Thank you. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, this is Rob. We don't give guidance by quarter on operating ratio but, as a reminder, we are giving guidance that we expect to improve our operating ratio for the full year. But it never is a straight line. Volumes will dictate largely exactly what that cadence ends up being, but we're very focused on continuing to drive productivity. We talked about the pricing, a component of this being challenged in the first part of the year and hopefully improving later in the year. So, I wouldn't give you any indication that it would be a straight line. It could be lumpy, but the focus is the full year number. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: This quarter is a great example, Rob, where, what'd we have, 1.3 percentage points impact by fuel lag. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, good point. Fuel can always be a factor in that. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. So, just to follow up on Intermodal, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but from a directional standpoint do you think domestic Intermodal pricing will still be up this year? And you mentioned competitive pricing pressure in Intermodal, and really what I just want to get a sense for here is I want to understand how much of that is related to domestic Intermodal versus international Intermodal? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: The domestic and international Intermodal are both under pricing pressure. I would say we saw perhaps an acceleration of the pricing pressure in the domestic Intermodal space in the first quarter. Again, depending on what happens in those markets and what happens as we see the tightening capacity that we expect with electronic log books will really be the things that will determine what ends up happening overall with your pricing for the year. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful, but do you still think there's a possibility for your domestic Intermodal pricing to be up in 2017? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Justin, we don't guide on price specific to commodities. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, secondly, I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the assumption you're making for Coal volumes within the full year guidance. What are you assuming for growth in Coal volumes in the second quarter? And just to clarify some of the earlier commentary, were you suggesting that Coal volumes in the back half of the year are likely to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Justin, this is Rob. Let me take a stab at that. And, as you know, we don't give specific precise guidance by commodity for the year, but I would just \u2013 as it relates to Coal. I would just remind you of some of the comments that Beth made earlier, and that is it feels stable to us. The things to watch in Coal, as always, will largely be what's happening with gas prices and what's happening with weather. That will dictate from quarter to quarter what's actually happening with volume. The other thing we did point out is that we do have an easier comp as we head into the second quarter as it relates to our overall volumes, including Coal, and if you look at our last year numbers, that kind of flips later in the year, the third quarter gets a little more challenging. So, I think I would expect, all things being constant, that you'll see some changes from quarter-to-quarter as it relates to year-over-year volume growth in the Coal line. Again, comps are easier in the second quarter and get challenged in the third quarter, and it feels like a stable environment for us. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great, I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Justin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Zax Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, this is actually Zax Rosenberg on for Ben. Thanks for taking the question so late here. Just wanted to \u2013 a couple for me. Just wanted to follow up first on the trade questions from before and see if you have any specific thoughts on the proposed lumber tariff from earlier this week and how that potentially impacts your guys business specifically. And then secondly, flipping back over to Intermodal, there was a comment earlier about a volume push ahead of the some of the ocean freight, the carrier lines changes, and just wondering the expected impact of those alliance shifts and maybe possible diversion of ships to Canadian ports or what your thoughts are generally there? Thank you. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Okay on the softwood lumber, we really feel like those tariffs were priced in, where you saw a very significant run-up in the lumber prices in the first quarter. So, that doesn't feel like that's going to be impactful in terms of volume to us. And then, on the Intermodal side in terms of the alliances, that is still shaking itself out in terms of port usage and who's calling where and what size of ship and those sorts of things. Right now, it seems to be going pretty well. We're not seeing any significant disruptions. Feels like the process is playing out well. As you know, there is more capacity coming online in Canada later in the year. I would expect that a large amount of that could be utilized for Canadian shipping needs. So, we're not really expecting to see significant shifts at this point, but we'll have to see how it plays out and it will be wedded with the alliances. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Hey, Zax, going back to your softwood lumber question, what's really critical to us is getting housing starts and construction up. We have a wonderful franchise that kind of regardless of where the wood's coming from, we just need it to be consumed. Zax Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has been covered already. Just curious on the performance on RTMs versus carloads. Obviously, very good performance in RTMs, and also the relative difference in the carloads, presumably like the haul. Just curious should we expect that there's going to be that type of divergence for the remainder of the year or might those kind of come together as we progress through the year? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Brian, this is Rob. That measure, and I kind of made this reference earlier in the Q&A, that RTM impact that you're referring to was largely driven in the first quarter by the upswing in the Coal volumes, and we're not going to give guidance in terms of how that's going to play out for the year because what will drive that is what's the mix of the volume that we, in fact, see come across the book. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right, okay. And actually, this is more of a kind of theoretical-type question. I'm not sure how many specifics you can provide, but just given the discussion around tax and proposals on rates and previously there was discussion on the treatment of deduction on debt interest in the P&L. So, I don't know if you ran these scenarios through and have some thoughts around if they do not allow or they disallow interest tax deductions, might that change the capital allocation policies that you currently have in place? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Rob, you want to take that? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. There's a lot of devil in the details on the tax proposals. We, like everyone, are staying in tuned and watching what happens on that. But, so, yeah, there could be some impact. I wouldn't envision that, depending on how the interest plays out, I wouldn't envision that would change our capital spending or our debt guidance that we've given. I wouldn't envision that that will be the result of any changes as it relates to the interest. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Okay, thank you, Rob, and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with all of you again in July. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP Operator : Greetings and welcome to Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you. And good morning everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2017. This equates to a second quarter record $1.45 per share, which is up 24% over last year. Total volume increased 5% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume increased in four of our six commodity groups, led by a 17% increase in Coal and a 15% increase in Industrial Products. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.8%, which was a record for the second quarter and is a 3.4 percentage point improvement over the second quarter of 2016. In addition to the increase in volume, positive core pricing, and solid productivity were key drivers of the margin improvement. Guided by our strategic value tracks, our entire team is focused on providing an excellent customer experience while safely and efficiently delivering on our innovative productivity initiatives. I'm pleased with our results through the first six months and look forward to continuing our momentum through the remainder of the year. Our team is going to give you more of the details on the second quarter, starting with Beth. Beth Whited : Thank you, Lance and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was up 5%, driven primarily by Coal and Industrial Products with offsets in Automotive and Chemicals. We generated positive net core pricing of 1.5% in the quarter with continued energy related and intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition. The increase in volume and a 6% improvement in average revenue per car drove an 11% increase in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our six business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 7% on both the 3% volume and average revenue per car increase. Grain carloads increased 11% with continued strength in wheat exports, driven primarily by shipments to the Gulf and Mexico. Domestic corn volumes were up 5% from increased Midwest processor business and strength in the Mid-South poultry market. Grain products carloads were down 3%, primarily due to a reduction of soybean oil shipments resulting from soft biodiesel production. Partially offsetting lower volumes were higher ethanol shipments, driven by strong export demand to Brazil and China. Food and Refrigerated volumes were up 3%, driven by continued strength in sugar shipments as well as support from a healthy summer demand associated with the brewers and beverage market. Looking at the rest of the year, high global production of both seed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will create headwinds in our export markets. As always, we're keeping a close eye on the weather to see what the domestic corn and soybean crop will yield. We expect Food and Refrigerated shipments to grow from our cold connect service, sustained strength in sugar, and import beer trending with consumer demand. Automotive revenue was up 5% in the quarter on a 1% increase in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 4%, primarily as a result of softer vehicle sales leading to reduced production and shifting product mix. These changes were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and Mexico production growth. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the second quarter, down 3% from second quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 2% increase in volume. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17.1 million units, down 2% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5 million. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trend, higher inventory, and rising interest rates. The reduced SAR will impact both the finished vehicles and parts with a potential upset in over-the-road conversion opportunities. Chemicals revenue was up 4% for the quarter on a 2% decrease on volume and 6% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 20% as we continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down 84% to about 2,200 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemical volumes, excluding crude oil was up 2% in the quarter. Plastics carloads were up 6% due to low commodity prices, which drove increased polyethylene and PVC shipments. Fertilizer was up 13%, driven by increased potash exports. For the second half of 2017, our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable. Strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions coming online. Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 17% increase in volume and 7% improvement in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were both up 17% from higher natural gas prices and stronger West Coast exports, which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and are now below the five-year average. Looking forward to the second half of the year, Coal volumes will face tougher year-over-year comps, but we expect absolute volumes to be sustained sequentially if natural gas prices and export demand are maintained. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. Industrial Products revenue was up 24% on a 15% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 73% in the quarter, driven by a 128% increase in sand shipments due to improving well completion and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 20% in the quarter, driven by a 29% increase in waste shipments due to West Coast remediation projects. Looking forward, we anticipate frac sands volumes to stay strong, although new in-basin brown sand mines might temper the upside. We see growth in military and wind shipments with an offset in roofing and cement volumes due to year-over-year comps associated with weather-related reconstruction and changing market dynamics. Intermodal revenue was up 3% on a 2% increase in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume grew 2% in the quarter, driven by parcel growth as well as improved truckload market demand in the last half of the quarter. International volume was up 2% in the quarter from stronger west bound shipments and inventory restocking. Looking forward, we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by an ever-changing global supply chain. For the domestic market, implementation of electronic logbook will provide opportunities for additional over-the-road conversions. To wrap-up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slide. Over-the-road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth. We also anticipate continued progress in our plastics and Food and Refrigerated markets. Our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron Scott : Thanks Beth and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personnel injury rate increased to 0.76 versus the first half record of 0.70 achieved in 2016. The team remains fully committed to finding and addressing risks in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 4% to 3.01. While TE&Y training and infrastructure investments continue to be key pieces of our derailment prevention strategy, advanced data analytics will help us make even greater strides towards identifying and mitigating risks. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 5% versus 2016 to 2.27 as our grade crossing assessment process in collaboration with the public continues yielding positive results. Moving on to network performance. Our network performance fell short during the second quarter, which is reflected in the metrics we report each week to the AAR. Second quarter velocity was down 5% and freight car well was up 4% when compared to 2016. Severe spring weather across our served territory along with several service interruptions and outages were the primary drivers of a decline in service metrics. Looking at our resources, although our TE&Y workforce was up in about 500 employees in the second quarter while compared to the same period in 2016, we were able to effectively leverage the robust 5% increase in volume with numerous productivity initiatives we have underway. Partially offsetting some of this productivity, however, was an increase in workforce to help manage the network disruptions and outages I mentioned earlier. In addition, our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 1,000 employees, driven primarily by fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives we have implemented. All-in, our total operating workforce was down almost 600 employees in the quarter or 2% when compared to last year. As always, we continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to being agile with our resource base, the team's persistent focus on productivity continues yielding positive results in other areas such as train size. An example of our relentless focus on productivity is how we have achieved best-ever train size in our manifest trains category for eight straight quarters. Our team uses data analytics to dynamically adjust our service schedules to maximize train length while balancing our customer commitments. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switch per employee day increased 5% during the second quarter. Overall, I'm pleased with the productivity we've been able to realize thus far and I'm looking forward to further improvement as we move forward. To wrap-up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue to generate positive results on our way to incident-free environment and we will continue leveraging the strength of our franchise to improve operational performance with a focus on productivity and providing an excellent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight Jr.: Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 10% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 4% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increase to the operating expense in the quarter. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 21% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $43 million, down from about $77 million in 2016, which included a $50 million real estate gain that we reported last year. Interest expense of $179 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months. Income tax expense increased 20% to $701 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income totaled almost $1.2 billion, up 19% versus last year; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a record second quarter earnings per share of $1.45. The operating ratio was 61.8%, a 3.4 percentage point improvement from the second quarter last year. The combined impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit drove a 0.5 point improvement to the operating ratio and a $0.06 tailwind to earnings per share in the second quarter versus last year. Turning now to the topline, freight revenue of $4.9 billion was up 11% versus last year, driven by a 5% increase in volume, along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $234 million, up $147 million when compared to 2016, and up about $22 million from the first quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings, partially offset by the increase in Intermodal volumes. Core price improved to 1.5%. While we have experienced an uptick in pricing as expected, we do caution that we are continuing to see competitive pressures in our Coal and Intermodal businesses. Excluding Coal and Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation cost. Turning now to the operating expense, slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 3% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation along with higher volume. We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 5%; partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, resulting in total workforce level declining 2% in the quarter versus last year or about 800 employees. Fuel expense totaled $434 million, up 25% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 10% increase in gross ton-miles drove the increase in fuel expense in the quarter. Compared to the second quarter last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 3% while our average fuel price increased 17% to $1.69 per gallon. Purchase services and materials expense increased 5% to $597 million. The increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, partially offset by lower joint facility expenses. Turning now to slide 22, depreciation expense was $525 million, up 4% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. The increase is primarily driven by higher depreciation asset base, including our positive train control assets put in place to-date. We estimate that depreciation on PTC assets will be approximately $130 million in 2017, increasing to around $150 million in the out years, post implementation. And with respect to PTC, in addition to depreciation expense, as we've previously mentioned, we expect the remaining expense line items to increase about $150 million to $200 million annually once PTC is fully implemented. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $273 million in the quarter, which is down 5% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense and mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction. Other expenses came in at $219 million, down 10% versus last year. Lower environmental, personal injury and other costs were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items. Looking at our cash flow, cash them operations for the first half of the year totaled about $3.5 billion, down 2% when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit, which more than offset the increase in net income. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $18.4 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, which is close to our target ratio of just under two times. Dividend payments for the first half totaled $980 million, up from $925 million last year. In addition to dividends, we also bought back around 15.3 million shares, totaling over $1.6 million in the first half, an increase of around 26% over last year in terms of dollars spent. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 30% of our outstanding shares. In between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $2.6 billion to our shareholders through the first half, which represented about 118% of our first half net income. On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $110 million of productivity in the quarter. This is an improvement over the $90 million that we achieved in the first quarter and brings our first half total to around $200 million. This benefit was realized across three major categories. The first is network and train operations. This includes things like increase in train length and reducing recrews and other TE&Y expenses. The second category is equipment. This includes efforts such as using fewer locomotives and freight cars resulting reduced equipment maintenance cost. And the third category consist of support, supply, and safety where there are multiple opportunities ranging from improving fuel efficiency to reducing purchasing and other administrative expenses. With these results, we continue to progress, as expected and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $450 million productivity goal for the full year. Looking forward, we still expect full year carloading growth to be up in the low single-digit range. Third quarter carloads should strengthen somewhat from the second quarter, although they will likely be closer to flat year-over-year given the more difficult 2016 comparisons and this is particularly true for Coal. I also want to mention a couple of one-time items that will impact the third quarter. First, we will see a one-time increase in tax expense totaling about $0.04 of earnings per share to reflect a recent increase in the Illinois state income tax rate. And on the plus side, we will receive a settlement totaling approximately $0.05 earnings per share as a resolution of an ongoing litigation matter. This amount will be recognized as other income below the line. With positive full year volume, positive core price and significant productivity benefits, we are on track to improve our full year operating ratio. In longer term, we are intently focused on achieving our targeted 60% plus or minus operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55 operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect uncertainty in some economic sectors and continued strength in others. Overall, as Rob mentioned, absolute basis volume should be stronger in the second half than in the first half, although year-over-year comparisons are going to be more challenging. In this environment, we will focus on our growth opportunities. In addition, we'll continue to make progress on our G55 + 0 initiatives as we work to make Union Pacific a stronger, more efficient company. We are confident these efforts will generate topline growth, margin improvement, and greater returns for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Scott Group : So, wanted to just clarify some of the comments on Coal being flat sequentially. Are you saying that the third quarter average is going to be the same as second quarter? Because we've never seen that, so I just -- I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to say. Beth Whited : No, we weren't saying that. Sorry if that was misinterpreted. Now, we would expect third quarter to follow a traditional pattern and be up sequentially, but relatively flat for last year. Scott Group : Okay, flat on a year-over-year, okay that makes a lot more sense. Okay. And then Rob, just for you on the pricing side, I know it's not an area where you typically like to forecast specific numbers. But maybe just some insights -- we saw a tick up a little bit this quarter. Do you think that -- is it reasonable to expect that trend of kind of rebound continues into the back half of the year just given the better volume environment or tough to have visibility to that at this point? Rob Knight Jr.: Scott, we're going to continue to price-to-market and drive as positive price as we possibly can. And as you know, we're going to stay away from giving a specific pricing number other than to reiterate that we expect to yield above inflation dollars. But we also pointed out -- Beth and I both did, that we continue to face pressures in the Coal and Intermodal groups. So, we'll see how all that plays out. Scott Group : And just given the better volume environment, does the market -- I understand the competitive comments, does the broader markets feel like it's a better from a pricing standpoint just given you've had a few quarters now volume growth or you're not ready to say that. Beth Whited : I would say that there are a lot of competitive factors going on out there on the plus side. We are seeing truck prices just beginning to firm and that gives us some hope that that will continue throughout the rest of the year, especially with ELDs coming online. But the other competitive factors that we see in Coal and Intermodal aren't easy. So, you just kind of have to make your own production about what you think might happen. Scott Group : May I ask just a quick follow-up, how about in just grain with grain prices going up, how does that impact you grain tariffs going forward? Beth Whited : Well, let me see how to answer that. I would say that we certainly want to price and get value in the market at every opportunity. Grain prices going up will, hopefully, bring more volume to us and provide us with a revenue opportunity and we'll just have to see how the pricing opportunities play out from that. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Just following-up on the pricing side, on the increased Coal pricing you're talking about. Are there major contracts up for bid that you're seeing this get more intense? Is this more a commentary on a shift of export coal? Just want to see as given that you easy comps that you had now started a little tougher, I want to see where that's heading towards. Beth Whited : Are you asking a volume or a price question? Ken Hoexter : Its price but I want to understand what's leading into that price competition. Is it that you're seeing more new -- or more of bids going on right now, major bids that what you're seeing competitor step up. Is it because of the export side? I just want to understand where you're seeing the pricing competition? Beth Whited : I think that we continue to see competition kind of across the book of business. But we aren't at any sort of unusual level of contract negotiation during this period. It's just kind of -- when you think about our whole base and the contracts that we negotiate overtime as we are renegotiating contracts that market -- it's still very competitive. Ken Hoexter : Yes. And nothing on the export? Is that--? Beth Whited : No, the export business, as you know for us, is relatively smaller. Ken Hoexter : Still smaller. Beth Whited : We have had some nice opportunities, but that's not as -- I mean, it's certainly still competitive, but that's not where we're seeing the most pressure. Ken Hoexter : Great. And then for a follow-up. Great detail Rob on the productivity initiatives that you provided here. Is this -- when you look at the equipment side and the like, is that -- do you see the locomotives -- are you increasing them out that you're parking is part of the productivity and the cars can you talk a little bit about kind of where that stands. You've given those numbers in the past. Lance Fritz : Yes, let's let Cameron address that. Cameron Scott : Several years ago, we started initiative in our low horsepower fleet and that initiative net to about 500 locomotives we'd put in storage. Some of those have been sold. Some of those releases that we returned. We've turned that same group of employees towards our high horsepower fleet. And I don't think we'll achieve quite 500, but there's plenty of opportunity for us to rationalize what we're doing with our high horsepower fleet. Lance Fritz : I want to say Cameron is referencing there from this point forward. He's already got what is in the neighborhood of 1,000 high horsepower locomotive in storage as we speak. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thank you very much for the thoughts. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just a follow-up on the positive train control comments. Rob, that's very helpful to give us more details. I was wondering if you could just clarify one thing, are those costs included in your long-term OR guidance, I assume they are, but I just want to confirm. And then we hear a lot about the cost, what are some of the benefits maybe, Cam, you think could come out of the system when it's fully operational? Rob Knight Jr.: Yes, let me quickly address the cost question, Brian. Yes, all of those costs are embedded in our targeted 60 OR by 2019 and 55 beyond. So, those are challenges that we have to overcome, but they're embedded in the thought process. And in terms of the benefits? Lance Fritz : Cam? Cameron Scott : We're implementing about 40% of our network at this point. And the technology is working very well. There will always be glitches and bugs that we need to upgrade. But so far, it's a very solid technology. As we get fully implemented, we'll be looking for every productivity and efficiency that we can squeeze out of that system. I don't have anything right now to report to you on that. Lance Fritz : Giving you a little bit more techni-color [ph] -- this is Lance. The PTC foundation gives you an umbrella of communication capability because of what's required for PTC in and of itself. And it puts a lot of technology and computing power on to our locomotives that at some point could be used for other purposes in the future. It's important to note that it's not -- when we think about productivity from positive train control foundation, we're not talking about taking what already exist and somehow redeploying it in a way that's highly productive. Whatever we do is likely going to require an incremental either capital or operating expense investment. And we'll make those decision based on the returns that would be generated from whatever those projects are. So, it forms a foundation in your mind to think about that foundation as a robust umbrella of communication capability and computing power. And from that point forward, maybe that's a foundation we can use for the productivity. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. That's very helpful. I'm just -- the timing I now we've got one year extensions possibly across the Board for the industry if you could just remind us when you -- what's the current prospect for going fully online, is that a 2020 event? Lance Fritz : We're going to be fully implemented -- or installed and able to implement, that is turn on, on every mile that's required late in 2018. And in the way the law is written, if we're in that position, then we can basically request the Department of Transportation an extension to 2020, which we will do because we'll want to use that time to debug the system. While Cameron has mentioned that the system is operating and is functional and doing what it's intended to do, it still has bugs that rob us of precious capacity. And so we'll want to take those two years to continue to debug the system. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And just one quick follow-up on the hiring front. [Indiscernible] almost the same percent as volume realize there is some perhaps one-time items in there. But just in general, Lance, can you tell us what you're seeing trends in hiring? There's some pretty great chunks of growth coming in the areas that might be a little bit more regionalized like perhaps like Coal, and flat to down in slightly other areas. So, how hard will you be finding it to get ahead of those recoveries and meet demand in kind of just-in-time with the training programs you have? And should we expect small furlough for the freight recession to really kind of rob you from some productivity as you probably might not get all the same people you have back, but maybe a little bit lower level of experience when you do start to hire again. Lance Fritz : Brian, let's unpack that in three pieces. The first piece is, your right. With TE&Y headcount up 4% in the second quarter versus volume up 5%, that's not quite the kind of productivity we would expect. I think that's accountable to the weather and service related interruptions and a little bit more sluggish network as Cameron pointed out. And he and his team is working diligently to get that back. The second point that you were asking about was overall hiring and what's going on in that world. Recall, we came into the year with a fair number of TE&Y employees on furlough. So, the first thing we do is we call them back from furlough or from their alternative work and training board service. We've been doing that and we've also in certain pockets, had to go out and start up a hiring class. That's a relatively small amount in comparison to the amount of employees that we're bringing back on furlough. And in terms of are we able to find employees when we do need to hire, the answer is yes. And the TE&Y craft, we have very attractive jobs and in the areas where we want to hire with maybe one or two very specific exceptions, we can find employees that we need. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, great. Thanks a lot for all the detail. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning. Cameron question for you on the productivity side. You mentioned there were some network disruptions that added to the incremental headcount. And I'm just wondering if you kind the mentioned that for us? And then also speak to the ability to kind of keep pushing forward with some of these train length initiatives and your productivity initiatives as volume growth moderates in the back half of the year? Cameron Scott : I'll start with train size. Our team, as we mentioned, during eight straight quarters, has demonstrated a capability to find additional opportunities on train size while meeting customer commitments. And there is, as I mentioned before, still plenty of headroom in almost every train category in our business, with the exception of Coal. So, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us on productivity with train size. In relation to some of the outages, probably the best example I can give you was an unfortunate barge strike to one of our key network lanes in Louisiana. We've been out for seven weeks now rebuilding that bridge. That has caused us to wheel our transportation plan around that outage, adding costs, adding locomotives, adding employees that were not intended as we started the year. We should get that key route back in service here in the next week and that will normalize not only our cost structure, but our customers will see a more solid service that they expect from us. David Vernon : And in terms of sort of dimensioning that in terms of numbers around the extra heads or impact on earnings, is there any way for us to think about what it could have been here in the second quarter versus what it was because some of these one-time things? Or is it too small to try to adjust out? Rob Knight Jr.: David, let me -- this is Rob, let me try to answer. I mean we're not going to break that out. I mean it's kind of in the mix and we admit it, as Lance indicated that ratio of the 4% versus the 5% volume, is not what we strive for. But exactly, what could have been is hard to put a fine point on. David Vernon : Okay. And maybe this is a follow-up, Beth, with regards to ELDs, what are you hearing from your Intermodal partners on what kind of impact are expecting from this not only just in the U.S. implementation, but I also understand there's some speculation that the Mexican government may follow with an ELD set of guidelines in the 2018 as well. Beth Whited : I don't have a comment on the Mexico piece. I haven't talked to anybody about that at this point. So, that will be a good follow-up for me. But I think everything you read says that they expect full ELD implementation to be kind of 3% to 5% sort of capacity impact. I think some people are skeptical about how well it will be enforced. And so you've got a range in there in terms of how much impact it will have. But certainly we're very optimistic that it's going to help drive some tightening in the truck market and consequential price increases with rate increases in trucks, which will give us an opportunity to convert more volume and hopefully, get some price of our own. David Vernon : And we should start to see that in the back half of this year and in the next year or is there going to be a bigger lag? Beth Whited : It feels like it's a pretty late in the fourth quarter event and more of a next year item. David Vernon : Great. Thanks a lot for your time guys. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks. So, frac sand has obviously seen strength in the last couple of quarters. So, I was hoping you could give us an indication of the mix of white and brown. And I guess more importantly, given some of the expectations for the Permian to be self-sufficient with local brown sand, how do we think about that with respect to your volumes and mix going forward? Beth Whited : So, currently, we would say and you can read different people say different things that the Permian is roughly 15% brown and 85% white sand. And the demand this year, call it 28 million or 29 million tons. We see estimates going into next year where there are proposed mines that would bring on anywhere from 20 million to 40 million or 50 million tons and perhaps demand in the Permian being in that 40 million to 50 million tons. I'm not sure how quickly that will happen. We certainly feel good about Permian white sand this year. We're working on solution to try to be a well provider in the brown sand market as well and we do a fair amount of that today from other Texas location. I -- certainly it will swing away from white sand as a percentage over -- I think kind of quarter-by-quarter as we move into next year. We don't really have a prediction for what that looks like for us in 2018. But like I said, our focus will be on working to support the white sand guys that are continuing to shift and developing alternatives for the brown sand. Allison Landry : Okay, got it. Thanks. And then if I could ask about the volume guidance, you obviously gave the expectations for flat year-over-year in Q3 and sort of implied a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. So, I'm wondering if you can help us think through that and maybe handicap whether or not you think volumes could be up in the fourth quarter? Rob Knight Jr.: Allison, this is Rob and we haven't given specific volume guidance in the fourth quarter. But so you're right, it could be a range. I mean we're hopeful that the economy would continue to move in the right direction and our third quarter, as I pointed out in my comments, while we envision that being kind of flattish year-over-year, we do see it sequentially growing from where we are today, where we finish in the second quarter. So, stay tuned in terms of how the world plays out in the fourth quarter. Allison Landry : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Colin & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Hey, good morning everyone. Two quick questions. Rob, I wanted to talk a little bit about your comments that we are aware the proper level for adjusted debt to EBITDA that you look at. How should we think about your cadence of share repurchases going forward? Is that going to slow a little bit or are you expecting to keep about the same pace? Rob Knight Jr.: Well, Jason, as you know, we don't have a set number. We don't give specific guidance. We'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of the pace at which we buy, so I couldn't begin to give you exactly what that cadence will look like. Markets will dry. But I would just tell you that in terms of the focus that we have in the organization is driving more cash. I mean so as we look at the metric, while we're close to that targeted number, as I pointed out, we still have room to go in terms of generating positive cash in the business and that gives us the greatest opportunity to continue to move forward. Jason Seidl : Okay. And I wanted to jump back on your Ag outlook a little bit. Talk about how exports in the quarter impact the arc. So, obviously, you don't talk about pricing, but let's just talk about the overall arc from the mix and what should we expect sequentially going forward about exports and how that would look against your arc in the third and fourth quarter? Beth Whited : So, in the quarter, we did have strong grain exports shipments, especially with wheat. And obviously that's a longer length of haul almost all the time. We do see -- we did see some pretty low barge prices, so we did move a fair amount in the river. So, it impacts our arc positively, but maybe not as much historically has just because of the river move. As you move into the third and fourth quarter, you're going to see quite a bit less export grain, particularly in the third quarter because we had a really strong third quarter last year. And we're now going to be challenged by pretty strong global availability of grain in markets where they have a significant currency advantage. So, it'll -- I would say a negative arc impact versus last year in the third quarter. I don't have a [Indiscernible] for you. Jason Seidl : Okay. So, Beth all things being equal, as you look to 3Q and 4Q and comp that versus 2Q likely going to be down compared to 2Q based on the mix? Beth Whited : The arc, I don't know. Jason Seidl : The arc. Beth Whited : I'm sorry. I don't have a prediction of that for you. The volume -- yes, on the export side. Jason Seidl : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time as always guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey thanks. Good morning. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Chris Wetherbee : I wanted to talk about productivity a little bit and understand maybe the cadence for the back half of the year. So, you have $150 million to $200 million left to go. And in the first half, you sort of had a stronger performance and a better volume environment. I guess my question is, as you see sort of volume comps get a bit tougher there, what is that variability in cadence for the back half of the year do you think if 4Q doesn't turn out to be positive from a volume standpoint or you're more likely to be in the lower end of the guidance. I'm just trying to get some sensitivity around that for the second half. Lance Fritz : Hi, Chris, this is Lance. I'll let Rob speak specifically to the guidance, which is $350 million to $400 million for the year. But in terms of the mechanics of the productivity, it's Cam and the team and the rest of the organization are constantly working the projects that we have in front of us right now. So, that Rob pointed out three big segments. In the transportation side, it's about train lengths and be more productive in switching and locals. It can be more productive in our engineering and mechanical workforces where we've got projects underway and candidly we've been very straightforward and saying I think we've got more opportunity to be more productive in our general administrative and support functions. So, you'll see us take action on all of those in the second half of the year. Rob Knight Jr.: Yes. If I can, I would just add, Chris, that as you've heard us comment many times before we're not going to stop at the $350 million range. And we try not to use volume as an excuse. Certainly, volume is our friend and it gives us more optionality in terms of the productivity initiatives. But as we have done for many, many years and that is that we have a mindset that we're still going to aggressively go after the productivity initiatives that Lance outlined that are in front of us that we're aggressively pursuing and in spite of what the year-over-year volume is. And again, we still predict, by the way. Our guidance is that volume for the full year is going to be up in the low single-digits. So, the fact that it's, say, flattish in the third quarter year-over-year, I don't think that's going to impact or slowdown any of our productivity initiatives. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. All right. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then Beth maybe a question on the Coal side. So, you've given some helpful color around the third quarter. I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood how you think about sort of finishing out the year relative to what we've been hearing a little bit from the producer side within PRB coal. And if there is the ability to sort of make commitments to the extent that there's demand there in the fourth quarter depending on what weather does and stockpile do. I guess our sense is that production levels on the mine level might end up falling short of flattish in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts around that if you have any. Beth Whited : Well, at this point, we haven't considered that we would have significant production shortages in the fourth quarter. And we were definitely still thinking looks flattish. I suppose it all depends on what plays out with third quarter demand and hot weather and the producers are in the place where it makes economical sense to them I would guess that they will keep producing in for that. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Good morning. Wanted to ask you a little more on the Coal and Intermodal competitive pressures that you highlighted. I think -- I want to say it's maybe the third quarter last year that you first started talking about these pressures. And we have seen better Coal volumes certainly over the last couple of quarters in Coal. What you think it's a dynamic you might see for those competitive pressures ease? Is that really a function where the natural gas price is? Is it just a market price is lower for coal transport than what your book is priced at? So, it's really a multi-year headwind and repricing to market? Or how would be think about kind of the drivers that competitive pressure and how long the duration might be? Beth Whited : It's pretty hard to make any sort of prediction about things that are happening in the competitive market when the person you're talking about isn\u2019t yourself. So, I don't probably have any guidance to give you there. Our focus is just going to be on making sure that we're getting a reinvestable price that makes sense to us as we renew deals and go out to bid for new books of business. Lance Fritz : Tom, this is Lance. Of course, anytime the environment improves from a standpoint of more economic opportunity for all the competition in the marketplace, more volume opportunities, anytime that's the case, that's a better environment to compete in. So, we're looking forward to that being the case at some point in the future. Thomas Wadewitz : What about the Intermodal side? I know you had referred in the past about the turmoil with the steamships and the consolidation and obviously with content and so forth. Do you think I guess there's more activity going on, do you have any visibility of that stabilizing and maybe pricing in the international Intermodal stabilizing or is that something that's probably continues for a while? Beth Whited : I think that the steamship lines are still shaking things out. And while I think their economics are better, I don't think they're in a situation where they're making a lot of money and maybe not even making money. So, in that environment, I think that the pressure remains for them to try to be very economically competitive in what they do. So, we'll see. I think that may take a little bit longer to shake out. Lance Fritz : Recall, Tom that those are -- that's a moving part from the standpoint of sometimes those consolidations and partnerships benefit us and sometimes they don't. Regardless, we take that competitive landscape and compete for the business that makes sense to us from an economic return and compete aggressively for it. Thomas Wadewitz : Great, great. Okay. And then just a quick follow-on. On the Chemicals side, what's the timing when you really see the impact from the new plants? Are you already seeing that? Or is there kind of a timeframe when that would be a bigger volume impact from the new production coming on in the Gulf? Beth Whited : Yes, so it's going to be kind of a slow start I think. You start to see I think one or two plants really making meaningful production in 2017 and that's really pretty late in the year and with 2018 being a more significant impact. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : All right. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, thanks everybody. Thanks for getting me in here. I wanted to ask you on the outlook for the back half. You do typically see a nice step down in OR sequentially. But obviously, there's some difficult comparisons as you mentioned possible mix challenges as well. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there and maybe your confidence or the company's ability to actually lower OR sequentially against that backdrop? Rob Knight Jr.: Yes, this is Rob. I mean we don't really get specific quarterly OR guidance. You're right. Traditionally, that's the way it plays out. There's a lot of moving parts. We'll see what mix does. It's been favorable thus far this year. We're going to continue to drive pricing as Beth has talked about. We're going to continue to be aggressive on our productivity initiatives as we've all talked about and those are the levers. And volume, we think is going to be our friend certainly in the third quarter improving from the second quarter. And we'll just have to see how the numbers play out. But again, we're confident and pleased with the progress we've made thus far this year and confident in our ability to improve the operating ratio year-over-year. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Maybe just if I could have a follow-up and just be a little bit more specific as it relates to maybe the Automotive business and also the Chemical business as it relates to the auto production. I mean, North American light vehicle productions expect to be down about 6% in the third quarter. I think some of that, obviously, has to do with the big three changeovers that maybe you're not as exposed to versus the eastern rails. And then if I'm not mistaken, there are significant amount of chemical carloads that are also tied to auto production. So, if you could just help us think about both the Auto and Chemical franchise in light of maybe the sharp drop off in production and maybe the impact it makes there? Thanks. Beth Whited : So, we have seen strength in plastics this year on the PVC and PE side, which -- and PP is really the stuff that goes into auto. So, I would agree with you that there's been a little bit of an impact there. It hasn't been very significant fall off in PC, but the strength is really coming on the PVC and the PE side. And I don't think that would be something that we would probably be in a situation where we're calling out later in the year on the straight Auto side. It does feel like there's weakness there and that, that will continue throughout the rest of the year and we'll just have to see if the consumer goes back and start buying cars or not. Lance Fritz : Bear in mind we have an opportunity still and it's a significant opportunity to penetrate further inbound truck for auto parts to auto manufacturing. There's still plenty of opportunity to convert that into Intermodal or box car product. And as the second quarter demonstrated, I think our finished vehicles were down 4%, but auto parts were up 2%. We expect to keep going after that in the second half of the year. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the questions. Congrats on a good quarter. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Cameron Scott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone. And thanks for getting us on the call here. Lance, I wonder if you could just give your investors a little bit of confidence here because we've been hearing a lot about precision railroading and how that can drive significant improvement at one of your peers. But you guys have had some pretty significant OR targets out there for some time now. So, can you tell us -- just what are the drivers to achieve the 60 OR and then even beyond the 55. And how confident are you today versus maybe a couple of years ago? Lance Fritz : Let's start with my confidence level, which is, it's never been higher. That's -- it's really wonderful to be speaking to your question coming off the quarter that we just had where we've demonstrated on what I would consider relatively modest volumes and ability to generate significant operating ratio improvement and productivity. So, let's talk about how we're generating that productivity. Getting just a little bit deeper on those three areas that Rob and Cam talked about. When you're thinking about the train network, what we've been doing to this point is we're taking our -- the way our plan is organized and deconstructing it by lane, looking for opportunities to grow train size while maintaining the fundamental aspects of the plan with an eye towards making sure that our customer service product is as good as it possibly can be the best in the marketplace. As we look forward, there's an opportunity to co-mingle some of those service products and we're investigating that as we speak, thinking through what does that mean from a service product perspective and from a productivity perspective. We think there's pretty good juice there. And so while we've done a great job of growing train size to this point, we think there's some incremental opportunities we look forward in our train network. When we think about how we conduct ourselves with our mechanical, our carman employees, our craft professionals in the engineering world and some of the contracting work that we do in both, there's plenty of opportunities and we've got projects in all of those areas looking for ways to take out, for instance, leased and rented equipment, contracting work that's just not high value add or can be done more efficiently and more efficiently finding ways to invest in equipment that allows us to be way more productive on labor components and have a really attractive return on that investment. And then when you think about our ability to generate more productivity on the general and administrative and support cost side of our world and inclusive of purchasing material and supplies, we've been making great progress in those areas and there's lots of opportunities to come. And we've got plans and clear-eyed opportunities there that we are developing and ultimately will be taken advantage of. So, as we sit here, the team could not be more confident in being able to achieve a 60 plus/minus operating ratio by 2019. And of course, we're going to do that as quickly as we can. And then we\u2019re -- immediately thereafter, we're just going to keep it up on our way to a 55 operating ratio, again, as soon as we can. Another thing that gives us confidence is looking backwards at our track record. We had some fits and starts here recently, mostly driven by significant volume drops. But even in that context, we've had good solid operating ratio improvement over a very long period of time and we've demonstrated we know how to do it. We're going to keep doing it. Brandon Oglenski : Lance, I appreciate that. How should investors think about the sustainable rates of improvement on the margin? And you did talk about growth in those comments as well. I mean how contingent is this on growth? Are there still absolute cost buckets that you think you can attack over the next couple of years that would help drive margins higher and the OR lower? Lance Fritz : Yes. So, we talked, Brandon, about three buckets that drive OR improvement. Pure productivity whatever the volume is and we'll continue to get that price, which is related to what the value is that we're bringing to our customers and how we're competing in our markets and we'll continue to generate that and growth. Growth certainly helps and we're looking for ways in markets either new ones to penetrate, more business with existing customers, greater geographic reach, however we can maximize franchise and we have. We will be pulling the levers on all three of those areas all the time as we move forward. And it just depends on what the economy brings to us, what we're able to do as to exactly the role with each lever plays going forward. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. So, just following up on your -- on those three lines and going into pure productivity. You've got a long-term target there. You're kind of the mid-50s and up at around 62 now. What is the timeframe? I mean, just ballpark. Is this a two-year, three-year, five-year kind of productivity attack? Is this something that you can front end load? Are there projects that you're looking on that you're going to pull the trigger on that can really lead to a revamping of the infrastructure that you have right now that applies to the business you run? Is there anything that you can give us tangibly that we can kind of look into our models and maybe not into 2019 when you hit 60, but out within a reasonable timeframe after that to be at that mid-50s? Is there anything you can point us to? Lance Fritz : Yes, I'm not sure I'm going to be very helpful in building up the model for you. I'll tell you we're going to get there just as quickly as we can. And as we sit here and look at the different opportunities we have in front of us, the projects that we've already got launched are the ones that we're defining prior to launch. There's plenty of opportunities and some of those might surprise us and deliver outsized productivity rapidly. And some might be a lot more pick and shovel work that takes a bit more time. I can tell you we're scanning the environment regardless of industry, whether it's other railroad peers or any other competitors or customers of ours to find ideas that we can implement in our own environment to both accelerate our productivity and to generate productivity. Walter Spracklin : And is there anything in that scanning that might lead to a step function move? Like a complete overhaul of hump yards and slashing them -- or your hump yards in your opinion, fully utilized. Is there anything that you think that through scanning might lead to not a gradual but a step function move in your infrastructure? Lance Fritz : Yes, we're going to learn from everything we see and observe and deconstruct it and see if it makes sense for our network and our franchise. I'll just remind you that on our network and franchise, we have a very robust manifest product that requires a fair amount of car switching and our lowest cost car switching for us happens to be in our highly utilized hump yards. So, at this point, as we look forward, I'm not so sure you're going to see a lot of change in that area. Plus you might see change in other areas like how we define our networks and products and perhaps the co-mingling of some of our service products so that we can both generate a better service product for our customers and more productivity for our shareholders. Bear in mind that we've got four stakeholders and we're serving them all at the same time; our customers, employees, the communities that we serve in; and you, our shareholder. Walter Spracklin : Moving on to this other bucket, which is pricing. Now you've noted that you kind of excluding some of the problem areas in coal and others, you are booking 2% to 3% price, which is great. In the problem areas, do you tend to be -- you're going to be affected by contracts that have been signed that would probably have some long length to them. Two questions on that. When do those start coming off, the ones that are keeping your pricing down in those problem areas? And at this point, are you booking new contracts in those problem areas above that depressed level in prior periods? Beth Whited : So, I don't think we're going to give any real guidance on past or future pricing in specific contracts. But I would tell you is the competition is as fierce today in Coal and Intermodal as it has been over the last, I guess, we've been talking about this for about a year. So, that's kind of where we are. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks very much. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes in the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Justin Long : So, you said earlier that Coal volumes should be about flat year-over-year in the third quarter. And that translates into a sequential improvement of about 20% in Coal volumes. And that's really all the sequential improvement you need to get for consolidated volumes to be flat on a year-over-year basis in 3Q. So, I guess saying it another way, it basically implies that non-Coal volumes stay flat sequentially. With that in mind, could you just give some more color on non-Coal volumes sequentially? And what's you're expecting to get better and what you're expecting to get worse in 3Q? Lance Fritz : Rob, you want to take the guidance part of that, please? Rob Knight Jr.: Yes. Justin I would just say you may be taking two fine slide role to the -- what we talked about. Coal, we're giving some of a directional comment on our overall volumes and on Coal. I wouldn't take that as literally as you have because the factors that will drive coal demand will continue to be gas prices, weather, economy, I mean, all those factors that could change exactly with the cadence is in the third quarter. So, I mean our other -- so our guidance, again, to Lance's point, our guidance all-in is kind of flattish. It could be either side of that. We'll see. We want to be as high as possible, but flattish year-over-year with sequential improvement from here. Lance Fritz : And Beth you want to just maybe talk a little bit about other markets and what's going on? Beth Whited : Yes. So, there will be ins and outs in all other markets. There always are. I just remind you Ag was pretty strong last year and -- so the third quarter is a tough comp for that and all the other markets are going to continue to evolve as we move through the quarter. But as Rob said, we expect to be flattish. Justin Long : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe secondly, Kansas City has talked a lot about the refined product opportunity in Mexico and it sounds like those shipments have ticked up in the second quarter for their business. Do you see this as an opportunity for your network at all or just from a geographic standpoint, is this not really a needle mover? Beth Whited : It's a small and emerging market for us right now. We are doing a reasonable amount of traffic. I wouldn't call it substantial amount of traffic and finish fuels into Mexico both in partnership with KCSM and with the Ferromex. And we were probably a big mover early into the LPG space. And we are still seeing a lot of propane moving into Mexico. The finished fuels have been a little slower to take off because there's not a lot of terminal infrastructure in Mexico to handle them. But we see it as a reasonable opportunity over the period until more infrastructure is built in Mexico. Lance Fritz : Justin, I would remind you and all of our listeners at this point, we enjoy robust franchise to and from Mexico because we serve all six major rail gateways. We enjoy about 70% of all rail cross-border traffic to and from Mexico. So we will get our fair share. Justin Long : Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Keith Schoonmaker : Hi. I'd like to ask a question on your model. In your presentation, you mentioned parcel growth. I don't know that was a unit called out a lot in the past but as a driver for the quarter. Could I ask just in the elaboration on this, the broadly how material are parcels to your franchise? It's trending upward rapidly in line with B2C and downline fulfillment. And can you elaborate maybe challenges or investments you've had to make to serve this? Beth Whited : Yes, so we think about our business in domestic and international, and then within the domestic space, it's kind of truckload and premium and parcel would fall into that premium segment and we have seen some nice growth in it. I think a fair amount of that is being driven by e-commerce. And so that's enabled us to participate in that, and it's been pretty exciting for us. In terms of investments that we've had to make to support it, we've been able to utilize to a pretty significant extent the facilities that we already had in place for Intermodal shipments and we also do support it from time-to-time with additional train starts if that investment makes sense for us. So, that's where we are at this point. It's been a fun market for us to watch emerge. Keith Schoonmaker : Good. Thank you, Beth. As a follow-up, my second question, I guess, maybe this is for Cameron. A lot of times when you see a big volume influx like we've seen last couple of quarters in coal or this quarter in international -- in industrial products it's -- can compromise margins, yet you've handled it pretty deftly and actually set records in margins. Is this simply more train starts you had available locomotives and personnel furloughed? Or maybe you could elaborate on some of the challenges in bringing that volume on so rapidly? Cameron Scott : It is always our stated objective to take Beth's volume and layer it on top of our current train start network. And as I mentioned before, there is lots of headroom in almost every train category that we have to continue to do that. The coal marketplace for us in train size is fairly optimized. There are still opportunities but it is fairly optimized. So, really in stepping up to the plate with beautiful volume growth from Beth in Coal is making sure we're matching appropriate manpower planning and locomotive planning to handle the volumes as they come online. And I think we've accomplished that very nicely here in the second quarter. Keith Schoonmaker : Probably industry is a lot more complex than coal, many more destinations and origins than somewhat repeatable business in the coal franchise though. Would just simply having ample capacity to add lengths to trains, Cam? Cameron Scott : Yes, it is. And you are correct. That does become very complex very quickly. And our service design team and our network planning team has done a very nice job, whether it's a regional opportunity or a big system network opportunity to take that growth and layer it right on top of our current program. Keith Schoonmaker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered. So, let me just ask one on utilization. I think we understand a lot of the factors that impacted the West Coast flow through in terms of terminal dwell and average train speed. You briefly mentioned it in your comments today. Can you talk about where you're in getting that to the levels you want to? And at what point do you think we start to see more positive year-over-year comps in those two areas? Lance Fritz : Cameron? Cameron Scott : You're absolutely right. In the first quarter, with the Western region impact, we took a pretty substantial hit on both velocity and car dwell. Largely, that velocity in the Western region has returned to us. It's been a little -- taken a little bit longer for us to recover in the Western region than we anticipated, but we feel confident in the second half that Western region will start delivering the extra velocity and improved internal performance that we expect out of them. The Southern region, as I mentioned, has a bridge outage that will be resolved here in a week. They also have very heavy renewal capital programming. So, it makes it a complicated network down south. As soon as we get that bridge back in service, we anticipate the southern region will come right back to anticipated velocity as well. Jeffrey Kauffman : One follow-up to that. I could be wrong on my statistics here. But I seem to remember when the weather gets below a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because rails get brittle. When the weather gets above a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because the track gets soft. We've had some pretty extreme weather this quarter, particularly in the South and Southwest. Is any of that impacting the system? And can you discuss whether I'm off target on that? Cameron Scott : No, you are correct. Heat orders are applied when we reach certain temperature thresholds and it has been a nice warm summer. About the only area of our business where that becomes impactful is when you're looking at high-premium intermodal product. That does tend to retard the maximum train speed that you'd like to run when it comes to that high-premium Intermodal product. The rest of the network is largely unaffected by those heat-slow orders. Lance Fritz : Hey Jeff, the other aspect of heat is, we're in the outdoor business. So, we really got to help our craft professionals kind of watch their health when it gets to temperatures like we're in right now. And that can slowdown work to some degree because they've got to make sure they take breaks. They got to get out of the heat, be able to keep their body temperature reasonable. And you can just imagine working eight or 10 or 12 hours in the kind of environment we have now. That can have an impact on an individual's productivity. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay. Well, thank you for your answers and good luck. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for fitting me in here this morning. The operating cash flow was down about 2% year-to-date on mid-teens growth in net income. Could you just walk us through if anything there is timing related? And kind of how you expect that to shake out in net income for the full year? And then maybe a similar comment longer term. Do we expect to grow cash flow in line? Maybe a little better than or a little worse than net income over time? Thanks. Rob Knight Jr.: Yes, Bascom, there was a timing issue with when you look at year-over-year. You're right; the reported numbers show it down. There was, call it, $400 million year-over-year delta on the bonus depreciation. And that is kind of front-end loaded for this year. So, we'll see how it kind of plays out for the balance of the year. But longer term, our goal is to continue to drive that number positively, clearly. And we have every expectation that given all of the productivity initiatives we have underway that, that will be a very strong base. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with you again in October. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

LLC Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this the time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning, everybody. And welcome to the Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call, with me here today in Omaha, are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion for the third quarter of 2017. This equates to $1.50 per share, which is up 10% over last year. Total volume decreased 1% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume decreased in four of our six commodity groups, driven primarily by a 10% decrease and agricultural products and associated grain carloadings. Partially offsetting this volume was a 15% increase in industrial products, with particular strength in frac sand shipments. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.8%, which was up 0.7 points from the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, our company faced the unprecedented challenge of Hurricane Harvey. I want to thank the men and women of Union Pacific who worked tirelessly and heroically to quickly and safely to restore our network and our operations from the storm and the related flooding. Given these challenges, I'm pleased with our results, and look forward to continuing to build on the foundation provided by our six-track value strategy. Our team will give you more of the details on the third quarter, starting with Beth. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Lance, and good morning. We announced during the third quarter that effective January 1, we will transition reporting to our newly established four business groups : agricultural, energy, industrial, and premium. Until then, we will continue to report on the six business teams. For the third quarter, our volume was down 1%, driven primarily by agricultural products, automotive and chemicals, with an offset in industrial products. We generated positive net core pricing of nearly 2% in the quarter, with continued coal-related and intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition. We saw a 4% increase in freight revenue due to a 5% increase in average revenue per car, with a slight offset due to decreased carloads. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag products revenue was down 2% on a 10% volume decrease and a 9% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 19%, primarily driven by a delay in harvest and lower U.S. exports of feed grains in wheat as a result of high global inventories. This was partially offset by domestic strength in the Mid-South poultry and Idaho dairy markets. Grain products carloads were down 10%, predominantly due to weaker competitiveness of U.S. exports rail (03:21) shipments to the Gulf Coast. Food and refrigerated volumes were at 5%, driven by continued strength in import beer with strong summer demand. Domestic sugar shipments also remained strong with the movement of surplus inventory to accommodate new crop production. Looking at the rest of the year, we may see some benefit from the delayed harvest. However, high global production of both feed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will continue to create headwinds in our export markets. Domestic business is expected to remain stable. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will see growth driven by Cold Connect penetration, weather recovery and tightening truck capacity. We also anticipate sustained strength in sugar and import beer trending with consumer demand. Automotive revenue was down 3% in the quarter, on a 5% decrease in volume, and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 9% as a result of lower production levels in response to softer vehicle sales, coupled with high inventories as well as planned outages for model changeovers. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and production growth in Mexico. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the third quarter, down 3% from third quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand maintained our parts volume, despite lower overall production levels. The US light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17 million units, down almost 3% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5 million. For the rest of the year, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trends, high inventory, and rising incentives. Hurricane replacements may provide some short-term opportunity. Chemicals revenue was up 2% for the quarter, on a 5% decrease in volume, and 8% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 17% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 82% to about 2,000 carloads, due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil, was down 2% in the quarter. Plastics carloads were down 6%, with seven plastics plants impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Fertilizer was up 6%, driven by continued strength in potash exports. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our chemicals franchise is expected to grow modestly. We are back to normal pre-hurricane levels. In addition, we anticipate strength in plastics with continued domestic and export demand, coupled with the new facilities and expansions coming online. Coal revenue decreased 2% for the quarter, on a 3% decrease in volume, and flat average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin was down 4%, while other regions were up 6%, as coal unit and unloading outages reduced PRB volume. Colorado/Utah loadings benefited from strong export shipments to the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast. Natural gas prices were similar to a year ago and coal stockpiles have been below normal for the majority of the year. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, coal volumes are expected to be flat versus fourth quarter 2016, due to normalized demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. Industrial products revenue was up 26%, on a 15% increase in volume, and a 10% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 80% in the quarter, driven by a 120% increase in sand shipments, due to improving well completions and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 23% in the quarter, driven by a 22% increase in waste, as a result of West Coast remediation projects and a 130% increase in military shipments, due to increased deployments and rotations. Looking forward, we anticipate proppant intensity, well completions and business development to drive continued growth through the fourth quarter. We see growth in military and waste shipments, with an offset in rock volumes due to less projects work in the south. Intermodal revenue was up 3% on a flat volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per quarter. Domestic volume was down 1%, due to a challenging competitive environment, offset by partial growth. International volume was up 1% in the quarter from stronger west-bound shipments. Excluding the Hanjin impact in 2016, international volume would have been up 5%. We expect international intermodal volume to hover around 2016 levels for the remainder of the year. We have now lapped the effects of the Hanjin bankruptcy, creating easier comps. However, we expect slowing from normal seasonality, as well as headwinds from ocean carrier industry consolidation and increasing overcapacity in the fourth quarter, resulting in lower ocean rates. For the domestic market, we remain optimistic that truck capacity will tighten further in the fourth quarter, providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over-the-road conversions. We are also well positioned for holiday sales growth later in the quarter. To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. We anticipate continued progress in our food and refrigerated, plastics, fertilizer and sand markets. Over-the-road conversions in both automotive and intermodal will also continue to present opportunities for growth. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth for the remainder of the year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.78, almost even with the year-to-date record of 0.77 achieved in 2016. Although we continue generating near-record safety results, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 5% to 2.97. And in public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 1% versus the 2016 to 2.52, as we remain focused on improving crossings where we can impact public safety the most. Moving on to network performance, as reported to the AAR, velocity declined 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. As Lance mentioned, we faced a particularly tough challenge in the quarter, dealing with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. The record-setting rains negatively impacted Gulf Coast operations and our network fluidity system wide. In the aftermath of the storm, over 1,700 miles of track were out of service, and more than 2,400 route miles were affected. The team showed tremendous dedication as they worked extremely hard around the clock restoring operations back to normal in only 10 days. Continued implementation and testing of PTC across a growing number of routes in our network also negatively impacted velocity during the quarter. Terminal dwell increased 7% compared to last year. Whereas the effect of the hurricane did contribute to the increase during the quarter, we also see opportunities to improve car connections within our transportation plan. Looking at our resources, all in, our total operating workforce was down nearly 550 employees in the quarter when compared to last year. Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 800 employees, driven primarily by fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives implemented during our G55 + 0 efforts. While our TE&Y workforce, excluding those in training, declined with volume during the quarter, our overall TE&Y workforce increased as we began to refill the training pipeline. As always, we will continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate. Despite the challenges experienced during the quarter, the team has remained focused on generating solid productivity results. We achieved best ever train size performance in our grain and manifest categories during the third quarter, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of best ever performance in our manifest network. The team also achieved third quarter records in our automotive, intermodal and coal categories. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased 3% during the third quarter. To wrap up, looking forward, we will continue fine tuning our safety strategy to generate positive results year-over-year. And while we have made solid operating productivity gains throughout the year, our progress is far from over. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad creates an excellent customer experience and increases returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 5% versus last year. Positive core price and increased fuel surcharge revenue offset the slight decrease in volumes for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion, up 6% from 2016. This includes the impact from Hurricane Harvey and the one-time expense associated with our workforce reduction plan. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 3% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $151 million, up about $122 million from 2016. This increase includes the impact for both a large land scale and the settlement of a previous litigation matter. Interest expense of $180 million was down 2% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of a lower effective interest rate, offsetting a higher total debt balance. Income tax expense increased 17% to $789 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings and the impact of the Illinois tax rate increase. Net income totaled $1.2 billion, up 6% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce third quarter earnings per share of $1.50. The operating ratio was 62.8%, up 0.7 percentage points from the third quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit had less than 0.5 point negative impact on the operating ratio, and had a neutral impact on earnings per share in the third quarter versus last year. I want to take a minute to recap the one-time items, which we have called out over the past few months. Slide 20 provides a summary of these items, along with the third quarter impact on earnings per share and operating ratio. Above the line, we had the one-time cost associated with our workforce reduction, as well as the negative impact from Hurricane Harvey. Below the line, we had the negative impact of the Illinois state income tax adjustment which was more than offset by the positive impact from the large land sale as well as the litigation settlement. The net impact of all of these items resulted in a $0.06 headwind on our earnings per share and a negative 2.3 points on our operating ratio in the quarter. Turning now to the top line, freight revenue of $5 billion was up 4% versus last year, despite a 1% decrease in volume. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $227 million, up $54 million when compared to 2016, and down slightly versus the second quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was a positive 2%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments, partially offset by decreases in grain carloadings, finished vehicle volumes and chemical movements. Core price was nearly 2% in the quarter continuing the positive trend that we had experienced throughout the year. And as Beth previously mentioned, we are still facing some challenges with our coal and intermodal businesses. Excluding coal and intermodal, our core price was about 3%. For the full year, we continue to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation costs. Turning now to operating expense, slide 22 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 9% versus 2016, including the impact from the workforce reduction plan which represented a majority of this increase. Excluding the workforce reduction impact, comp and benefits expense was up about 2% versus last year. We expect full year labor inflation to be in the 4% to 5% range. Productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce resulted in total workforce levels declining just under 2% in the quarter versus last year or about 700 employees. This does not include the impact of our workforce reduction plan, which will be reflected in our fourth quarter results. Fuel expense totaled $450 million, up 15% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 2% increase in gross ton-miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1% while our average fuel price increased 13% to $1.77 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $615 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher freight car expense associated with lease turnbacks, subsidiary contract services and hurricane-related costs. Turning to slide 23, depreciation expense was $528 million, up 3% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we now estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 3% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable base, including our Positive Train Control assets that we put in place to date. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $275 million in the quarter, which is down 2% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $230 million, down 15% versus last year. The primary drivers were lower state and local taxes and an easier comparison in bad debt expense, given the Hanjin bankruptcy writeoff in 2016. For the full year 2017, we would expect other expense to decrease about 5% versus 2016. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters of the year totaled about $5.4 billion, down 1% compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit in 2017 compared to 2016, which was mostly offset by the increase in net income. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $19.4 billion at quarter end, up $1.6 billion since the start of the year. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, which is close to our target ratio of just under 2 times. Dividend payments for the first three quarters totaled nearly $1.5 billion, up from almost $1.4 billion last year. In addition to dividends, we also bought back 27.1 million shares totaling $2.9 billion through the end of the third quarter. This represents a 34% increase over last year in terms of dollars spent. Of the 27.1 million shares repurchased year-to-date, we bought back 11.8 million of these shares, totaling about $1.3 billion in the third quarter. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 32% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $4.4 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year, which represented 127% of net income over the same period. On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $70 million of productivity in the quarter. While this number is light relative to the first half of the year, indirect effects related to the hurricane and its impact on overall network operations likely overshadowed some additional productivity momentum. This brings our year-to-date total through the first three quarters to around $270 million. And with these results, we continue to progress as expected, and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million productivity goal for the full year. Looking forward to the balance of the year, we expect fourth quarter carloadings will increase slightly year-over-year, and we still expect full year carloading growth to be up in the low single digit range. With positive full year volume, positive core price, and significant productivity benefits, we are still on track to improve our full year operating ratio, including the net impact of all the one-time items that I just mentioned. We are intently focusing on achieving a targeted 60%, plus or minus, operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives. Before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to mention two other items. One, I would like to announce that we will be hosting an investor day on May 31, 2018, in Omaha, Nebraska. More details to follow, but we look forward to seeing you all here in Omaha next May. And finally, as you all know, Mary Jones has announced her retirement effective December 1. She is sitting right next to me right now. And we would like to thank her for her 37 years of service, including a record 18 years as Treasurer. So thank you, Mary. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Rob, and thank you, Mary. That was a great tribute. Closing out, for the last few months of the year, we expect our business to be similar to this past quarter, with year-over-year challenges in coal and automotive somewhat offset by strength in other areas such as industrial products. As the economy continues to ebb and flow, we will focus on executing our value strategy. We'll use innovation to enhance our customer experience, while continuing to drive resource productivity throughout the organization as we progress our G55 + 0 initiatives. Looking ahead to 2018, our engaged team is laser focused on building on our recent success. Our goal is to continue creating long-term enterprise value for all four of our stakeholders as we improve our top line and progress toward our margin improvement targets. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, please ask one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, great. Thanks for taking the call. I wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the pricing environment and as you look out into probably not the fourth quarter, but maybe 2018, just get a rough sense of maybe how you're starting to think about it as you're having discussions with customers. It looks like you had some acceleration on the core number this quarter and last quarter. How should we be thinking about just roughly the sort of pricing environment as we move into next year? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Beth. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Chris, we are optimistic that the trucking tightening that we're seeing right now and what may come with the ELD implementation is going to provide an environment where we'll have an opportunity for pricing as well as some volume growth. But at the same time, we still do see that other things that will impact us will be other competitive modes of transportation, what's going on with economic demand, et cetera. As you know, we're still very committed to ensuring that we have pricing in place that offsets our inflation. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And with the backdrop that we're seeing with economic growth maybe picking up a little bit, we have some tightness. I guess, coupled with the moves you've done with some head count reductions, any sense of how we should be thinking about productivity? I know you need to get productivity every year in order to get to your longer term OR targets, but how should we be thinking about 2018 maybe in relation to 2017? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, we'll let Rob take that. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Chris, as you know, as part of our G55 + 0 initiative, we're all about continuing to drive robust productivity numbers as we have this year and as we have the last several years. So without giving you a number, I would just say that the unrelenting focus on continuing to drive productivity is embedded in our organization. And as we've always said, we do find benefit in our productivity initiatives with positive volume growth. And at this point in time, we are believing and hoping that the volume for 2018 will be on the positive side of the ledger. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. We would love to see some growth to help us leverage. But in the absence of it, we'll continue to generate productivity. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, operator. And Mary, congratulations, this will be your last call that you'll have to deal with guys like me. Wanted to focus a little bit on the OR in the quarter. Rob, I think you mentioned some of the puts and takes from fuel being about 0.5% (sic) [0.5 point] (27:09) you said, and I think with the other stuff, it looks like if we would draw everything out, you guys are probably closer to a 60% OR. And Lance, I think you describe the fourth quarter as looking very similar to the third quarter. Did I get all those puts and takes right for looking forward? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So I'll start with fourth quarter looking like third quarter. That was largely right. You take the unusual items out, we expect continued robust productivity. We talked about slightly positive volumes. And so the environment, as we see the fourth quarter, looks about like the third quarter. Rob, you want to talk about... Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Jason, I would just say you're right in terms of the way you were doing the math. Fuel was a headwind in the quarter of about 0.3 point and the items that I itemized were 2.3 points of headwind. That's the force reduction in the hurricane impact, which we certainly don't think those two are going to repeat. So if you do that math, you get down to a low 60% core performance, which we're very proud of in the third quarter. Now, I wouldn't straightline because fourth quarters are always little bit different. You got different mix, you got different volume. But I would just tell you, we're continuing to be focused on the same initiatives that drove what we think is an outstanding performance in the third quarter to repeat in the fourth quarter. But I wouldn't straightline any of those numbers, per se. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Follow-up I guess is going to be a little bit about the pricing side. The way I look at it, is obviously, you've had pressures in two of your bigger commodity groups, but it looks like one commodity group should at least start to get better here, let's say, in the next quarter or so. Is the way to think about it as more of a slow recovery in both those two groups, one of which is going to be just driven by what's going on in the truck market. And if that's correct, when do you think you'll start seeing the positive impacts from that? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: So I'm assuming the two groups you're referencing are coal and intermodal, which we called out. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's correct. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: And certainly coal is more of a rail-to-rail competition than truck. There's not as much truck activity in that segment. And so we'll continue to price into that environment, ensuring that we're reinvestable and getting the kind of returns that we want. On the intermodal side, I agree with your assessment. There's lots of different competitors in that space, trucks and rail, IMCs, et cetera, and the tightening of trucks should provide a tailwind, but we are also continuing to keep an eye on what's happening with our competitors in that market space. And at this point, we're pretty hopeful that we're going to see the ability to get additional pricing and volume. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for the time, as always. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Sorry, I just kind of jumped over to the call here, so I've missed some things, I think. But how would you view, I guess, the volume impact looking into next year as you've got \u2013 the economy feels pretty good, you've got a number of probably kind of puts and takes in terms of maybe frac sand coal, things that could be headwinds. But are you optimistic looking into 2018 that you can see, I don't know, meaningful volume growth, call it, 2% type of volume growth, or do you think that there's some headwinds that are going to make that maybe difficult to achieve? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Hey, Tom. This is Lance. I'll start by kind of sharing our overall perspective and then let Beth fill in some blanks. So overall as we look into 2018, we are somewhat optimistic, right? There's a number of markers that look promising. One is the truck market; it is becoming kind of consensus knowledge that truck capacity might very well tighten, the ELD will have an impact of some kind, and that's a good environment. That's good for us when that occurs. It feels to us like the overall economy continues to move along. I'd like to see it accelerate a bit. But consumers feel, to us, like they are buying stuff at a reasonable pace not a kind of a pre-recession normal pace yet. I think that'll show up in housing starts. So there's a number of relatively positive things. There's some continued headwinds, though, as well, right? Coal remains somewhat of a question mark. What exactly happens in the grain markets, and the worldwide feed and grain markets are still somewhat of a question mark. And of course we continue to face a robust competitive environment, notwithstanding that that environment, at its base level, looks like it's improving. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: If you want to talk a little bit more specifically about a few markets we're pretty excited about, we continue to feel good about our ability to grow the new Cold Connect platform that we have, focused on food and refrigerated products. Mexico remains a great opportunity for us. There's certainly uncertainty around what happens with NAFTA, but we believe that market is a growth opportunity for us across a variety of submarkets. And, of course, the plastics expansions will give us some opportunities in 2018 and beyond. Frac sand, as you called out, may have some headwinds, but we view it as there's more than one place that oil is being drilled for in the United States and certainly in the Permian, you're going to see some in-basin sand come online, but we do view the entire pie for frac sand as growing. And we think that we have opportunities in other places like the Eagle Ford and Oklahoma, possibly in the Front Range as well for frac sand shipments. So I think we feel pretty good about some potential there. And if we see housing really go up, that would be a great opportunity for us. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : So, I mean, if you put it \u2013 without saying, oh, it's going to \u2013 volumes are going to grow at a certain level, when you put the puts and takes together, do you say, yeah, we got to get to volume growth next year, and maybe it's a couple points, maybe it's plus or minus, but is it reasonable to think you put them all together, it's more positive than negative? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Tom, this is Rob. As you know, we're not going to give precise numbers around what that volume all adds up to, but we are confident that you add up everything that Lance and Beth just went through, it's going to be on the positive side of the ledger. So we'll work to be as successful in that as we positively can, but I would just reiterate all the things we just said are a fabulous commercial for the wonderful diversity that we have in our network and the strength that that offers us. So we have lots of opportunities to grow our business. And at this point in time, it all adds up to a positive volume assumption. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just one quick one, and I apologize if you mentioned this, but how much of your book would you touch in terms of repricing in 2018, what percent? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: We're kind of typically in around a two-thirds under contract or under letter quote environment with more of a one-third that's quoting on either a spot basis or a tariff basis. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : So the letter quote would be one year, presumably? Do you know how much per letter? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, sorry. I should have been clearer about that. Yeah. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : How much (35:13) Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Those have the potential to roll off sometime in the year next year. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right, so how much would the letter quote be? Is that like (35:20) Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: We're not going to get into those details, Tom. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. It sounds like you've got a lot of the book you could touch next year, so all right. Great. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. And good morning. So historically, we've always heard a lot from the rails about the addressable market for highway conversions as it relates to the intermodal business, but given the tightness we've seen in truckload, I was just curious if you could speak to what the opportunity looks like within your general merchandise network. Is there any way to frame up that addressable market or growth potential that you see from highway conversions in general merchandise? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, thanks Justin. This is Lance. Taking at a very high level, historically, and we still believe this, we've talked about a very large addressable truck market. Our current product today takes us comfortably down into a market where, if the length of haul is 500 miles-plus, it's an opportunity for us. And there's lots and lots of truckload capability there. What we're focused on is making sure that the experience with us in that journey of shipping product feels as good, if not better, than it feels all along the way with truck. I'll let Beth talk more specifically to the opportunities within that market. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, so we do believe that the intermodal market, and possibly even conversion into boxcar off the highway is a big opportunity for us, and our focus is really on taking advantage of our great franchise where we offer intermodal service in many more lanes than our direct competitor, which we think gives us opportunities to grow at a decent pace as the market turns our way with truck capacity tightening. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And as a follow-up and maybe this one is for you, Beth. I think there's going to be a lot more focus on the chemicals business as we get into next year, could you help us think about the potential growth in your chemicals franchise as we get into 2018 and beyond? And do you think we'll be at a point where that chemicals business can start growing at a pace that's above GDP? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: So there are, as you know, close to $200 billion that have been put into the Gulf Coast chemical franchise to grow mostly plastics, although there are industrial chemicals investments happening as well. And while that is a very substantial investment and a wonderful opportunity for us, it certainly isn't the size of some of our other markets. We would hope to see growth in those markets in the tens of thousands of carloads, not in the hundreds of thousands of carloads. And some of the things that'll be a governor for us is not all of that plastics in particular is going to want to move domestically. A lot of it will have an export solution. A lot of it will go out of the Port of Houston, but we will do our best to participate in providing our customers with supply chain solutions, should they not be able to use the Port of Houston because of capacity constraints and want to use a West Coast port where we've developed an opportunity to do that near our Dallas Intermodal facility. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: The good news is \u2013 and Rob talked about this \u2013 our franchise is built for the long run and overall global economic growth for the long run. So you get that beautiful chemical franchise on the Gulf Coast and it'll start out producing and shipping at certain quantity and certain direction, but really, who can make the call over the course of the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, other than we're pretty confident consumption is going to increase worldwide and we've got a wonderful franchise to be able to ship it. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Makes sense. Thanks for the time this morning. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. Fadi Chamoun - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Thank you. Good morning. So if we were to think about volume being up, say, 2% next year, how should we think about the head count? I mean, if you're sort of aiming to that kind of 60-ish percent operating ratio in 2019, I would think head count would have to stay kind of flat or even down a little bit to get you to that number. I'm just trying to reconcile a little bit this sort of 2019 target with the outlook for the head count. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Fadi, without getting into the details, we've outlined the moving parts this morning, so we're going to have pretty substantial reduction in our general and administrative overhead, which we've already talked about. Then as we look at how we react to volume, it's the moving pieces of what we can do on productivity, so that we're not growing our head count one-to-one with volume growth. That's our intent year-over-year, it's what we've been able to do and we're going to continue to do that next year. Fadi Chamoun - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on some of the pricing questions. Earlier in the prepared remarks you talked about the fact that you're still seeing some pressure in intermodal and coal, but just given that the core pricing gains have accelerated for two consecutive quarters, is it fair to infer that some of these pressures that you've been facing have begun to ease a little bit? And if yes, maybe if you can talk about what might be driving that. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: We have maybe seen a little bit of easing in the competitive pressure, but it's not substantial. We're still \u2013 I would say that we're getting good pricing, and I think Rob referenced that, outside of those two markets. That's more like a 3%, so that's helping us to continue to put up good pricing numbers. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up question, one of your competitors discussed expectations for rail inflation for 2018 and cited something around 1.9%. Is that how you're looking at it as well? And maybe you could just share your view about that. And, Rob, I know you mentioned the labor inflation of 4% to 5% this year, but could you remind us what the expectation for all-in inflation is for 2017? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Allison, this year \u2013 you're exactly right, this year, we've said that all-in inflation's around 3%, with labor, 4% to 5%. As we look to next year, we haven't finalized our numbers yet, but I would say both are going to look closer to 2%... Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: All-in and labor. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Lance, I guess I wanted to follow up off of Tom's question about the volume outlook in 2018, and it's really not prescriptive for guidance next year. But when you think about your franchise and we think about railroads in North America, there's clear examples of networks that can drive a lot of growth. It does seem to be a robust economy, both from an intermodal and industrial energy perspective. So I guess as I look back at your slides at your last analyst meeting, there's always this modest volume outlook. Is there anything structurally you can do on the network that can really leverage this low-cost base and really, the irreplaceable assets that you have that can drive a faster growth outlook looking forward? Or are you guys really just capped with the ebbs and flows of GDP? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks for the question, Brandon. I'll start backwards and go forwards in the question. We are not capped as either an industrial production growth rate, a GDP growth rate. When you think about our ability to grow, we're not behaving in a vacuum. So part of the equation is how our franchise lays what's happening in the underlying economies that we serve. So fundamentally, our growth is built on global trade, industrial production, the industrial economy, and U.S. consumption of stuff. And in that context, then, we face competition, either modal competition or direct rail competition. So when I build that model in my mind, when I'm setting my own expectations, I feel pretty optimistic about how our network lands on areas of potential growth. We serve Mexico; we enjoy virtually 70% of the to and from freight rail business with Mexico. Virtually 40% of our business is originated or terminated outside the United States. We serve very large population and growing population centers in the western two-thirds of the United States. And we touch a lot of different pieces of the economy. So from a potential perspective, I feel pretty good about it. After that, it's all about can we find a business that's reinvestable and secure it in the competitive environment. And that's always a wild card and we're always positioning ourselves to be the high value, best option with our customers, and we're going to continue to do that. But to your point, Brandon, nothing would please me more than to see a really strong, robust growth environment because we know how to leverage that very, very effectively. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. And Beth, I just wanted to circle back to your international intermodal comments. It does seem like we're seeing peak ocean volumes right now, so can you walk us through again why you guys aren't seeing a lot of that expansion? I think it's because you've seen port shifts with the carrier consolidation, but could we talk through that again? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: I would say I believe we are seeing the volume. Last year we still had some Hanjin loads which, of course, they went away and their volume kind of dispersed across the other carriers. So if you took the Hanjin impact out, where we are sitting at a 1%, but if you took that Hanjin out of the comparison, we'd be at 5%, which is pretty commensurate with what's actually happening in the market. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much and good morning. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: I wanted to ask one on productivity. The train length question gets asked a lot, but you've also had pretty good gains in terminal productivity year-to-date. Just wondering if you can give us some color on what's driving that? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Cameron? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Inside our terminals, volume remains very predictable and very stable, and that allows you to really bear down on the productivity inside each and every terminal. So that looks very positive as you think about the year 2018. The only area of growth that we see where we might struggle a little bit is out in West Texas, as Beth mentioned. The rest of the network looks very positive. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: And then just separately, I appreciate this is low value traffic, but just curious whether China's pending restrictions on scrap are having an impact on international intermodal in so far as they reduce the potential source of back haul traffic? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, it is \u2013 scrap paper is a portion of the back haul traffic and it is, I'd call it, a mild concern. We are pretty actively looking for other match-back opportunities and we've implemented some programs with our customers to \u2013 and with the steamship lines to use their containers for domestic loads in places where we might not have domestic containers, which doesn't give them a match-back all the way to China, but it might give them a match-back to the West Coast. So we're pretty focused on helping them fill that gap and being good partners in that regard. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Cherilyn, that's something we don't talk a lot about but that's a manifestation of \u2013 kind of a granular manifestation of the value of having the franchise that we do is that we have a lot of exposure to match-back opportunities for West Coast exports, and that can be a real value-add for our international steamship partners. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thank you. That's all for me. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for the taking the time. I wanted to ask you a question about the domestic intermodal market and what you guys can maybe do to help capitalize on that conversion opportunity, because the volume growth, on a reported basis, for intermodal has always been a little bit lighter. You guys have done a great job taking up yields. I'm just wondering as you think about how you work with your channel partners, how you manage the two box pools that you have, how you take that intermodal product to market through streamline. Is there something you can do that you can sort of accelerate that domestic opportunity? And then as you think about what's happening in the eastern market with one of your partners kind of redesigning maybe some of its intermodal services, if that's going to create some either opportunities of challenges for you. If you could comment on, that'd be great. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, so we continue to be very bullish on the opportunity that intermodal provides domestically for Union Pacific over the long term. And we are unique, as you've described, with our two box programs and the ability to bringing assets to bear and help customers meet their supply chain needs. So we are very focused on \u2013 we're always looking at opportunities to get into new markets, provide new services, provide stronger value proposition to customers, and with that, we work across all the channel partners. We see very strong parcel growth this year. But as you say, the overall domestic has been a little weaker, and that's really been more of a competitive pricing situation. And we are and will continue to be focused on yields. We believe that with the tightening of the truck capacity, that's going to open up some opportunities for us. You said a little bit about the CSX's changes in their intermodal network. At this point, I think they're rationalizing some lanes that are local to them that maybe don't make as much sense for them to stay in. And we're just staying in real close communication to make sure that we preserve the viability of that UMAX product and put it in a position where it can grow as we have opportunities. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Recall, David, that we've got those two branded box programs, one each with each of our good partners in the east, the NS and the CSX, and they are both robust potential growths engines. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe Rob, just thinking about the CapEx, obviously the 3Q numbers probably impacted a little bit by the weather and some idling of work crews. Wanted to get your thoughts on the ability to kind of keep CapEx at a little bit lower level here as some of the growth is in some of the lighter weight traffic areas and you've got some idle capacity from kind of the coal traffic coming off. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, David, I would just say. I assume you're talking about looking forward 2018 (52:00) J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, long-range. Well, yeah (52:02). Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: I mean we constantly, of course, as a matter of process are always in tune to being as disciplined and wise about every capital dollar we spend, and it's based on a very rigorous evaluation of what the expected returns are. But the guidance I would give you is that 15% of revenue spent. I mean, again, as you know, that's not how we build our budget, but that's still the right way to look at it looking forward. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, and then... Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: And one thing, David, I heard you say that I want to make sure we don't leave you with this impression, and that is all the potential growth is happening in areas where we've got excess capacity. We do have excess capacity in parts of our network, but clearly there are other parts like down in Texas where the capacity is much more constrained. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, no, I was just wondering if there was going to be any need to step up a little bit of growth CapEx to pursue the intermodal opportunity broadly, or if you feel like you can kind of work that through the existing capita in both, obviously addressing bottlenecks as they happen. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Rob's got it right from the standpoint of long term, we're comfortable with where we've guided. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning. So I apologize if some of this was addressed, we're bouncing between a couple calls. Hopefully, it can be coordinated better next time. Just for you on sand, what percent of your sand business is going to Permian versus other basins? And then what's the strategy as some of the local stuff comes online, if it's going to come, there's nothing we can do about it, or do you think about changing the pricing on the longer haul stuff to compete with the Permian sand? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Well, I don't think we've ever provided exactly what the percentage is of Permian, but we have a good-sized book of business into the Permian as well as the Eagle Ford, smaller books of business into Oklahoma and the DJ Basin sort of area. And off the top of my head, I couldn't even give you the percentages if I had to. But what I would say is they all provide some growth opportunities. Permian will certainly be challenged by in-basin sand coming on that's of a certain mesh type. We do believe there will be opportunities to continue to bring some of the coarser meshes in from the Wisconsin and Minnesota range and continue to compete in Permian. And I would say the Permian overall pie, I think, is still going to continue to grow even with in-basin sand coming on. So we'll certainly be looking to grow there, but we'll be looking to grow in Eagle Ford, Oklahoma, and Colorado as well. And as far as lowering rates to try to compete with local sand, that's a pretty tough proposition. And I think we're always going to stay very focused on being reinvestable and getting a good yield for the assets that we're employing. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, that makes sense. So if I just heard you right, you think even Permian sand volumes are up next year. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: I think the whole Permian sand consumption is up next year. It remains to be seen how much of that will get filled with local sand versus sand coming in from another location. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Oh, okay. That makes sense. Okay. And then Lance, just in terms of the head count reductions, is that \u2013 I guess I'm surprised that that doesn't take up the productivity target for the year, so maybe just a thought there. But more bigger picture, do you think \u2013 is this one of, hey, there's many things like this we can do or is this, hey, this was one specific opportunity and we did it, but don't think that there's lots more like this? I'm just trying to understand if this was a one and done or one of many. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, so Scott, I'll take your first question about productivity targets. We have not changed our productivity targets. This decrease in our overhauled general and administrative head count is going to be absorbed into those. Our communication with you and our drive amongst ourselves has always been we've set out our marker and we're doing everything in our power to get and accelerate productivity, as well as growth, as well as price, so that we can meet or exceed the markers that we've laid out. And in terms of this particular action, reducing our overall head count by 800 plus or minus in this one action, clearly, I don't think that we're going to be taking that kind of action over and over and over again. Candidly, it's something we'd prefer not to do if we don't need to. But I would say that we have many granular projects inside of Grow to 55 and 0 [G55 + 0] that have anywhere between some relatively small impact to some relatively large impact that we're pursuing. And that will inform how much productivity we build into our plans in 2018 and beyond. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much. So just clarification on the inflation for next year, I know you mentioned labor in there. Can you just break out labor as to what you expect labor inflation to be in 2018? I know you signalled it for Q4, but just wanted to confirm on next year what you were expecting in the labor side. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Walter, I earlier said that \u2013 to the question of inflation, and I was talking about 2018, that we expect overall inflation and overall labor to be closer to 2% versus what they're running this year. And at this point, I'm not going to break out the labor component but, of course, not only do you have wages in there, but you also have the moving part of the health and welfare. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay. But you're not breaking that out for 2018 yet? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Not at this point, no. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just the tax rate is still going to be steady at 37.5%? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, that's a reasonable assumption, yeah. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Right. And then the last one, the other line \u2013 in your other line in operating expenses, it does tend to move around a lot. I know you've got \u2013 your guidance has been kind of \u2013 was up and now it's kind of down, and just wondering whether is that a line item that we should, when we look at our 2018, look at 2017 as an exceptional year in terms of being down, or is this a representative year now that we can build on some normal growth rate in line with your overall inflation going into next year? Just want to make sure, because that's a lumpy line item, whether there was something in 2017 that made it a little bit not necessarily repeatable for next year. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Walter, I'm going to disappoint you, because we're not going to give guidance on that number, not because we're withholding but because there is a lot of moving parts, to your point. And it can and will be lumpy. So stay tuned. But we generally say in the $150-ish million neighborhood is what it's looked like historically for other income. But it can be lumpy. I mean, you have lots of moving parts in there. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Sure. I was referencing your other in the other expenses. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: (59:44) Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: We expect to be lumpy as well, not maybe as lumpy as other income. But we're not going to give guidance on that because you're right, there are a lot of moving parts. But we've typically said in the $200 million range, but I would caution you that it can move up and down with unusual items. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, guys. So wanted to start out on the network fluidity metrics, I think we saw a come couple of those tick up in the quarter, I was hoping you could just delineate what might have been due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey versus what you think in terms of fourth quarter and kind of resumption of positive progress, and how you're seeing kind of network fluidity, not only for your network but also kind of interchanges with other carriers. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Interchanges with other carriers look very fluid across the network, up and down the Mississippi. No issues there. Our own velocity was greatly impacted by Hurricane Harvey. In fact, it's one of the larger events that our network has suffered from a weather perspective. The opportunity looking towards 2018 lies in our train crews becoming more familiar with the PTC technology that we've rolled out, both on the west and the northern region, and we feel that that is something that we can tackle internally. It's not a technology problem, it's our crews becoming more proficient at using the technology. Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch : Okay that's helpful. And then just to switch gears a little bit, obviously, there was the land sale this quarter, was hoping you could maybe discuss that in a little bit more detail and what additional opportunities there might be for additional land sales? Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, we did announce the land sale earlier, but we announced it because of the size of it and wanted to give some perspective on the financial impact. But we're not going to give any details on that specific transaction. But I would just say that we have a sophisticated professional real estate organization, so our selling real estate, when we find an opportunity, is something we continually do. I mean, again, it can be lumpy, as I indicated in the other income question earlier on the call, but I would say that's something our professional real estate folks are always looking at, but it will be lumpy, and we're continuing looking at where there are opportunities, where it's an asset that is no longer needed, long term, for the benefit of the rail. And that's kind of how we approach it. Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch : I'll tell you what, maybe if I could ask a follow-up and just ask it slightly differently. Where are you, when you look at your network, where would you say you are in terms of resource needs versus where you'd like to be? You said some capacity tightness in Texas but maybe some loose capacity, other areas; across your network, where do you feel are you on just general research needs? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So let's just walk you around real quick. The major east-west line from the Pacific Northwest, California, NorCal that runs through Wyoming and on into Chicago; in the Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Chicago areas, we've got a lot of capacity there. It was built up for our coal business, and our coal business is about half of what it used to be. If you're over on the West Coast, West Coast has good solid open capacity. We'd love to use that for more shipments up and down the I-5 and growth in Las Vegas, the SoCal area and Phoenix. When you move over down towards Texas, and let's say north-south between Chicago and Texas, and just next Texas and Louisiana themselves, the north-south routes have good solid capacity availability. We still have capacity in certain routes in Texas and Louisiana, but that's the area where when we're focusing on new capacity, when we're focusing on significant capital spend, it is likely to occur there. Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's great color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier questions on what a tightening truckload market means for UP? And specifically, do your contractual relationships with your key domestic intermodal partners, do they allow you the flexibility to push a bit harder on pricing next year or in tight years, in general, compared to the last few years that have been weaker? Or are those escalators fairly fixed and really predefined on a year-to-year basis? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Beth? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Well, we don't typically give a lot of color on specific contractual arrangements with customers, but I would say that we have opportunities out there, most of the bid process for domestic intermodal happens in the spring time, as you know, as they go out to bid for their whole books with beneficial cargo owners. So if truck capacity remains tight and maybe even tightens with ELD, certainly we would hope to see some opportunity to address pricing in that bid period. And we are very hopeful that our long-term partners are able to get pricing in their markets and that that will flow to us as well. And additionally, we really, really would like to see the volume growth along with it. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. And I think in international intermodal, which it felt like part of your question was towards, that tends to be long-term contracts. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Sorry about that. (01:05:38) Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Understood. So in the domestic business, just to clarify, you should see some benefit in the parts of your business where you own the boxes and control some of the assets, perhaps coincident with the bid season, but some of the longer term contracts, either in international or domestic, may be kind of less flexible to the near-term rise in the market. Is that a fair way to put it or (01:06:04) Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I think that's a very fair characterization. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning and appreciate getting me on the call here. Just a couple of quick ones. Cam, I know you mentioned some of the rollout with PTC have an impact on velocity. Was wondering if you could \u2013 if you have a chance to quantify that, and then also, what sort of milestones you're looking at next. It sounds like you've got a better handle on what you need to do in some of the regions, but are there any other milestones that you're looking at that could be significant, maybe not this year, but perhaps in 2018, getting to going live beyond that? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: The velocity impact is somewhere between half mile an hour and mile an hour right now as we see it, because we have rolled out completely on the west and on the north. The vast majority of that opportunity lies within the training and familiarity of the technology with our crews, so it is something we can address. Ahead of us is the southern region implementation in 2018. We see no issues with meeting all the federal requirements in that year. And we'll continue to problem solve the technology when we run into areas that need a technology patch to solidify the whole PTC system. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Hey, Brian. Giving you a little kind of color on that velocity number that Cam just shared. That's a very loosey-goosey number, right. We try to parse that together as best we can. It's kind of hard to tease that out specifically. Leave it said that it's a real impact and the most important thing that Cameron has in front of him is we believe the impact is all about crew behavior. So in your mind's eye, if you think about this, there's a screen in front of the crew and inside the PTC system, pretty much all it does is warn you when it's thinking you're going to need to take action. So half the time, the screen is flashing at you a warning, and I think human behavior is to not have the screen tell you about a warning. That's a little bit of a design issue that I think the overall industry is going to have to get into, because that drives behavior then to be more cautious than necessary, and that then retards the overall velocity on the system. So it's a pretty complex number of moving parts, it's hard to say exactly what the impact that is. But Cameron's given you a general idea of it is impactful and we've got to route forward to address it. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, so it sounds like it's more user interface and not something in the technology that you've encountered so far. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Totally. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on just cross border activity into Mexico. Obviously, we saw a new agreement between a competitor and the KCS at Laredo, was wondering if you've actually seen any sort of impact on your business through that gateway so far? Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, we continue to grow through that gateway over the long run. We are familiar with all competitive products. And we understand, to our chagrin, we're not going to be able to handle every single carload that is made available to and from Mexico, but we are very pleased with our partners and our products and we're doing everything in our power to profitably grow those products. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for your time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Diane on for Ravi Shanker. Thanks for squeezing us in on the call. Just a question regarding the tentative agreement reached between a group of labor unions and the costs on rails. Can you share your initial thoughts on how that agreement stacks up versus your expectations? And also, on the agreement, it looks like it states a 2.5% to 3% pay increase in 2018 and 2019, so wondering why that differs from the 2% labor inflation that you guys expect next year. Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks for the question, Diane. Not surprisingly, I'm not going to be able to make too many specific comments on either the negotiation or this specific tentative agreement. I will tell you that tentative agreement is in industry with about 60% of the industries collectively bargained employment population, and it is out for ratification, as we speak. Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Do you have a timeline for \u2013 or what is your expected timeline for the ratification? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Well, we don't have a specific timeline for it. All I can tell is you that each committee has to ratify vote, and once that's accomplished, then we can call it a done deal and start implementing. I think that's the detail I can give you. Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : The next is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I joined a little late. Sorry if this question was asked and answered, but wanted to just understand the breakdown between contracted and maybe transactional business next year, especially given the expectation for what truck capacity may do next year. Just specifically, how much of next year's businesses are already contracted and maybe how should we expect if there is any lag between your ability to see core pricing growth for the overall enterprise versus maybe the backdrop of the overall market? Thanks. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, we did get this one earlier and so I'll give you the same answer, which is that we see typically that our business is about two-thirds contracted and then about one-third moving in any particular year. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's easy enough. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Amit. Operator : Thank you. We've come to the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing remarks. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you very much, Rob. For the last few months of the year, we expect our business to be similar to this past quarter, with year-over-year challenges in coal and automotive, somewhat offset by strength in other areas such as industrial products. As the economy continues to ebb and flow, we're going to focus on executing our value strategy. We'll use innovation to enhance our customer experience, while continuing to drive resource productivity throughout the organization as we progress our Grow to 55 and Zero initiatives. As we look ahead to 2018, our engage team is laser focused on building upon our recent success. Operator : Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: And with that, thanks, and we look forward to the next time we have an opportunity to speak with you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Baird Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this the time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available in the Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance Fritz : Good morning, everybody. And welcome to the Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha, are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $7.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 or $9.25 per share. These reported numbers include the previously disclosed adjustments reflecting the impact of corporate tax reform which Rob will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Excluding these adjustments 2017 fourth quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.53 per share. This represents an increase of 5% and 10% respectively when compared to 2016. Total volume increased 1% in the quarter compared to 2016 driven primarily by 17% increase in industrial products and a 5% increase in chemicals. Partially offsetting these volume increases were declines in agricultural products, automotive and coal. Intermodal carloads were flat for the quarter. Overall force levels decreased in the fourth quarter both sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to make meaningful progress on our productivity initiatives. The quarterly adjusted operating ratio came in at 62.6% which was up 0.6 points from the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by an increase in fuel price. I'm pleased with the results the men and women of Union Pacific achieved by focusing on our six-track value strategy. While we have room for improvement in many areas that does not include the dedication and hard work of our employees as they build America. Our team will give you more of the details on the fourth quarter, starting with Beth. Beth Whited : Thank you Lance and good morning. This will be our final reporting on six business groups as we announce during the third quarter. Effective January 1 we will transition reporting to our newly established four business groups agricultural products, energy, industrial and premium. For the fourth quarter our volume was up 1% driven primarily by industrial products and chemicals, we generated positive net core pricing of about one and three quarters percent in the quarter with continued energy in intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges our focus continues to be on achieving core pricing gains that counterbalance inflation and coincide with our value proposition. The increase in volume and 4% improvement and average revenue per car drove a 5% increase in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag products revenue was down 4% on a 7% volume decrease partially offset by 3% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 19% driven by high global supplies and reduced US competitiveness in the world export market. Grain products carloads were down 2% as growth in ethanol exports were offset by reduced mill [ph] shipments to the east. The delayed implementation of the biodiesel tax credit also negatively impacted our oils business. Food and refrigerator volumes were up 2% driven by continued strength in import beer. Growth in refrigerated shipments for frozen fries in Cold Connect. Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter on a 4% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 5% as a result of lower production levels in response to softer vehicle sales high inventories as well as planned outages for model changeovers. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and strong shipments into the Texas market for hurricane replacement. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, down only slightly from fourth quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand minimized the impact of lower overall production levels resulting in a 1% reduction. Chemicals revenue was up 7% for the quarter, on a 5% increase in volume, and 2% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments increased 15% driven by stronger diesel and crude oil shipments coupled with strengthen in propane due to Mexico demand, hurricane recovery and inventory build for seasonal winter demand. Plastics carloads were down 4% due to resin tightness and increased commodity prices as a result of residual impact from Hurricane Harvey. Fertilizer was up 11%, driven by continued strength in potash exports. Coal revenue decreased 5% for the quarter, on a 3% decrease in volume, and 2% decrease in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin was down 2%, while other regions were down 1%. Natural gas prices were down 8% from a year ago driving the decrease in domestic demand. Colorado Utah Loadings benefited from strong export shipments to the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast. Coal stockpiles have been below the five-year average for the majority of the year. Industrial products revenue was up 28%, on a 17% increase in volume, and a 10% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 71% in the quarter, driven by a 100% increase in sand shipments, due to improving well completions and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 20% in the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in waste, as a result of West Coast remediation projects and a 60% increase in military shipments, due to increased deployments and rotations. Intermodal revenue was up 4% on a flat volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per quarter. The domestic market increased 1% driven by strong parcel shipment. International volume was down 2% driven by continued headwinds from industry challenges due to overcapacity and consolidations which resulted in increased transloading and changing vessel ports of call. Going forward we'll be begin to report on our four business groups agricultural products, energy, industrial and premium. For agricultural products we anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports driven by demand from China, Brazil and India. Continued growth in food and refrigerated shipments due to Cold Connect penetration tightening to our capacity, frozen fries expansions and continued strength and import beer. We anticipate continued uncertainty in the grain market as high global supply and unknown weak crop quality potentially affect our ability to participate in the export market. For energy we anticipate continued strength in frac sand with more uncertainty in the second half due to the viability of local sand. As always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. Industrial is expected to remain stable. We anticipate an increase in plastics as new facilities and expansions come online and resin supply increases. In addition we expect to see strength in both rock [ph] and cement markets. For premium, we truck capacity to continue to tighten providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate new products benefiting the supply chain will drive growth. As for automotive the US light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units down 2% from 2017. Production shifts will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand and over the road conversions will present new opportunities for additional parts growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron Scott : Thanks, Beth and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable injury rate was 0.79 slightly higher than the full year record of 0.75 achieved in 2016. Although we continue generating near record safety results, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 3% to 2.94. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 5% versus the 2016 to 2.55, as we continue to reinforce public awareness to community partnerships and public safety campaigns. Moving on to network performance, as reported to the AAR, velocity declined 5% and terminal dwell increased 12% compared to the third quarter of 2016. We're not satisfied with this operating performance. Multiple factors play in the network fluidity and we intently focus every day on improving service from these levels. We also have the resources and capacity needed to make this happen. In addition as I mentioned on our last earnings call implementation and testing a positive trend control across a growing number of routes in our network continues to drive part of the negative impact on velocity. For a quick update on PTC, by year end about 60% of the total wrap miles requiring PTC were fully implemented and operational. The western region has been completed. The northern region is near completion and we're well underway on the southern region. With these new regions come a new set of challenges both from a technological and training perspective. The team is doing an excellent job troubleshooting and building upon the lessons learned from those locations where PTC has been implemented. We will continue working through these challenges as we progress towards the 2018 PTC deadline. Taking a look at our resources, all in our total operating workforce was down more than 200 employees in the quarter when compared to last year. Our TE&Y workforce was up 6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by an increase of approximately 600 employees currently in TE&Y training. This is predominantly a timing issue with the six and nine-month lead time required for new hires who becomes service eligible. We've begun refilling the training pipeline to accommodate our resource needs for the coming year. Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 800 employees driven by a smaller capital program in 2017 and because our G55 and zero initiatives have resulted in greater labor productivity. As always we will continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate. Moving onto productivity, although a decline in our velocity in terminal dwell metric did negatively impact productivity in certain areas. I'm pleased with the progress we experienced driving productivity elsewhere. We achieved best ever train size performance in our grain and manifest train categories during the fourth quarter. Marking the tenth consecutive quarter of best ever performance in our manifest network. The team also achieved fourth quarter records in our automotive and intermodal train categories and with 2017 complete I'm proud to announce that the team achieved four year records in every single train category. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as car switched for employee day increased 1% during the fourth quarter. Turning to our capital investments, in total we invested about $3.1 billion in our 2017 capital program. For 2018, we're targeting around $3.3 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. About 70% of our plan 2018 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace all their assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. Our 2018 capital program also includes about 60 new locomotives which will complete our multi-year purchase commitment. We also plan to invest some additional $160 million in Positive Train Control. On accumulative basis we still expect to spend approximately $2.9 billion on PTC. Additionally we plan to begin construction of new classification yard in Hearne, Texas. This facility will be named Brazos yard and will help support expected volume growth from our customers in the southern region. We will improve service by decreasing car handlings and car cycle times. It will also be the most efficient hump yard in our rail network with the lowest operating cost. Construction is expected to cost approximately $550 million with operations schedule to begin in 2020. To wrap up, looking into 2018 we expect network fluidity to return to normalized levels as we work through PTC implementation and shifting volume growth. We will continue to create productivity opportunities through initiatives, design to increase train length, balance resources and improve assets utilization. With the ultimate goal of enhancing the customer experience and creating value for our shareholders. And we'll continuous driving for positive safety results on a way to an incident-free environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks and good morning. Let's start with the recap of our fourth quarter results. I want to first remind everyone of a couple of non-cash items impacting the fourth quarter and it's full year 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation passed prior to yearend. As we initially disclosed back on January 9, the fourth quarter includes a non-cash reduction in income tax expense resulting primarily from the revaluation of the company's deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21% federal corporate tax rate. After further analysis of the effects of the tax reform, we have revised this estimate upwards to just over $5.9 billion compared to $5.8 billion that we disclosed in our 8-K filing. In addition, we also recognize a non-cash reduction to operating expense of just over $200 million related to income tax adjustments at equity method affiliates. This adjustment is primarily driven by our equity ownership in TTX and is reported in the equipment and other rents line of our income statement. Slide 20 shows our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 reflecting the impact of these items. With that in mind, let's take a look at our core performance in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of the corporate tax reform. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter up 5% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 1% increase in volume with the primary drivers of the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion up 6% from 2016. Operating income totaled $2 billion a 4% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million down $11 million from 2016. Interest expense of $188 million was up 8% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of higher total debt balance partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense decreased 2% to $676 million. Net income totaled $1.2 billion up 5% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.53. The adjusted operating ratio was 62.6% up 0.6% points from the fourth quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.6 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2016. Fuel had a neutral impact on our earnings per share year-over-year. Freight revenue of just under $5.1 billion was up 5% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $293 million up $106 million when compared to 2016 and up $66 million versus the third quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter was a positive 0.5%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand and base chemical shipments partially offset by a decrease in grain carloadings. Core price was about 1.75% in the fourth quarter slightly down from the third quarter. However, if we set coal intermodal aside, our core price was around 2.75% in the quarter. And for the full year as we expected the total dollars that we generated from our pricing actions exceeded our rail inflation cost. Turning now to operating expense, Slide 23 provides a summary of our operating expense for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% to $1.2 billion versus 2016. The increase was driven primarily by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation along with higher volume and partially offset by productivity achieved in the quarter. Full year labor inflation came in at about 4%, while overall inflation was approximately 2.5%. Productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce resulted in total workforce levels declining 1.5% in the fourth quarter versus last year or about 625 employees. For 2018, we expect force levels to adjust with volume especially with respect to TE&Y workforce that Cam just mentioned. But our overall workforce levels will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives as well. Fuel expense totaled $547 million up 27% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and 3% increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate was flat while our average fuel price increased 23% to $2.03 per gallon. Purchase services material expense increased 6% to $585 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher cost associated with subsidiary contract services. Turning to Slide 24, depreciation expense was $532 million up 2% compared to 2016. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base including our positive train control assets. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $276 million in the quarter which is down 1% when compared to 2016. This excludes the equity income tax adjustment of $212 million that I mentioned earlier. Other expenses came in at $239 million up 3% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in state and local taxes and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in personal injury expense. For the full year 2018, we expect other expense to increase around 10% versus 2017 driven in part by the anticipation of higher state property tax expense resulting from the corporate tax reform changes. On the productivity side, our G55 and zero initiatives yielded about $75 million of productivity in the fourth quarter. This brings our full year total to just under $350 million. Slide 26 provides the summary of our 2017 earnings with a full year income statement again excluding the impact of our corporate tax reform. Operating revenue increased about $1.3 billion to $21.2 billion adjusted operating income totaled $7.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2016. And adjusted net income was just over $4.6 billion while adjusted earnings per share were up 14% to a record $5.79 per share. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the full year totaled about $7.2 billion down 4% when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit in 2017 compared to 2016 which was mostly offset by the increase in net income. Our capital spending program in 2017 totaled around $3.1 billion. Adjusted return on investment capital was 13.7% in 2017 up a full point from 2016 driven primarily by higher earnings. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all in adjusted debt balance totaled about $19.5 billion at year end 2017 up $1.6 billion since the end of 2016. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 19 times. Dividend payments for the full year totaled nearly $2 billion up from just under $1.9 billion in 2016. This includes a 10% increase in our declared dividend per share which occurred in the fourth quarter. In addition to dividends, we also bought back 36.4 million totaling $4 billion during the full year 2017. This represents 29% increase over 2016 in terms of dollar spent. In the fourth quarter we bought back 9.2 million shares at a cost of about $1.1 billion. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 32% of our outstanding shares. And between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned $6 billion to our shareholders in 2017, which represented 129% of adjusted net income over the same period. I want to provide you some commentary on how we believe the new tax law changes will impact Union Pacific in 2018 and beyond. Our federal statutory income tax rate will decline from 35% to 21% all in when you include state taxes, our effective income tax rate will be about 25% and from a cash perspective we expect our 2018 cash tax rate to be between 17% and 18%. This cash tax rate reflects the benefits from the lower federal tax rate and immediate expensing of eligible capital expenditures partially offset by the negative impact of prior year bonus depreciation programs. In later years, our cash tax rate will likely trend in the direction of the statutory rate. We expect these changes will result in free cash flow by approximately $1 billion in 2018 and we're still in the process of developing specific plans for the uses of cash in 2018 and as you know these plans including our capital budget must be reviewed and approved by our board. But for now, I can assure you that our basic philosophies and priorities regarding cash allocation and distribution have not fundamentally changed. We will continue to employee a balanced approach to capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. First and foremost, we will approximately invest in the business with an eye on earning adequate returns on capital employed. And as Cam mentioned earlier, we plan to spend around $3.3 billion in capital in 2018 and our guidance of reinvesting around 15% of revenue remains unchanged. At this time, after capital expenditures we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead to 2018 from a fundamentals perspective. We expect volumes in the first quarter and the full year to be up in the low single-digit range. And as Beth commented on earlier, we should see strength in several business categories along with uncertainty in other areas. We will price our service product to the value that it represents in the market place from an all in pricing perspective we're confident the dollars we generate from our pricing initiatives should well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2018. As for inflation this year, we expect both labor inflation and overall inflation will be under 2% driven primarily by lower expected health and welfare costs. On the productivity side, we plan to achieve approximately $300 million to $350 million of savings this year as we continue to focus on G55 and zero initiatives. To wrap it all up, in addition to the significant incremental cash benefit that we expect as a result of the corporate tax reform. Positive full year volume, positive core price and a significant productivity benefits will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation in an improved full year operating ratio in 2018. We're still focused on our targeted 60% operating ratio plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019 and we're confident in our plans to get there. In longer term, we're firmly committed to reaching our goal over 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue to momentum of our volume pricing and productivity initiatives. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you Rob. As we discussed today we delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results setting the table for 2018. We're optimistic the economy will favor a number of our market segments leading to another year of positive volume growth. Increased unit volume combined with inflation plus core pricing and G55 and zero productivity initiatives should result in another year of revenue growth and improved margins. We'll continue to execute our value track strategy to benefit our employees, partner with the communities we serve, provide our customers with an excellent experience and generate strong returns for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Van Kegel : This is actually Van Kegel on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Lance, Beth could you just kind of give us post mortem on 2017. Your volume was up around 2% versus the industry up about 4% and your competitor being up 5% and historically UNP haven't seen a lot of growth. Could you just talk through some of the headwinds that maybe we don't appreciate from this year and some of the most compelling market opportunities going forward? Lance Fritz : Sure, Van this is Lance. I'll start with just a very broad overview of 2017 and then turn it over to Beth for more specific market discussion. So you're right, we had about 2% volume growth. You combine that with core pricing growth and are about $350 million in productivity and it generates a record EPS of $5.79 now within that. there are some things that we're particularly proud of that is continued productivity improvement, the ability to get price in some of our markets that are relatively difficult having a franchise that makes us open and accessing to number of markets that are looking pretty sharp and good. And then there are some things that I would say I'm either not happy with or disappointed in and that is, in the second half of the year. We saw our operating kind of service product and overall operating performance slip a bit and that's a place that we're not comfortable in and we're working very hard to remedy as we speak. Beth? Beth Whited : Lance mentioned we're very focused on ensuring that we're generating great value and margins for the company and we're maybe less focused on volume as we end and all be all, so we had great growth, wonderful business that we enjoy in frac sand. We saw coal return in the year overall to levels that are probably a little bit more normalized. We had really strong Ag in the first half not so much in the second half compared to the year before and that's really just a global markets perspective and then on the intermodal side, while our domestic parcel business went gangbusters, we continue to see competitive pricing scenarios in both international and domestic intermodal for most of the year that really dampened our growth potential compared to others. We remained really focused on improving margins in intermodal and so we didn't see maybe the same kind of growth that you saw from others. Van Kegel : Great. And then on just quick follow-up on intermodal. I mean domestic up on and international on two and kind of wanted to strongest global trade environment we're seeing. Could you just give some more context around the drivers behind that and maybe either contract loses or some of the shifts that happen with the streamliners and then what you're doing on the sales and marketing side to maybe improve those outcomes. Thank you. Beth Whited : So as I mentioned we were - we had really strong parcel growth in the last quarter, a lot of that ecommerce driven as you would expect. The domestic market seems to be significantly improving with the tightening of truck availability so I would - we're certainly very hopeful that ends up being a good market for us in 2018, on the international side. We did see some decline in the fourth quarter and I think that is largely due to some shifting from the Pacific Northwest US ports into some of the Canadian ports where you've seen some pretty significant capacity expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : So wanted to ask you Rob about just the pricing metric. I think people surprised that it decelerated this quarter even if you exclude coal intermodal decelerated a little bit. So maybe if you can give us some thoughts on why it decelerated. Beth, I think last quarter you said that the coal intermodal competitive pressure maybe starting to ease a little bit and maybe if you can give us an update there. And then Rob, you talked about inflation - pricing dollars well exceeding in inflation so I think that sounds a little bit better than what you've been saying in the past. Maybe do you have, is that just the inflation dollar amount slowing a lot or do you have confidence that the pricing dollars accelerates this year. Rob Knight : Yes, Scott let me take all that in. first of all you noticed that we changed the refind [ph] if you will and I would say being crystal clear and trying to be as transparent as we possibly can the rounding convention to quarter points here. I would say that if you look at the difference between the just under two, that we reported in our pricing in the third quarter to the 1.75 that we're calling out here in the fourth quarter the difference between the third and fourth quarter is really quite small. So I wouldn't read that there is any pricing actions story to be told between the third and fourth quarter there. Stepping back though, just to remind you and I know you, you know this but to remind everybody listening. How we calculate price? And we've been doing this for the 15 years that I've been the CFO and I'm very proud of this. It's a very detailed, analytical approach to what did we actually yield from our pricing action. So it's not representative of same store sales that took place this quarter versus last quarter or last year. it really is how many dollars did we yield from the pricing actions that we took since the last 12 months and how many dollars did we yield this quarter that actually went to the bottom line, so it's not again it's not a same store sales type, remember what we did really take to the bottom line and in the fourth quarter that was 1.75 pricing. To your point, if you exclude as we called out in both the third quarter and now in the fourth quarter. If you exclude the coal intermodal where we continue to face some challenges I would say and Beth can perhaps elaborate on the intermodal piece of this. I would say that in the fourth quarter we still face those same challenges. Now as you look forward and Beth can comment on this, as you look forward particularly in the intermodal we're feeling better about that obviously but we're still in the competitive challenges I would say in the coal space and then there is one final comment before I let Beth comment on the intermodal on your question about the well exceeding comment that I made as we look to 2018 and what I'm saying there, is our expectation again remember how we calculate price, it's dollars yielded from the pricing actions that we took and comparing that to the dollars we anticipate expending on inflation, both pieces we think are moving favorably, yes we think inflation overall for 2018 will be lower than 2017, we think it's going overall be under 2% and yes, we do have some optimism as we look forward to 2018 in some of our pricing opportunity. So we believe that gap if you will of the pricing actions and yields from our pricing actions in 2018 versus the inflation dollars will be better in 2018, than it was in 2017. Beth Whited : Yes, just building on what Rob said. My perspective is that, our pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter was not different. We were still seeing opportunities to price and I would say growing opportunities to price on the domestic intermodal side, international intermodal and coal continue to be challenges for us competitively, but we definitely do see that truck availability is tightening in the spot market, how that converts into long-term contracts we'll get more and more opportunity to see as we have bid season coming up in domestic intermodal, but it does feel like the pricing opportunities are flowing. Scott Group : Okay, that's helpful and then Rob, I wanted to just ask you what about just the balance sheet and maybe the rationale for being a single A credit. It doesn't seem like there is any sort of meaningful reduction you're seeing in borrowing cost relative to maybe some of the other rail so, so it doesn't just feel like we're optimizing that the cap structure here and now with all the extra cash flow from tax reform. It would seem to be like there is a pretty dramatic opportunity here to ramp up leverage and then obviously would that really ramp up the buybacks for your shareholders. I know you can't give us like the specific numbers today and maybe that will come in May, but maybe can you just because what I'm saying makes sense to you or is there a reason why you feel like you need to be a single A credit relative to what you used to be. Rob Knight : Scott, duly noted. We totally understand your point and others point on this very issue. I would say that, with the new $1 billion of cash flow opportunity we have, it's frankly high class problem for us to evaluate how this is all going to play out. I know we and everyone including rating agencies are going to be digesting what does all this mean. We're comfortable being we drive towards cash flow measures and we've been comfortable with A rating, but even within that Scott to your point, we think there is a growing opportunity for us to both grow our cash flow from the fundamentals and the benefits of the tax reform act give us additional opportunities and as I stated. I'll reiterate it. We're not changing our philosophy we're going to contuse to be very focused on rewarding our shareholders in addition to spending capital, where the returns are there but we do believe this gives us a high class problem as we look at dividend and share repurchases going forward. Scott Group : Okay, all right. Thank you guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Rob, you've been at between 63%, 64% OR for four years now and you noted the workforce that was in your commentary will increase with volumes. Is that a change from growing the workforce but not at a pace with volumes and I guess just thinking about 60% OR does that include the shift in pension income and with the rise in the fuel prices impacting the operating ratio. Rob Knight : Yes Ken I mean your point is duly noted in terms of where we are and we're proud that we've, as you know over the years going from high 80s to the low 60s and we're very focused on getting that 60 and ultimately 55. The math behind why it may have kind of slowed the momentum here in the last couple of years is a lot of moving parts in there. But rest assured, we're very focused on continuing to improve year-over-year and we have to drive incremental margins to get to that 60 plus or minus by 2019. And what it's going to take continue focus on our G55 and zero initiatives which still is turning out stellar productivity numbers. High quality service product enables us to continue to get price in the marketplace. Specifically to your point on headcount that's not really a change. What I said here today on headcount and that is that, it will move with volume but not one for one that is not a change we've kind of had that philosophy now for several years and what I'm saying there, is if volume is up x% I would expect that will require us because we think we're right-sized right now that will require us to bring in additional employees depending on what business it is, what makes it etc., but it's not going to one-to-one because the G55 and zero focus on productivity, we're very confident that headcount will not grow at the same pace that hopefully volume does. So it's really a combination of factors, but I take comfort that we're very focused and committed to continue to drive to that 60 plus or minus by 2019. Lance Fritz : Ken, this is Lance just two other observations. One is that training pipeline is going to have to be filled just for attrition purposes. We have what mid to high single-digit percent attrition out of TE&Y workforce every year, so that's going to have to be filled for that purpose. As we look forward into next year in growth. The second thing is, growth is another levers that we focus on in making sure that we're able to drive long-term margin improvement and we're very pleased that we got margin improvement this year. Ken Hoexter : Okay, great thanks. Rob I think I was little confused I thought you were shifting and saying that you're going to one-for-one in the original computation. Thanks for that clarification. Rob Knight : Thank you for the clarification, no I'm not saying that. Ken Hoexter : And then my second one, I guess Lance maybe for you the - we've heard now three other rails move to kind of eliminate it seems like almost all of their hump yards and improved operating performance. Now you're looking to spend maybe $500 million on adding another one. Maybe can you just walk through the cost benefit analysis so we can understand the difference of why you looked to add, when other seem to cutting them. Lance Fritz : Yes, absolutely so let's start from the top. Ken, right we use yards whether it's flat switching yards or hump yards to categorize cars in our manifest network and you know we have a very robust large manifest network. When we determined how we want to get that switching done it's all about how many cars can we aggregate and how deep into the network or somebody else's network we can send them that informs for us. The number of large network yards which are hump yards for us that's all driven by car count versus smaller, regional or local yards which are flat switching yards. The reason why we're building a new hump yard in the middle of Texas is that as we look forward both from the volume that's coming out of the petrochemical complexes along the Gulf Coast. Texas itself and overall manifest growth down in that part of our network. We see that our existing infrastructure is going to be overwhelmed at some point in the future. We're doing everything we can to incrementally improve productivity in those areas. You saw Cameron this morning talk about incremental productivity and car switch for employee. We also look for incremental capital that can be spent in existing network yards, but once that string runs out, we have built new capacity. When you think about this specific yard, Brazos. It will be the most productive yard on our network. It will be the lowest cost per car switched and the most efficient. And what we will do is, we'll utilize it again for a lot of that two and from business that's down in the Southeast part of our network and we're pretty confident I would scratch that, very confident that now is the right time to build it and it's the right asset to build. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Rob, just real quickly in terms of that 10% growth in the other expense guidance. Could you clarify that a little bit more? It sounds like you guys are doing a lot of work on taking cost to out and yet this other line continues to kind of pop up a little bit. So I'm just wondering kind of what's behind that cost increase there. Rob Knight : Yes, David I mean there's a lot goes into the line item as you know and it includes state and local taxes. The equipment property damage, utilities, insurance I mean environmental. A lot of things going into that so it's one of the hardest if you will to try to nail to the wall is to exactly what that's going to be. Your point is duly noted. On every cost bucket rest assured as part of our G55 and zero initiative though we've got an eye on being as efficient and productive as we can and we got to include the other expense, but our best linking at this point in time largely driven by some of the unknowns around the state and local tax is in that 10% category. David Vernon : Okay and then maybe just you guys have done a phenomenal job in terms of managing upper turns and evaluating new business opportunities based on their reinvestability [ph]. As you think about the lower tax rate sort of maybe changing the math on what is investible, what is not investible. Are there any opportunities where you see you might be able to get a little bit more aggressive in terms of driving some volume growth because of a lower tax rate? Lance Fritz : David this is Lance. The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad. So I think the short answer is, just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us. David Vernon : I mean I guess the one area that's come up in a couple of conversations with some industry folks is the West Coast intermodal freight where obviously the US rail industry is going to be getting a little bit of tax reform benefit that maybe the Canadian rails aren't and you've seen a bunch of freight diversion of north. Would that maybe impact some of the routing decision in some of those moves or is that just something you guys wouldn't even consider. Lance Fritz : Well so those routing decisions right now as we compete for that business right now is all about the service product, the ultimate cost to the end user and which way they want to go, what's most attractive to them. So we compete aggressively for that today. We'll compete aggressively for it tomorrow. In the context of making sure we generate an attractive return outlook. David Vernon : All right. Thanks for your time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. Fadi Chamoun : On the drill back into the productivity little bit. I mean looking back on 2017, we had a pretty good kind of revenue environment you achieved $345 million of productivity savings, the OR moved 50 basis points. So we're starting 2018 with 300 basis point to improve into your target. So 2019, if you can just kind of walk us through what is going to get better in 2018 and 2019 in order to kind of move the productivity momentum stronger and to get you to your target of 60. Lance Fritz : Let me start with that and then I'll let both Rob and maybe Cam add technicolors [ph] appropriate. So Fadi, the game plan really doesn't change as we look forward. The levers continue to be productivity and we've talked about the amount of productivity we think we can get in 2018 and we're just laser focused on delivering that and then moving into 2019 for the same. We see market opportunity for growth and growth is always our friend in terms of leverage and dropping it to the bottom line and then price of course. The thing that gotten away a little bit for even better results from 2017 is that in the second half of the year, the fluidity of the network eroded to a certain degree in some part that's Positive Train Control and the impact of implementing it aggressively across the network you heard those stats. Part of it candidly was just execution in a certain spots around the network that we have all hands on and attention and I'm confident given that we've got the resources and the capacity that will remedy that. So my expectation is 2019, 60 plus or minus operating ratio is still eminently achievable and we have enough in front of us in activity and projects to make it happen. Rob Knight : Fadi I would just add, don't take anything I'm about to say here as excuses, but just recall notably in the third quarter we did have the hurricane impact, we had the force reduction impact, fuel for the full year was a little bit of headwind, so no excuses but some of those things notably the workforce reduction sizable we'll get the benefits of that more in 2018 where we incurred the cost in 2017 and of course things like the hurricane, which frankly we whether extremely well, those are things that we don't anticipate repeating, other than that it really is just a volume productivity and pricing levers that we're going to continue to pull. Fadi Chamoun : Okay, thanks that's helpful and just one follow-up on the pricing side. International intermodal you said that market can remain very competitive, would attribute that competitiveness to the Canadian ports and the Canadian kind of railroads being more aggressive on the market. Was it US competition like? Beth Whited : Fadi, I would say that we see both things being pretty aggressive. It's pretty aggressive coming out as Pacific Southwest in terms of the pricing challenges and it's pretty aggressive coming on Pacific Northwest which is US railroads and Canadian railroads. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : I wanted to come back to the OR for a second just thinking about the fourth quarter and them maybe looking out to 2018. But within the fourth quarter, we know fuel was a headwind but it sounds like ex-fuel kind of OR was flattish. We had positive volume, positive price. Just want to get a sense from a 4Q perspective. If there is anything specific in the quarter going on from a cost standpoint. That you felt like maybe it was maybe a little bit one-time and make sure maybe that's recurring and then as you move into 2018 particularly the first half. I mean did those things kind of, are there other cost item that sort of drop away. Do you think you can get OR improvement in the first half of 2018? Just trying to get a sense of sort of how things are trending today. Lance Fritz : Hi, Chris I'll let Rob speak to the details of the fourth quarter financials. But just at a high level. I think we would have been generating a better operating ratio and overall results with a more fluid network. Again there is a number of reasons for that, that Rob outlined that we've talked about this morning and there is no reason to think that that is systemic is anyway. That's a completely resolvable issue. Rob Knight : Lance the only thing I would add and Chris as you know, we are focused on improving our operating gross here in 2018, we're going to stay away from breaking out by quarter or first half versus second half. But [indiscernible] Lance from my perspective there is nothing really unusual, you called out fuel that occurred in the fourth quarter other than our disappointment on the cost side. I mean we frankly admit that there is opportunities and we are very focused on doing better on that and that's the big delta in my mind. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, all right. And that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just in the context of sort of pricing and it seems like the industry is getting better pricing gradually in 4Q and then moving forward into 2018 with the potential of the much tighter truck market, how much of your business is sort of available and open for repricing. So how much in other words do you think you can kind of capture what's going on in some of those markets, with contracts that are available to be repriced. Beth Whited : I think we've given guidance previously that roughly two-thirds of our business is under some sort of one year or longer term at any given point in time and then you have things that are under, everything else will be kind of under tariff and available for pricing and then you know of course you get roll off the one year deal, so. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, so somewhere in the sort of the third range is kind of what the shot on goal is for 2018, maybe a little bit more than that. Lance Fritz : No, so listen to what Beth was just saying, at a moment in time a third is available through tariffs overtime the other two-thirds a portion of that, maybe a fair portion of that is in short-term contract. So as they expire they become available for pricing. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : I guess just following up on the previous question. If we think about the bid season for trucking and assume that TL contract rates are up in the mid-single digits or high single digits during the bid season. Is it fair to assume that UNP would see a step function increase in price in the second half? Beth Whited : Well as you know, there definitely is a timing of the bid season on the intermodal side in particular and then of course we have other business that's truck competitive as well. so as we go into the bid season in the second quarter, we certainly hope that spot high rates that are happening right now and trucks convert to longer term contract capability, but you're right it won't show up until later in the year. Allison Landry : Okay, all right. And then I know that pricing is been - dead horse during the call, but I wanted to ask about the coal pressure. I know that you mentioned that the pressure was similar in Q4 to what it was in Q3. But if we think about new contracts signed in the second half of the year, was the pressure the same as it was for contracts signed in the first half of the year or was there some sequential easing that happened. Beth Whited : I would say that, we're the pressure in the coal markets remains pretty much the same. Allison Landry : Okay, so from the first half to the second half, it was the same. Beth Whited : Yes. Allison Landry : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : I wanted to focus on few of the CapEx budget items and how they might trend beyond 2018. Specifically the $460 million or so for locomotive equipment that you said this was the last year of your purchase commitment on locomotives. The 160 for PTC since we're at the tail end of that and the 445 that you allotted the capacity investment which seems to be up almost $200 million year-over-year and I'm assuming that's related to the Brazos project that you talked about earlier, but can you just give us sense for how some of those moving parts might move into 2019 and beyond, it would be helpful. Thanks. Rob Knight : I'll probably disappoint you, not getting into quite the level of detail that you're asking and let me just start out by reiterating that our guidance for the long-term is 15% of revenue and as I think you and everyone knows, that's not how we build our capital plan, but that still is a good way of thinking about what we're thinking here as to what the overall expenditures will be when you add it all up. Some of the moving parts so that I will call out. Yes, this is the last year's as Cam pointed out, this is last of our long-term commitment on buying locomotives, so we'll take 60 locomotives this year and we don't have plans at this point in time to take any more locomotives beyond that. We will still have some capital expenditures that go into locomotive programs etc. in there. So the number will come down, but it won't go to zero in our locomotive line PTC. Clearly once that's up and running and behind us that number will change. It will go down to probably not zero in the near term, but it will go down as it has dramatically from where it started and beyond that again, so we just talk about Brazos being an opportunity where we're making an investment because we're confident the returns are there. And that's how we look at all investments, so you're right there is some pieces coming down and other than Brazos we're not saying it's necessarily going to be backfilled dollar for dollar, but our guidance at this point in time to kind of answer your question is still at 15% of revenue look. Bascome Majors : I appreciate that color there. Just one more question someone earlier mentioned that the training pipeline will have to be filled to start to backfill some attrition based on the growth you expect over the next few years. Where is the TE&Y pipeline today and can you help size us how many hirers you might need to get that pick where you like it to be? Lance Fritz : Bascome, I don't know we'll give you exact numbers, but I think Cameron can give you a sense for how we're thinking about it. Cameron Scott : For the attrition that Lance mentioned earlier in the meeting, we have filled the pipeline appropriately to meet that attrition and some of the growth that has been highlighted for the southern region and we feel like that's time to pretty accurately. There will be a few additional hirers filtration in the locomotive and engineering side, but we think we've got that pipeline filled appropriately. Lance Fritz : The operating team and we haven't received any questions about this morning, but it was a pretty start [ph] number. They've done a tremendous job on the engineering and mechanical side of achieving productivity both in central operations and in our distributed operations that are throughout the network and I anticipate there is even more opportunity there as we look into 2018 and beyond. Bascome Majors : Great. Thank you for the time this morning. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Tom Wadewitz : I'll start with one on the cost side. I guess when you talk about inflation I know that probably doesn't map precisely to total operating expense growth, but obviously some broad relationship in the way we model that. you're talking about 2% or less in inflation and on the high side you get the 5% rise depreciation 10% and other expense so, what would be the categories of operating expenses that would be less than 2% and we ought to model at kind of pulling that overall number down to 2% and if I'm thinking about it wrong tell me that, but just want to know where we should model, maybe favorable OpEx items on the P&L. thanks. Rob Knight : Tom, again I'll probably disappoint in terms of giving you the precise line items that you're asking, but I would just start out by saying, every cost bucket we're looking at opportunities to squeeze out efficiency and manage the cost. You've got your comp line, which again I called out that line overall should be less than 2% on the inflation side of the house. You look at rents I mean that's another category where we're hopeful of continuing to manage that effectively, but just and I know you know this. But just to kind of reiterate, when we less than 2% of course we're talking about inflation, the actual cost that flow through the income statement will largely be driven by what volume we actually enjoy and so volume costs albeit not one for one and all the efficiencies that we expect to squeeze out of that will clearly fill up on the line items as well, but as it relates to inflation. I call out I guess comp and rents of two lines that might be lower than overall average. Tom Wadewitz : Okay and then, I know this has been a big topic on the call, but just headroom in pricing as well. how do you think about, like I think about the eastern rails is having more sensitivity to truck market so their pricing is kind probably going to move a little bit more close to the related to the rise in truck. How much of your book do you think is pretty sensitive to truck market, how much do you think that can flow through to help pricing. It seems like the truck markets are super, super tight and that it's kind of hard to resolve your cautious comments on price with that really tight truck market. How do we think about how much sensitivity you have to truck, what parts of the book or how much is the book overall? Beth Whited : We do have several markets that are very truck competitive, intermodal being one of them. Lumber, I think you probably saw the article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that called out Reefer capability as being very tight right now and we participate in that to obviously lower volume for us, but we do have exposure to that and then of course we serve a lot of bulk markets that aren't as likely to be truck competitive. So when we put all that kind of together in the mixer and we think about what's happening there, we do see that there is a potential for us to have the opportunity to participate with some higher pricing in these markets that are truck competitive. The caution I give you is that, we are continuing to see quite a bit of competitive pressure in big books of business like international intermodal and coal. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, so you want to put a number around it, like 20%, 30%, 40%. Beth Whited : Rob will not let me tell you a number. Rob Knight : Various categories, but we're going to stay clear of giving up precise point on that. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, okay. Thanks for the comments. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Well let me drag the horse out again, guys. Let me look at it at a different way, so obviously you're saying modest sequential decline and what you report as core price or essentially the same as the previous quarter. When you look at the contracts that you've signed this year or maybe late last year would those be above that core rate that you posted in the fourth quarter. so something similar to one of your competitors reported north of the border [ph]. Beth Whited : We really don't talk about individual deals when we do this, we have a very purist mentality about how we calculate price. We are looking at the yields and so one thing you might want to think about is, it really kind of depends on what's going on in your book of business, right. So mix can be very important and the fourth quarter we had the virtually the same price as what we got in the third quarter and we had a lot of changes in that mix of business. So it matters in the way that we calculate price. We still feel good about the pricing that we're getting we're going to take advantage of the opportunities we have as these spot truck rates firm we hope into longer term capability to price there. And as I've mentioned like a few times it feels like a bunch, we still see headwinds in some of our big books international, intermodal and coal being two, I would call out for you. Jason Seidl : Your description of firming at least intrigues me to some extent because what we're seeing in the marketplace on the spot side is really strong price increases and a lot of people talking about potential contractual increases, somewhere between 6% and 10% on the truckload side. Are you guys seeing something different because I would categorize at a strong rate increases is not firming, if you will. Lance Fritz : Jason, this is Lance. We would love for the current truck pricing environment to continue all the way through bid season next year as a potential that it does and it's a great environment for us to be out in the market place pursuing business and repricing business. So I think that's probably the sum total of what we want to say about truck pricing. Jason Seidl : My follow-up is on Mexico, could you talk a little bit about the total exposure in terms of traffic direct from you guys and then maybe any interchange as well as, do you feel that there's been any increase in shipping to and from Mexico ahead of any potential issues with NAFTA. Lance Fritz : I'll take that Jason. So our Mexico business is about 11%, maybe a little bit more of our overall book. We enjoy about 70% of that business to and from Mexico that's shipped by rail and we've not seen anybody's behaviour in our served markets changing pending NAFTA. Having brought up NAFTA of course we're keeping a very close eye on current negotiations, you know we're in the penultimate negotiation up in Montreal. So they're down to the really difficult parts of the deal that need to be negotiated and while I still believe there is a good opportunity for the NAFTA agreement to be solidified, all three parties continue in it going forward. We've got a strong eye on all the what if's and contingency plans and agility to react to whatever would happen. Jason Seidl : Okay, that's good color. Listen, everyone I appreciate the time as always. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Russell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Russell : Just going back to the productivity program and particularly in the context of the current cycle. Is there any trade off here where you think you'll capture less of the volume or the pricing upside and the cycle, just given you have this longer term focus on productivity. Lance Fritz : I'll take a stab at that. so when we think about productivity we don't view that as a trade-off for price and volume productivity to a fair degree is in our control and things that we are consuming, paying for, organized for, in order to provide an excellent customer service which allows us to price in the market place. So I don't think we see it as a trade-off like that. Matt Russell : Okay and just to go back to one of your follow-ups to David's question on capital investment. I would think that the return on any project that you were considering on a previous tax reform would previously tax [indiscernible] would improve here tax and cash flow that are low rate, the immediate depreciation. I guess why wouldn't that increase the pool of investments that will be attractive to you and is it just a factor of even after you adjust for those returns, [indiscernible] hurdle rate. Rob Knight : Matt this is Rob. I would say clearly yes, that's a positive tax reform is a positive in that calculus. What we were saying and Lance addressed earlier is that alone is not going to cause us to, it's not like we have a bunch of pent up capital projects that were sitting on the sidelines just waiting for that extra couple of points have been improving on the ROI and by the way I would remind that we're improving or increasing our capital spend in 2018 versus s2017, so it's all in the mix of things but it's not like to ask opening a floodgate of additional investment that was pent up sitting on the sideline. Lance Fritz : Matt, but so let's take a step back and take a little broader perspective of this tax reform. We do believe and we hear from our customers and our markets that tax reform fundamentally makes the United States more competitive both for direct investment whether it's foreign direct investment or domestic investment and for competing it with either import goods or for export goods. So from our perspective we believe the tax reform will result in more opportunity for us over the longer term which should result in more opportunity for us to invest and to grow and to hire. But that's the string that we see happening basically it will affect the competitiveness of the markets that we serve and then that will drive incremental investment opportunity and incremental hiring opportunity. Matt Russell : Makes a lot of sense, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Just one straggler here. There's been a change in Canadian grain regulation that potentially allows US rail to maybe access some of that market. Do you see that as an opportunity for you guys? Beth Whited : The change doesn't impact Union Pacific in particular, we do participate in some of the Canadian grain market that would come across desk from one of the Canadian railroads and go to export, but we don't see that - this change in the regulation materially changing anything for us. Ravi Shanker : Got it and just a follow-up on the frac sand market. You said the second half of the year is likely to be challenging given the emergence of some local alternatives. What's your game plan there? I think you guys can [indiscernible] to kind of make your business more competitive or help make white sand more competitive versus brown sand to kind of help defer that impact. Beth Whited : The reason that the brown sand is really emerging is because the logistics cost are so substantial coming from with constant in Minnesota and while there could be fringe markets that you can help make that worse, it doesn't seem like that's solvable by us. However I do think that there are other markets, other shale plays where white sand is desirable that will continue to emerge, so it's not just the Permian there's Eagle Ford, there's the Oklahoma markets are pretty hot you're seeing investment happening in the DJ Basin and Colorado as well. Lance Fritz : And we're pursuing participation in the local markets to the extent that makes sense as well. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : I wanted to ask about incremental margins as the fourth quarter was lighter than what we've typically seen in this type of environment, was there anything outside of the fluidity issues you've mentioned that drove this and as we look into 2018, what's your confidence incremental margins can return to levels that are 50% plus? Rob Knight : Justin, you're right on I mean as I pointed out earlier. We were not happy with our performance in the fourth quarter on couple of measures and that showed up in the incremental margins, but it was fully explained by some of the fluidity challenges that Lance and Cam addressed earlier. So there is nothing other behind the scenes on that. and as we look to get to our 60 plus or minus by 2019 we've got annually run in 50% to 60% incremental margin range and that's our focus and we understand that and we're confident in our ability to get there. Justin Long : That's helpful and Lance, you mentioned a couple of times earlier that operating performance did flip in the second half and I wanted to ask if you could address when you think the network can get back to normal fluidity this year and what are the specific action items that are necessary to see this recovery. Lance Fritz : Yes, I'll just briefly take a stab at that question and ask Cameron to provide more. We won't put date certain on when we think the network is \u201cback to normal\u201d. My expectation is, it happened sooner as opposed to later. This isn't something that I think we wait around and see what happens in the first and second quarter. I mean we're actively working on the handful of issues that we need to address and Cameron maybe you want to talk about those specifics. Cameron Scott : Velocity at this particular time is so being impacted as we implement PTC in Chicago, in Kansas city and Houston that's really the last series of implementation that we've ahead of us. There are always challenges when we implement and those big network industrialized heavy areas and we'll work out way through this. We're shipping quickly from implementing PTC to problem solving PTC which requires a technical team to continue to problem solve and that really a human design team to help people become more familiar and try to adapt to the technology that we've asked them to use as they're running trains. So we'll continue to work that throughout 2018 and there are really no other critical issues that's impeding velocity other than that. Lance Fritz : So we've got couple of discrete kind of execution areas that we've got to pick up on but the good news from my perspective is, we got all the resources we need, we got the right team and they're focused on the right stuff. So we - so I expect this to happen sooner not later. Justin Long : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : First following up on the PTC comments. You said you're going to the big metropolitan areas. Cam, if you can give us a guesstimate last quarter on how much PTC implementation shaved off velocity for the network so that would be helpful. And as you look ahead to beyond 2018 in the next couple of years, what's your early sense of the other rails, interoperability and is that going to be another potential challenge for rolling out this system after the first couple legs going through here now. Cameron Scott : During the previous earnings call we estimated half of mile an hour to a mile an hour and that still looks like to be a very solid estimate, somewhere in that range. And as we mentioned some of that, as we troubleshoot, problem solve and train our employees will be recovered. You do highlight the challenge for the entire industry which is ahead of us, which is the interoperability, which we've all been working very closely with each other all along. I don't believe there will be any issues with executing that. it is little bit of unknown. We have yet to marry up with BNSF or Norfolk Southern or CN or CP and really run each other's products on each other's railroads that's ahead of us here this year. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay and their specific time on when you start to cross tracks or link up the systems as you mentioned. Cameron Scott : I'll give you one example that is time certain if you think about Metra. Being a specific Metro in Chicago that cut over with each other is going to be this July. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thank you. And Lance just one quick one for you if I could. On just trade flows globally we've seen some news on tariffs being increased but on the flipside we've got a weaker dollar just been down I think 4%, 5% since you last reported earnings. So just what are you hearing from some of the bigger customers, bigger accounts and what's your view on kind of the upside and downside with potentially more tariffs but offset by what could be a continual weaker dollar which will be a pretty nice tailwind for you and for the industry in general. Lance Fritz : Brian, thanks for that question. There's a lot of moving parts as regards to trade and trade is pretty important to us of course. First we need consumer in the United States to feel optimistic and feel wealthy so that they consume stuff, build homes etc. and that looks like it's set up pretty well as long as the risk and global environment don't kind of overwhelm that optimism. Right now consumers are saying they're pretty optimistic and we see wages starting to increase and they feel pretty wealthy. The second thing that needs to happen is we've got to have open markets and free and fair trade and more open markets is better. While there is some rhetoric that isn't helpful to that, as we're negotiating NAFTA and as the administration observes other trade relationships as of yet. I've not seen it significantly negatively impact markets that we serve nor in conversations with my counterparts in those markets. Are they saying it's fundamentally changing their behaviour at this point? So there is a lot to pay attention to, now that it's, I think the power of tax reform is it almost can't be overstated to some degree. You think about this, every product produced in the United States that has any kind of supply chain to it, all along the way suppliers build in a 35% tax rate historically that drop in 21% fundamentally alters the landscape for cost of goods sold coming out of the United States and at the same time it makes us very attractive, more attractive for capital investment. All of that is positive for railroads. And so I think in the net we're cautious and we're deliberate and diligent on all the moving parts, but I think there is a pretty fair chance that it turns out positive as oppose to negative. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks Lance. Cameron appreciated. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : First one is on the share repurchase, the company committed to 30 million I guess share buyback clip through 2020 back in 2016, you ran a little bit above 20% that rate last year by repurchasing a little more than 36 million shares. Now we have tax reform the share price is up more than 50%, since that target was announced. So just given all those factors moving parts can we assume maybe a bit of a cooling off on the pace of buybacks given those factors and also are you still committed to repurchase your 120 million shares by 2020 from the 2017 date. Thank you. Rob Knight : Amit this is Rob. We don't straight line our repurchases. It's - we're opportunistic in terms of the pricing and the opportunity and we will continue to operate that way. But I wouldn't take, I wouldn't interrupt anything that we've said or what the benefits of the $1 billion of additional cash flow from the tax to imply that we will slow down the pace of share repurchases I wouldn't look at it that way and we were still working through all the details of that, but we think it gives us a greater opportunity on dividends and share repurchases frankly. Amit Mehrotra : So the 120 million targets in terms of share, if it's still very much intact maybe even, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe even some upward bias to that, given the inflows and the tax reform. Rob Knight : I think we're still on track, we're still on track for that. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, one other quick one for me and I don't mean to nit-pick on the core pricing, but I just wanted to be crystal clear on the movement as you move from 3Q to 4Q. you did talk about rounding and offering kind of that 1.75% number in the fourth quarter down from 2%. I just wanted to see was that 2% rounded. Again I'm not trying to nit-pick here but I just want to be clear, was it 2.00% or 1.8% or 2.05% any color there so we're just - we're on the same page in terms of that. Rob Knight : Yes fair point, Amit. And as I said earlier, if you recall in the third quarter I said our pricing when you look at what we yield in the third quarter with just under two, then we refined our convention in terms of the routings. So I would say again the story is not the big change from the third to the fourth quarter and it's probably in the 10 or two tenths kind of range in terms of the way the math flew, so it's not a full quarter of point different. Amit Mehrotra : But the and the mix shifts that impacted, the headline number, I would just imagine would probably accelerate over the next 12 months in terms of the coal intermodal volume. So I know you talked about I guess in response to one of the previous questions that 50% to 60% is obviously the walk to get to your long-term target, but how do incremental margins get to accelerate from kind of back half of the year, when some of the mixed challenges accelerate in 2018. Cameron Scott : Amit, I don't think we really talked in detail about mixed challenges. What we were referring or trying to refer to is that mix is a significant contributor to what happens sequentially quarter-to-quarter to pricing. And if you look at incremental margin which we only really talk to for purposes of kind of illustrating full year, last year was something like mid-60s. the fourth quarter was something like high 30s, right. So the fourth quarter from our perspective was all about fluidity and some incremental cost like little elevated recruise, some little elevated overtime, little elevated [indiscernible] more equipment than we would need normally all adding up expense that need to be there. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay. All right that makes sense. Thank you for taking my questions. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ben Hartford : I just to come back to service real quickly Lance and Cameron. When you with clears the economic outlook has improved the truck market is tighter. There were some headwinds across the rail space noted in the back half of the year that presented challenges to service you talked about the PTC. And I think Lance you said you expect improvement for the year sooner rather than later, but what in your mind is the biggest risk to service improvement historically would suggest that it's accelerating volume growth across the rail network and I think that's clearly a bias here as we started the year, but it's also well telegraphed. So is it the macro and if not then what is in your mind the biggest risk to incremental service improvement during the course of 2018. Lance Fritz : Sure. I'll start and then turn it over to Cameron. I'll call it a service blip that was reflected in our fourth quarter again is not systemic. Historically when we would get into really difficult times, we get behind the resource curve for locomotives TE&Y other labor and it's really hard to catch up in those environments, it takes quite some time given the lead time, the kind of amount of time it takes to get incremental resources back into the network. We're not anywhere near place like that. we've got 800 or 1,000 locomotive stored. We've got a pipeline full of TE&Y that makes sense to us. So it's not that stuffed. From this point going forward service will be about maybe some weather shocks that's always a possibility and making sure we navigate through Positive Train Control effectively that we're problem solving, things that are getting in the way of us being fluid and doing that rapidly. Cam? Cameron Scott : To answer your volume question, which is a good one. Northern region looks sound, western region looks very sound. This really about the State of Texas and very positive growth not only this year but the next several years and that is what is Brazos is meant to address. Plus if you looked under the hood of where we're spending our capacity dollars, it is all pointed at Texas. So we have the right capacity projects pointed at growth to take care of the southern region. Ben Hartford : Okay, that's great. Thank you. And the rather quick follow-up on the other income line item as you looked to 2018, in any direction relative to 2017 on an absolute basis. Rob Knight : Good question, Ben. Because 2017 was an unusually higher year if you remember the third quarter we had couple of larger transactions Kinder Morgan, Seabrook which we called out. So as we looked to 2018 a normal year is closer to call it $150 million range plus or minus rather than you know call it $300 million that we had this year. Ben Hartford : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from the line of [indiscernible] with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : I just wanted to ask a quick one on network performance. Despite mentioning the transportation plan adjustments and I was just wondering if you could clarify whether that was intended to indicate that adjustments to plan impacted network velocity in Q4 or that you intend to make changes to the plan to improve network velocity. Lance Fritz : We always take Beth's forecast and drop it into a model and take a look at a couple basic questions surrounding T plan, whether or not we have enough T plan to offload our terminals and we make adjustments as necessary. So we'll be watching that particularly down on the southern region. Again it's not really a western region or northern region exercise it is focused on the southern region. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's all from me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Great. Thank you. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We're all looking forward to talking with you again in April. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, our Chief Operating Officer (sic) [Chief Marketing Officer] (00:40); Cameron Scott, the Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018, for a first quarter record $1. 68 per share. This represents an increase of 22% and 27%, respectively, when compared to 2017. Total volume increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2017. Energy carloads increased 6%, primarily driven by frac sand shipments, while Industrial and premium volume both increased 2%. Partially offsetting the volume increase was a decline in Agricultural Products, driven primarily by lower grain carloadings. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 64. 6%, which improved a little over 0.5 point from the first quarter of 2017. Our solid first quarter results were a direct reflection of the tremendous effort put forth by our entire workforce, and had not been for some network congestion it would have even been better. I'm encouraged by the work we're doing to quickly regain superior levels of service and efficiency. Our team will give you some more of the details on the first quarter starting with Beth. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was up 2% driven by Energy, Premium and Industrial offset by Agricultural Products, we generated positive net core pricing of 2% in the quarter with continued pricing pressure in our coal markets. The increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 7% increase in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag Products revenue was flat on a 4% volume decrease with an offsetting 5% average revenue per car increase. Grain carloads were down 16% with continued weakness in grain exports due to high global supplies, partially offset by strength in long-haul domestic grain business. Grain products carloads were up 1% as growth in ethanol exports and other biofuels were partially offset by reduced meal shipments to the east due to a strong eastern crush. Fertilizer experienced a 10% increase due to robust export potash demand coupled with increased demand for sulfur from both the mining and fertilizer markets. Energy revenue increased 15% for the quarter on a 6% increase in volume and a 8% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and coke were down 3% driven primarily by a contract change, coupled with lower natural gas prices. Natural gas prices fell 7% versus first quarter 2017 and PRB coal inventories continue to be below the five-year average. Sand carloads were up 52% due to increased crude production from major shale formations and favorable crude oil prices. Petroleum, LPG and renewables carloads increased 22% for the quarter, driven primarily by crude oil shipments. Industrial revenue was up 6% on a 2% increase in volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads decreased 6%, primarily driven by rock, due to weather and service impacts in Texas. Metals volume increased 11% for the quarter, driven by strong OCTG pipe and line pipe shipments into West Texas and Oklahoma. Our specialized markets volume increased 10% overall, driven by military shipments due to continued strength in training rotations and deployments as well as waste shipments due to remediation project growth. Premium revenue was up 7% with a 2% increase in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 5%, driven by continued strength in parcel and stronger demand from tight truck capacity. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand which minimized the impact of lower overall production levels. International intermodal volume was down 2%, driven by increased transloading and changing vessel ports of call. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 2% as a result of lower production levels and high inventories. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and strong truck and SUV shipments out of Mexico. Looking ahead, for Agricultural Products, while we continue to face challenges in the export grain market from high global supplies, potential tariffs and a low-protein wheat crop, we are starting to see some positive indicators resulting from crop uncertainty in South America. We anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports. We also expect growth in food and beverage shipments due to Cold Connect penetration, tightened truck capacity and continued strength in import beer. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products in 2018. We anticipate uncertainty in frac sand due to tougher year-over-year comps in addition to continued concerns around the viability of local sand. We expect coal to continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter with natural gas prices. And as always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand. For Industrial looking forward we anticipate strength in plastics as new facilities and expansions come online, as well as continued strength in Industrial production. For Premium, over the road conversions from continued tightening in truck capacity will present new opportunities for domestic and auto parts growth. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year resulting from new business opportunities. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units, down about 2% from 2017. Production shifts and new import business will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.74, a 17% improvement compared to last year and a first quarter record. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 13% to 2.76. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 38% versus 2017 to 3.05. This result is disappointing given all the initiatives we have been progressing on. But we'll continue our efforts to partner with communities using safety campaigns to reinforce public awareness and safe driver behavior. Moving on to network performance. As reported to the AAR, velocity declined 4% and terminal dwell increased 8% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Multiple factors are affecting our network fluidity. We are experiencing record manifest volumes in our Southern region. Also transportation plan execution at some of our key terminals has contributed to the degradation of our operating metrics. Sequentially, however, we are making improvement. Over the past several weeks, our velocity has consistently increased with all three regions showing meaningful improvement. Systemwide, terminal dwell has decreased by 5%. Our total freight car inventory as reported to the STB is down 3%. More importantly, our operating inventory, which excludes cars that are stored or placed at customer facilities is down over 25,000 cars or 11% since its high in the first quarter. We're intently focused on continuing to improve service levels, and we're confident that we have solid plans in place to achieve better results. Let me provide you with a high-level look at our service recovery initiatives. We are aggressively managing inventory to reduce terminal congestion. This is primarily targeted at the southern end of our railroad. We're closely monitoring car inventory levels at key terminals. Railcars with excessive dwell are being identified and prioritized for prompt handling. We also continue to adjust our transportation plan or T-Plan to route cars around congested areas to the extent possible. We're being more disciplined in running the T-Plan as scheduled, which help locomotives and crews remain balanced. We're shifting volume between some of our Southern region terminals to more effectively balance car flows within network. And we're now complete with the T-Plan adjustments we piloted in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. This resulted in the discontinuation of some aspects of that pilot, while maintaining the positive adjustments that we implemented, including more seven-day per week manifest through trains running on the network. We are improving efficiency at our key terminals. This is the basic blocking and tackling of getting cars in and out of yards effectively. We have increased local train frequency to facilitate spotting cars at our customer facilities in a timely manner after they reach the local serving yard. This also enables us to quickly pull cars from customers once they are released. We have also added more yard jobs, as port yard and terminal fluidity. These changes have enabled us to make significant progress in reducing freight car inventory over the past month. I am confident that going forward, we will continue to see steady improvements to our service and operating efficiency. When you add all this up, the decline in our operating metrics, coupled with service recovery plan we have put in place, has put some pressure on our resources. On the locomotive front, we have reactivated approximately 650 high-horsepower locomotives since mid-2017, including more than 250 high-horsepower locomotives since early February. Currently, we have about 225 high-horsepower road units remaining in storage, and we will continue to bring stored locomotives into the active fleet as needed to support our service improvement efforts. Additionally, we have entered into a short-term lease agreement for approximately 100 locomotives. These units will provide additional surge capacity in case of an unexpected event like a hurricane. On the TE&Y front, we have recalled all furloughed employees back to service and continue to hire new employees to handle expected attrition. Our TE&Y workforce was up 8% when compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by an increase of approximately 800 employees in the training pipeline. We plan to graduate approximately 200 trainees per month between now and July. In some of the more challenging labor markets, we are currently offering signing bonuses to make these jobs more attractive, which is a tool we have used successfully in the past. This does not mean, however, that we have given up on our productivity initiatives. Although the decline in our velocity and terminal dwell metrics are negatively impacting productivity in certain areas, we are still driving productivity elsewhere. G55+0 continues to be an integral part of our daily fabric with respect to how we approach our work. For example, while we are recovering our system fluidity, we were able to continue generating solid productivity in both our engineering and mechanical functions. We also achieved best-ever train size performance in our grain train category during the first quarter. The team also achieved first quarter train length records in our manifest, automotive and intermodal businesses. Looking ahead, we expect network fluidity to return to more normalized levels, as we continue our service recovery efforts. While there isn't a specific date that I can provide you before we reach normalized operations, please be assured that the entire company is working with a sense of urgency and teamwork as we continue making improvement. Next, I would like to provide you an update on our progress with Positive Train Control. PTC is already implemented on nearly two-thirds of Union Pacific's network, and we have a comprehensive plan for installation and implementation to complete PTC. As part of this plan, the Union Pacific intends to file an alternative schedule with the Federal Railroad Administration in order to maintain the health of the railroad network. The remaining implementation schedule will be phased in over the next couple years, so that additional problem solving and system testing can occur, while minimizing operational issues. We do not anticipate the revised schedule will materially change the $2.9 billion estimate of investment required to install and implement PTC. But of course, as Rob has discussed on previous occasions, there will be ongoing capital and operating expense required to maintain and enhance the system going forward. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 2% increase in volume were the primary drivers of the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, up 6% from 2017. Operating income totaled $1.9 billion, an 8% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was a negative $42 million compared to a positive $72 million in 2017. And as we previously disclosed in an 8-K filing on April 6, other income was negatively impacted by a non-cash, pre-tax charge of $85 million associated with an early bond redemption. Excluding the impact of the early bond redemption, other income would have totaled $43 million or about $29 million less than last year. But also keep in mind, we had a favorable pre-tax real estate gain totaling $26 million, which we recorded in last year's first quarter. So if you net out the large one-time items from both this year and last year, other income was essentially flat at $45 million. Interest expense of $186 million was up 8% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense decreased 35% to $401 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of corporate tax reform and was partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings. Our effective tax rate of 23.4% came in a little lower than the 25% rate that we were anticipating. In future periods, we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range. Net income totaled $1.3 billion, up 22% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce record first quarter earnings per share of $1.68. The operating ratio was 64.6%, an improvement of 0.6 percentage points from the first quarter last year. As we have footnoted in the financial handouts accompanying this earnings release, the first quarter 2017 operating ratio was adjusted upward 0.1 points to 65.2% for the retrospective adoption of the new pension accounting standard. Please reference the Investor section of the UP website for the 2017 full year restatement by quarter. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.2 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017. And fuel had a $0.03 positive impact on earnings per share year-over-year. Freight revenue of $5.1 billion was up 7% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $353 million, up $141 million when compared to 2017, and up $60 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the first quarter was slightly positive. Year-over-year growth in sand, petroleum products, metals and lumber shipments offset a decrease in grain carloadings, and an increase in lower ARC intermodal and auto parts shipments. Core price was about 2% in the first quarter, up from the 1.75% we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Coal and international intermodal continue to be a challenge from a pricing perspective. However, if we set coal and international intermodal aside, our core was about 2.75% in the first quarter. For the full year, we still expect the total dollars that we generate from our pricing actions to well exceed our rail inflation costs. Turning now to operating expenses, slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 1% to $1.3 billion versus 2017. The increase was driven primarily by volume-related costs, networking efficiencies and increased TE&Y training expenses incurred during the quarter, and partially offset by our G55 workforce productivity initiatives. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation and overall inflation to be under 2%. Total workforce levels decreased about 1% in the first quarter versus last year. This was driven primarily by a 10% decrease of employees associated with capital projects. Employees not associated with capital projects were up about 1%. Our management employee count was down 600 employees, primarily driven by the workforce reduction program that we initiated last year. Fuel expense totaled $589 million, up 28% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 4% increase in gross ton miles were the primary drivers of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased about 2%, while our average fuel price increased 22% to $2.13 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $599 million. This increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, higher freight car repair expense related to the return of leased cars, and increased locomotive repair costs associated with a larger active locomotive fleet. Turning to slide 21, depreciation expense was $543 million, up 4% compared to 2017. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $266 million in the quarter, which was down 4% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses. Other expenses came in at $266 million, up 2% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in state and local taxes and other expenses, partially offset by a decrease in personal injury expense and reduced casualty costs. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect other expense to increase around 10% versus 2017. On the productivity side, our G55+0 initiatives yielded approximately $35 million of productivity in the first quarter, net of the operational headwinds that we experienced during the year. This is well below what we anticipated coming into the year. We estimate that the impact of these operational challenges totaled about $40 million in the first quarter. The $40 million was spread evenly across the cash cost categories of comp and benefits, purchased services, equipment rents and to a lesser extent fuel. While we are seeing some improvement in our operating metrics, as Cam discussed a minute ago, our full year productivity will be less than our original goal of $300 million to $350 million given the current challenges. Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first quarter totaled $1.9 billion, up slightly when compared to last year. Higher net income was mostly offset by payments made to our agreement workforce in accordance with the terms of the recently ratified labor contracts and the timing of tax payments. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $20.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $570 million since year-end 2017. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times. In light of the higher earnings and cash flow that we expect to generate from tax reform, we are in the process of reevaluating our target leverage ratio and optimal capital structure. As we have stated before, we believe tax reform enables greater debt capacity for Union Pacific while still retaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. From a timing perspective, we will have an update for you at our Investor Day scheduled for May 31 in Omaha. Dividend payments for the first quarter totaled $568 million, up from $492 million in 2017. This includes two recent 10% increases in our declared dividend per share. The first increase occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the second increase was effective in the first quarter of this year. In addition to dividends, we bought back 9.3 million shares totaling $1.2 billion during the first quarter of 2018. This represents a 53% increase over 2017 in terms of dollars spent for share repurchases. Between our dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned about $1.7 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, which represents 132% of net income over the same period. This also represents a 39% increase in cash returned to shareholders compared to the first quarter of 2017. Looking ahead to 2018, we still expect full year volumes to be up in the low single-digit range. As Beth just commented, we're optimistic with several of our business categories but have some uncertainty in other areas. Positive full year volume and positive core price should lead to solid improvements in the top line for 2018. On the expense side of the equation, our current operational challenges will be a headwind to operating expenses in the near term. Our goal is to still achieve an improved full year operating ratio in 2018. And with respect to our targeted 60% operating ratio, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019, we have clearly lost some time given the service challenges that we are experiencing and it is now unlikely that we will achieve that target next year. We're still committed to achieving a 60% operating ratio, just not likely next year, and ultimately a 55% operating ratio. We will provide you with more details on our outlook at our upcoming Investor Day at the end of May. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Rob. As we discussed today, we delivered solid first quarter results despite experiencing operational difficulties. We're pleased with the improvement we've seen in recent weeks, and we are confident in the plan we have in place to continue building on the progress that we've already made. With the economy favoring a number of our market segments, we're well positioned to benefit from another year of positive volume growth and solid core pricing gains. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to start with price and I know you don't give guidance, but hoping that you could help to frame for us directionally if we should be thinking about another step up in that core pricing number in Q2 or the second half? And then some of the drivers behind that? And then, if you think about what's happening with truck pricing, do you think ultimately that could translate into pricing gains that are above what you've seen in prior cycles, of course adjusted for legacy? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Beth, do you want to handle that? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Sure. Allison, we continue to be very encouraged by what we're seeing in the truck market and the opportunities that that gives us both for, as you indicate, pricing gains but also volume gains, bringing more volume onto the railroad. We will continue to feel like we have opportunities in all of our truck competitive markets. Where we're really seeing pressure continues to be in places like international intermodal and in the coal markets Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And maybe just switching to the plastics opportunity that you highlighted. Do you think there's more opportunity to capture export traffic than perhaps you initially thought? Again, given the tight trucking market and equipment constraints, and even thinking about the rebuild activity in Texas and the competition for labor. How do you see that playing out versus your expectations maybe three or six months ago? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: I think that we've always been pretty optimistic that we're going to handle the plastics business to a significant degree. Some of it will be packaged onsite at the original producer, in which case Union Pacific won't have an opportunity to participate. But for those producers that are intentionally using hopper cars as their first means of warehousing, if you will, and then going to a plastics packager for their export shipments, we hope we'll certainly participate at least on that first move. But we do believe that there will be a substantial percentage of this plastics that's produced in the Gulf that will end up West Coast exit from the United States. And we think that packaging facilities like the one we're developing in Dallas right adjacent to our intermodal facility will give us a great opportunity to participate in that. And we are still on track to open that facility with our partner KTN in the late third quarter of this year. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to come back on some of the network challenges and your thoughts around productivity, I guess, for the year. When you think about the $40 million from the first quarter, can you give us some rough estimates of what the net number might look like as the year progresses? I think you said that it's going to be diminish but it's probably going to be there to a degree? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Let me start and then I'm going to turn it over to Rob to fill in some detail. So from the standpoint of the network challenges, we mentioned that those had really started in the second half of last year and there are a myriad of reasons. Ultimately, that culminated in us having too many operating cars \u2013 operating car inventory on us for the amount of carloads that we were generating, which exacerbated the problem, made it worse. We've spent a good part of the first quarter and coming now into the second quarter in getting that right, there's still more work to be done there. And Rob mentioned that in terms of we're still going to face a headwind as we move into the year with excess resources deployed, so that we can get our service product right. But, Rob, do you want to... Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Chris, I would just add \u2013 we're not going to fine point number on what we think that congestion cost is going to be in the second quarter. I will just tell you recall Cam's slides where we are making improvements. We've seen sequential improvement on the one hand and that's all good. But we are bringing on those additional locomotives that we highlighted there. So when you add it all up, we're focused as all can be on getting back, if you will. But in terms of exactly what that dollar amount might turn out in the second quarter, we'll just have to stay tuned. We're aggressively looking to reduce that. And I would also add that even with that $40 million of challenges that we faced in the first quarter, our total productivity was still a positive at that $35 million that I reported. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So the net benefit was still there, that's helpful. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: That's right. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And when you think about the full year OR, I think the goal now is to improve, which maybe is a little less assertive of a statement, I guess, than previously. How do you think about some of the puts and takes there? Seems like pricing's maybe gotten a bit better, at least from a core perspective, and volume has been okay. So what are the dynamics there that might move the needle one way or another that maybe are different now than they were previously? Just trying to get a sense of maybe if there's a different feeling around the OR improvement potential this year? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Chris, I would say it's the same levers that were there before. And that is positive volume, which we feel pretty good about; positive price, which, as Beth talked about, we still feel pretty good about; and then productivity. So yeah, the margin, if you will, of improvement might have gotten a little bit more challenged with what we were facing on the congestion cost. But the levers are frankly the same. And we are fixated and convicted around improving that operating ratio this year. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: And, Rob, I think it's important to note that the fact that we're masking some of the productivity improvements that we have the ability to make through these excess resources to get the network right. That has not in any way diminished both the game plan and the confidence around the game plan of what productivity opportunity we have. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. I appreciate the way you report core pricing is different than others, so I wanted to ask about renewals. Would you be willing to share the average renewal rate this quarter and how that compares to what you saw in the prior quarter? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: We don't really comment on that, Justin. What I would just tell you is we are encouraged again by the tightening truck capacity. And we feel good about our opportunity to get pricing in those truck competitive markets. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe following up on some of the OR commentary. There was the change in language. And I just want to clarify that we're not reading too much into this. Is it fair to say that improving the OR this year could be a little bit more challenging relative to what you thought back in January? And I guess, to follow-up on that, what's your confidence that the OR can improve in the back half? Has that changed at all? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: So let me take the front half of that question, then I'll give Rob the opportunity to deal with the back half. In terms of confidence in improving OR, we are confident in improving our OR this year. Clearly, we would have liked to have made more progress in the first quarter. And we mentioned that in our comments, that we had a solid quarter, I'm proud of the financials, and they could have been better. And when we see that, it's a little bit of a disappointment on our side. But it's also a confidence boost, knowing what we're capable of achieving. Rob? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Justin, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance on the OR. But remember last year the reported OR was 63%. Of course you've got the pension adjustment that affects that. So that's the marker. And, yes, I think it's fair to say that the room for air, if you will, to make improvement is a little bit more challenging this year, given the costs that we just talked about, than it might have been had we not incurred those costs. But we're still focused on making that improvement year-over-year. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great, that's helpful. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'm a bit surprised by the OR commentary relative to the targets that you guys laid out, given the backdrop at least prospectively probably couldn't be better. So I guess the real question is really around incremental margins, which obviously have been lowered in the mid to near term. And I just want to understand that a little bit better. It's really a piggyback to Chris's question. But certainly service levels are getting better prospectively, volumes and pricing are good, pricing's actually accelerating in the quarter. You're also adding costs, so I understand there's some puts and takes there. But relative to that 50% to 60% incremental margin target that you guys have targeted at least over the next several quarters or 1.5 years, what's the right incremental margin expectation now, given those puts and takes? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Amit. I would say that the incremental margin is still a fair way of looking at it. And we still need to average, call it, in the 50% to 60% range. I mean, on a fuel adjusted basis I think in the first quarter it was like in the mid-50s. Absolute, all reported was closer to 40-ish. But we have to get back to that 50% to 60%, and over the long-term we're focused on doing that. And I guess, I would just say that if you're calling out surprise around the OR commentary, you might \u2013 I assume you're referring to the 60%, plus or minus, by next year. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. What we're basically saying there is, that in our mind is a 60%. I mean, that was the guidance that we are taking down and we're going to revisit that when we meet at the end of May. But that \u2013 to achieve a 60% OR from where we are today by next year, we're just saying that's unlikely at this time. We're not giving up on our focus, but that's just unlikely to hit a 60% between now and next year. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just one follow-up question, if I could, on the reevaluating of the optimal capital structure. I know I don't want to \u2013 and I'm sure you're going to discuss this in length at the May end Analyst Day. But can you just help us now, give us a little bit of preview in terms of how you're thinking about it? Because you are retiring \u2013 you've got some high cost debt out there that's trading at a big premium to par. So probably doesn't make sense to buy that back. So when I think about optimizing your capital structure, what I'm really thinking about, correct me if I'm wrong, is leveraging up the balance sheet in a very prudent way to buy back a disproportionate amount of stock, just like Norfork announced that they're going to start doing in terms of accelerating their share repurchases. CSX is certainly doing it. So is that the right playbook in terms of how to think about how you're approaching this analysis from a balance sheet capacity perspective? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. I mean, and I've said this publicly previous, and you're right, we are going to get into this in more detail at the May Investor Conference. But the way we're thinking about it, I mean, we think we have additional capacity both as a result of our ongoing strong cash from operations and then turbo charged, if you will, by the tax reform. And our guiding light is a solid investment grade rating, and we are working with the rating agencies around that. But more to come on that, but we think that gives us additional capacity. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But you're four and five notches above investment grade \u2013 well, investment grade territory. Is it safe to say that you maybe even want to go one or two notches below but still stay well into investment grade territory? How do we think about that? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: More to come on that. I mean, again, I'm not going to get into details here, but again, a solid investment grade rating is sort of that guiding light. And you're right, we're well above that today. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Morning. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So I want to try and take a step back, big picture, how did we get to this place? Volumes are only up 2%, they were up 2% last year, you've got TE head count up 8%. Why are we having these service issues? It doesn't feel like there's that much volume growth that should be pressuring the network? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Scott. So it's not an aggregate issue. It's kind of a more targeted issue. So for us, if you go back to the second half of last year, there were a number of things that we've highlighted that started us down the road of a congested network, specifically ion the Southern region. Part of that congestion was visited in other parts of the network in part with our implementation of Positive Train Control and unintended stops. We've done some tremendous work on reducing that occurrence, and we feel very good and confident about squeezing that out. We did a couple of other things in terms of experimenting with our T-Plan, specifically up in the Pacific Northwest. And that created a little bit of congestion in dwell. We've deconstructed that. We're keeping the piece that we thought was most productive. And then you get down south, basically in our most constrained part of our network, we've seen significant manifest carload growth, which is the type of product that consumes our terminal and yard capacity. So when you put that all together, the way to get out of that as operating car inventory increased because of that congestion is to over-resource the network so you can run on demand. That you don't wait for crews and you don't wait for locomotives. And as Cameron pointed out, we changed our transportation plan so that we actually added starts in order to move cars out of our terminals and in toward customers and in toward interchange. All of that is paying dividends. We see that, as we mentioned, with a $25,000 or 11% reduction in our operating car inventory, and an improvement in dwell and an improvement in velocity. There's more work to be done there, but that's why you get more locomotives than you would need steady-state, more crews than you would need steady state. And once we achieved steady state or as we approach it, you should start seeing us put locomotives back into storage and our appetite for TE&Y is also going to reduce. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I guess that makes sense. And then wanted to ask you one other just, again, on the operating ratio side, I guess. So if we go back a year ago, when we first had the management changes at CSX and we asked all the rails about it, I think what you said is, hey, we'll watch and maybe we'll replicate some things that they're doing and I'm sure they're going to want to replicate some things that we're doing well. I guess, a year later and it's just a quarter, but they now have the best operating ratio for a quarter of any rail, so it seems to be working there. I guess I'm asking, are there things that they're doing that you see that, hey, that works and that applies to us as well like demurrage or hump yards or what, that you think about wanting to replicate so you can get back to having best OR of any U.S. rail? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. So unpacking that, the short answer is yes. We do see both the CSX and the other railroads and other businesses, candidly, other industrial businesses doing things that we can learn from. We experiment with that learning like we did in the Pacific Northwest. Some elements that worked, some elements didn't, and we'll continue to innovate and experiment so that we continue to drive operating ratio. We're very proud of and I think stand on our record of improving operating ratio over the long term while providing a sound and excellent service product and being able to find areas of the market that we can grow into and generate attractive profit and return and we're going to keep that up. So nothing has really fundamentally changed for us in terms of how we're looking at the business and running the business. And what we're holding ourselves accountable for and what our shareholders and communities and customers and employees are holding us accountable for. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thank you for the time, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Lance, if could just maybe follow up on that a bit, if I look at some of the yard services issues, Cam talked about adding new locomotives and crews that you just highlighted. In I guess was it 2004 or 2005 when you launched the Unified Plan, it took that network overhaul. Does this require a network overhaul, so you don't just push problems from one yard to another as you did back in the early days of the 2000s, so you can get the fluidity running on the network? Or is this really just that Southwest and if we can fix that area with the oversupply that you talked about, then it neutralizes itself? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Ken. I think it really is about getting the mix right of the right transportation plan, getting the inventory right and making sure that we have the right amount of fixed capacity available to handle it. You saw us announce earlier that we were firing up Brazos which is a large, modern network terminal in the middle of Texas, that's a key component of making sure that we have the right capacity to handle our business in Texas. We have other capital investments that we're making down in that area that will increase the fluidity and the ability to handle carloads in that area of our network. I don't think we have to deconstruct entirely and reconstruct entirely the game plan. We don't see that. But clearly, we see opportunity to continue to find productivity, both in how we manage over the road and how we manage in our terminals, and Cameron and team are all over that. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So if I can just get my follow-up then on the \u2013 would you then view this low 60% range? You've gone from the 90s to the 80s now to getting to the low 60s. Is this the peak? I mean, is this maybe where the rail network needs to run and operate, so you don't have to keep over-hiring and bring on resources? Or is this just, kind of a slow bleed, whether it's pricing or technology that gets rolled out that can continue to improve those operations, just in order to handle the rebounding growth as it comes? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. We do not believe that there's a choice that you have to make to identify a low-water mark that you stand on in terms of operating ratio. We think that we can run this business in a way that will continually look for opportunities to reduce our operating ratio, and we think there's still opportunity for that. The other thing to note is we don't manage the business solely with a focus on one metric, right. I mean, operating ratio is a very important metric for how efficiently we're running the network. Return on invested capital is a very important measure that we use to make sure that we're making prudent investment decisions. We look at our service KPIs and our quality KPIs and, of course, our safety KPIs. So we believe we can accomplish all of that at the same time. We did a fair job of that in the first quarter this year. I mean, we've shown operating ratio improvement, record EPS, solid increase in operating income, and we think there's more of that to be had. And some of that was masked in the first quarter, because we had excess resources in the network to get back to a great service product. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Appreciate the time and insight. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, good morning. We spent a lot of time on the OR. I was curious, I mean, officially your volume guidance is unchanged from what you put out in January at low single digits. I'm just \u2013 do you feel better, worse about kind of how volumes are going to shape out this year with one quarter under your belt? And can you maybe point to any upside or downside risk outside of frac sand which you already highlight that we should think about there? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Bascome, I would say that the economy feels pretty good to us. Industrial production was very strong in the first quarter. It looks to stay strong as we progress throughout the year. We've had some wins that are public on the international intermodal side that makes us feel good. We do have some uncertainty I'd say with what happens with coal, the Ag markets globally are always a little bit of a question mark for us. And there was something else I was going to say which slipped my mind, oh, frac sand is still, like you indicated, uncertain just because of all the capacity that's coming on locally. So our guidance has been kind of low-single-digit. We're not changing that at this point. But certainly, we're optimistic about having a nice volume year. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you for that. And Lance, maybe one for you. At a high level, I mean, you and Rob have talked about being able to sustain more leverage on the balance sheet. It certainly makes sense from return on equity standpoint, but it also probably reduces your balance sheet optionality if we do get into another round of rail consolidation down the road. I was just thinking about at a board level, is that a conversation UP is having? How do you think about the tradeoffs from that? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Bascome, so we constantly discuss our capital structure. You know, looking at us now and historically, we're pretty conservative in our capital structure. We make sure that we have our powder dry for the what-ifs as we look into the future. So not disclosing anything we discuss at board level, I would tell you that's a constant discussion. Right now, we think both our ability to generate incremental operating income and cash and tax reform gives us the opportunity to in aggregate increase leverage and also to reevaluate the amount of leverage we have. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Rob, I just wanted to talk a little bit, again, about the same issue, right. If we're sort of walking back off of the 2019 target, how do you get confidence that there's enough operating leverage in the business to get you to that 55% number? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I mean, as you know and others know, we haven't put a finite date on that 55%. But as Lance and Cam have commented throughout this morning, we continue to believe, while we've hit this little speedbump, if you will, that doesn't change our conviction and our belief that there's a lot more to be gained here. And we don't just don't pull numbers out of the thin air, we've got real action plans behind, as you've heard me speak to you many times, real action plans behind getting to that 55%. And yeah, we need economy to cooperate. We need to be performing at a high level, we need to continue to get price above inflation to get there, but we're confident in our ability to ultimately drive to a 55%. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But I mean, I guess the primary controversy here or the primary issue here is when the market hears a 55%, is connecting those dots. Like how do you \u2013 is this going to be part of the Investor Day agenda in May? Like how do you help give confidence around that margin potential inside of the business? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, fair point, David, and I would envision that we will be talking to this at our investor conference. And I get the pushback. I mean I understand. We've hit a little speedbump here in the road, and we're going to clear that as soon as we possibly can and get back on the track. But I hear the message that we need to rebuild that confidence in the investor base. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one again on leverage capacity. I just want to make sure, it sounds like you're referencing specifically that you see more debt capacity from tax reform. I mean, it also seems like you would have some additional capacity to match where your peer group is? Are you considering both of those opportunities, are you specifically looking at where you are and the opportunity from tax reform and still wanting to keep a better balance sheet than a lot of your peers? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Matt, again, this is Rob. We'll talk more detail at the Investor conference. But I would say directionally it's both. I mean, you're right. We think we have debt capacity and that is turbocharged by the benefits from the tax package. So we're looking at it as a combination of those things and that's what we're working through with the rating agencies. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Rob. That's all for me. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Apologize if you've covered this already, just overlapping conference call with UPS. But I guess, pricing topic is pretty fertile ground so there's room to talk about it. How do you think about kind of stability you've seen in core price and any potential changes in that? I think from other railroads we have seen pretty good evidence of acceleration in price. So how do you think about that in terms of dynamics in your business and whether that's changing and how big the effect is from coal and international intermodal where you have for a while identified a little more market pressure, market challenges? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. You're right, Tom. We've had a couple price questions already, and they are somewhat similar. But, yes, we continue to see pressure in coal and international intermodal. We are very optimistic and encouraged by the truck tightening. And certainly in our truck competitive markets we're seeing strong pricing. Rob talked about that earlier. If you took coal and international intermodal out, we are at about 2.75% pricing. So there is opportunity out there in the truck competitive markets and we'll be going after it strong. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : So is it reasonable to think that there's room for acceleration in what you're seeing? Or do you think what you're seeing in the first quarter results is kind of representative of what might be the case looking forward? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Well, we don't like to try to predict what's going to happen in the future. All I can really tell you is that we will take advantage of every opportunity to not only go after pricing, but to try to convert that highway business to rail while we see the truck tightening and the opportunity for us to provide value. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So do you still have a fair bit of the book left to reprice this year? Is there still opportunity to get rates up on business this year? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. We are partway through bid season on the intermodal side, and we always are converting over about a third of our business every year and we'll have pricing opportunities as the year progresses. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Okay. Thank you for the time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Sure thing, Tom. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. I'm going to limit to just one question, I guess, maybe directed mostly at Lance or Cameron. And really looking at your capacity. And we've seen other railroads see some capacity issues. I saw you pulled back all your furloughed workers. You've brought in 650 locomotives or reactivated them. Can you touch on is that all of the locomotives that you have in storage now? Or do you still have some remaining? Can you touch a little bit on network capacity in addition to your capacity on the employment side and on the locomotive side? And where any surge capacity \u2013 as I know you touched on that in your prepared remarks. But given some of the issues some of the other rails have had, what confidence can you give that you're prepared for any surges if we should see them? Thanks very much. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Okay. Cam, you want to start? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: Sure. Our Western region and Northern regions are in excellent shape when you look at rail network capacity. It truly is, as Lance mentioned, a Southern region story from a network capacity perspective. And it's a good one, that we're experiencing growth and we're responding appropriately with capacity investment to tackle that growth. From a locomotive standpoint, we still have 225 locomotives in storage. And we will evaluate bringing those back in as our network picks up steam. On the employee side, we don't have anybody furloughed anymore, and we are hiring. And the pipeline is full. It's about 200 employees a month through July that will be landing in full-service. And we'll be evaluating hiring going forward, preparing for the fall. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Walter, part of that answer is, again, when a network business like a railroad gets congested, you can either gut it out, and that takes a long, long time. And usually it means volume goes away. And then, finally, you get enough spare capacity to be able to make the improvements you need to get back to where your plan was. Or you can overload the network so that you can run volume whenever you want. We have a physical capacity that is a rail capacity issue just in a few spots in the South in some terminals and some parts of the line of road. But what we don't want to do is also have that plus a locomotive capacity issue plus a crew capacity issue. So we've over-resourced those areas in the first quarter, clearly. We do have some more powder that's dry in locomotives. And as Cameron says, our hiring pipeline is full. I fully expect, as Cameron and team continue to improve our service product in the South, that we're going to be in a place where we start storing locomotives again and slowing down that hiring pipeline. Where that happens exactly, when it happens exactly, we can't tell. But what we can tell is, as we make improvement, we've got an eye towards being able to do that because those are the costs that are getting in the way of us demonstrating the $300 million to $350 million of productivity that we know we can get this year. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : And did you touch on your workforce that you expect to end the year at? The workforce level? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: No, we did not. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Do you have an estimate around there? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: So, Walter, our view, as you've heard us say many times on that, has not changed. And that is it will move up and down with whatever volume ends up being. We are projecting that volume is going to be on the positive side of the ledger. But it will be one for one. We still expect to achieve productivity as we look at the head count. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : So the 200 per month is a gross number, I guess. You'll be attriting there, so it won't be to that extent, obviously. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: That's right. That's right. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then just one final question, more of a housekeeping. I don't know if you mentioned it. The other expense move around by shifting it from labor into that below the line item. Did you give guidance on that with regards to what we can expect on a quarterly cadence going forward? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: You're talking about on the pension? Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Yes. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Like 0.1 of a percent impact on the OR. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Right. Okay. That's all my questions. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, everyone, for taking my question. So I'll just leave it at one, but Lance or Rob or Beth, you guys \u2013 I think if we look back a few years \u2013 have underperformed the industry in terms of volume growth. And your top line really maxed out maybe looking back at like 2014. And I don't want to steal any thunder from the analyst meeting but what can you talk about from a growth perspective maybe at a very high level where maybe the last decade you weren't able to expand with the market, but looking forward you really want to leverage this unique network that you have and really take advantage of that economics versus the highway. Because we've been hearing about that a long time but the growth just hasn't really materialized specifically for your company? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Brandon, I'll start by saying what we really focus on is generating industry-best operating income and cash, which we do. And some part of whether or not we can get that from the top line volume is predicated on what's happening in the market and what's available to us at what we would consider appropriate and attractive return. But with that, I'll turn it over to Beth and Rob. Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. I wholeheartedly agree with Lance's comments. But what you are seeing I think from us this year in particular, is pretty \u2013 we had some questions earlier about growth, but I think it's going to be a solid year for us. We are having some wins in international intermodal that are, like I said, public. The markets feel good to us. We have great exposure to the growth that's happening in the Gulf Coast in industrial, chemicals and plastics. So just echoing Lance's comments, our focus is very much on getting value for the service that we provide so that we do provide industry-leading margins and returns, and my team is really focused on doing that. We have a great business development pipeline. And we're going to continue to ensure that we put up good numbers in that regard. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Beth, you mentioned earlier in the call about petroleum LPG were pretty strong because of crude oil, but wanted to see if you could comment further on the opportunity to export refined products into Mexico, given all the changes with energy reform and the gateways that you serve into the country? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. We have been participating in that Mexico energy reform market. It started first for us with pretty significant LPG volumes. And then last year and into the first quarter, we did see solid finished fuels, gasoline and diesel shipments. It's a nice growth opportunity. I wouldn't call it a substantial carload potential over the long-term. But we're participating in that market and will continue to pursue opportunities from the refinery complex that we serve in the Gulf Coast down into the key consuming markets in Mexico in partnership with both KCSM and FXE. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the details on that. The follow-up was, you talked a lot about the operations already, but maybe a little more specifically on the freight car inventory for Cam. Is there anything to read into the mix of private cars on the system? It's been pretty high across most of North American network. I understand a lot of that relates to the type of volume and freight that you're moving. But did that add to any of the complications when you're trying to get through some of these pinch points? And do you think it'll have any effect after you reset the network if that does continue from here on out? Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.: I think both Beth and the operating team and the customers are working together very well to try and rationalize that very topic of private freight car inventory. We're making good progress and we expect to continue that progress throughout the remainder of the year. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Just a quick follow-up on that, are you able to incentivize with lower rates or potentially even demurrage or is it just in everybody's best interest to get the fluidity up and to keep it that way? Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.: You know customers are really motivated to do the same thing that we are, which is make money and move their product, right. So we see very rational behavior from customers in terms of adding freight cars to the network based on the cycle times that they see. So as we slow down, we did have some customers that added additional freight cars. I feel like our conversations with those customers about the improvements that were making and the increased cycle time and then causing them to make rational decisions which is pull freight cars back off the network. So I don't see that being any sort of a long-term systemic issue for us. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Beth, Cam, thanks for your time. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes, thank you all for your questions. And we look forward to talking with you at our Investor Day in Omaha on May 31. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. And you may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Baird Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants' lines will be in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me her today in Omaha are Beth Whited, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2018 or $1.98 per share. That is an all time quarterly record for Union Pacific even without the benefit from corporate tax reform. This represents an increase of 29% and 37% respectively when compared to 2017. Total volume increased 4% in the quarter compared to 2017. Premium and Industrial carloadings both increased 6%, while agricultural products and energy volumes were both down 1%. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 63.0%, which was up 1.1 points from the second quarter of 2017. Higher fuel prices had a 1.1 point negative impact on the operating ratio. Strong top line growth was offset by an increase in volume related costs and higher spending due to lingering network inefficiencies. Network performance improved significantly for the first two months coming out of the first quarter. However, service interruptions from a tunnel outage on our Western region and challenges caused by localized train crew shortages created graded a significant headwind in the month of June. The tunnel disruption is now behind us and operations should continue to improve, as graduates from the training pipeline enter productive train service in the coming months. I am confident that we have the right plans in place to drive improvement in our operation and a better service experience for our customers. The team will give you more of the details on the second quarter starting with Beth. Elizabeth Whited : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter our volume was up 4% driven by strength in our Industrial and Premium business groups with offsets in both agricultural and energy. We generated positive net core pricing at 2% in the quarter with continued pricing pressure in our coal and international intermodal markets. The increase in volume and the 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove an 8% increase in freight revenue. With that let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag products revenue was up 5% as the 1% volume decrease was more than offset by a 6% average revenue per car increase. Grain carloads were down 4% driven by weakness in wheat due to a low quality crop and reduced US competitiveness in a world export market. This was partially offset by strong corn and soybean shipments both domestically and for export. Grain products carloads were up 6% due to continued demand for ethanol exports and other biofuels, coupled with strength in animal feed products as a substitute for soybean meal. Fertilizer and sulfur experienced a 5% decrease in shipments as a result of new local production capacity. Energy revenue increased 5% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and coke volume were down 10% driven primarily by a contract change and retirement, coupled with lower natural gas prices. Natural gas prices fell 10% versus the second quarter 2017 and PRB coal inventories continue to be below the 5 year average. Sand carloads were up 24% due to increased crude production from major shale formations and favorable crude oil prices. Furthermore, the favorable crude oil price spread also driven increased in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 19% increase in petroleum LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter. Industrial revenue was up 8% on a 6% increase in volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 8%, primarily driven by rock and cement due to pent up demand and dry weather in the south. Metals volume increased 18% for the quarter driven by strong pipe demand in West Texas and Oklahoma for shale drilling. In addition, strong industrial production drove growth in various other commodities, including industrial chemicals, plastics and forest products. Premium revenue was up 14% with a 6% increase in volume and 8% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 7%, driven by continued strength in parcel and stronger demand from tight truck capacity. We also saw an acceleration in price per load in this segment during the quarter. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over the road conversions and growth in light truck demand which minimize the impact of lower overall production levels. International intermodal volume was up 7%, as new ocean carrier business win began to ramp up in the second quarter. Finished vehicle shipments were up 1% due to stronger second quarter sales increased, production at UP serve plant and strong production and shipments from Mexico. As we look ahead at the second half of 2018, our Ag products group will continue to face challenges in the export grain market from high global supplies, foreign tariffs and a low protein wheat crop. However, we are seeing positive indications in a market due to crop uncertainty in South America. We anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports driven by value as an octane and oxygen enhancer. We also expect growth in food & beverage shipments due to Cold Connect penetration tightening truck capacity and continued strength in Import Beer. For energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. But tougher year over year frac sand comparisons coupled with an emerging local sand supply will continue to generate a level of uncertainty. We expect coal to continue to experience headwinds in the third quarter with natural gas prices. And as always, for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand. For industrial, we anticipate upside in plastics as production levels increase, as well as continued strength in industrial production driving growth in several commodities. For premium, over the road conversions from continued tightening and truck capacity will present new opportunities for domestic and auto parts growth. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market we anticipate year-over-year grow for the remainder of the year resulting from new business opportunities. The US light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units down about 2% from 2017. However, production shift in some new import business will create some opportunities to offset the weaker market demand. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance. Cameron Scott : Thanks, Beth. And good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.76 flat compared to the first half of last year. With regards to rail equipment incidents and derailments, our reportable rate improved 3% to 2.93. In Public Safety a Grade crossing incident rate increased 19% versus 2017 to 2071. While this is disappointing from a year-over-year standpoint, we did show incremental improvement from first quarter to second quarter. We\u2019re optimistic that our continued partnership with communities will improve over Public Safety numbers. Moving onto network performance. As reported to the AAR, velocity declined 3% and terminal dwell increased 4% compared to the second quarter of 2017. During the first two months of the quarter, we made excellent progress working through our operational challenges, improving our network fluidity and associated service metrics. The tunnel on I-5 corridor in Oregon collapsed in late May, filling it with dirt and rock, which required extensive repairs. Traffic was rerouted through Salt Lake City incurring additional transit time of 4 to 5 days which negatively impacted our network performance. With the tunnel disruption now behind us service metrics are starting to rebound and we should continue to see further improvement going forward. The tunnel outage meant more cars spending additional time on the network thus consuming greater locomotive and crew resources. From a locomotive perspective, our surge capacity gave us the flexibility to meet both the network challenges and an increased demand. At quarter end, we had about 200 high horsepower road units and storage. Going forward, we are confident we have ample resources to continue improving service and keep pace with demand. On the TE&Y front, a PNW reroutes, peak vacation season and holidays made June a challenging month. But we continue to maintain a strong recruiting pipeline to meet current and future TE&Y requirements. Our TE&Y workforce is at 8% when compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by an increase of approximately 900 employees in the training pipeline. We graduated about 225 individuals in July and plan to graduate approximately 250 trainees per month in August and September. While crew supply has been fairly tight this summer, it should improve later in the quarter as we realize the benefits of our recruiting and hiring initiatives. Although we have made substantial improvements in our operations, we are not where we need to be on achieving productivity. As we right size our resources, we had significant opportunity to reduce train crew costs and maintenance spending associated with the larger locomotive fleet. We will also refocus our efforts on driving fuel efficiency across our network. Train size performance however continues to be a great spot. We achieved best ever results in our grain category and a second quarter record in our manifest network. In productivity and other areas like renewable capital projects remain strong. While setback - while setback happen they have not stopped us from working hard as we can to bring service back to normal levels. As service improves we will continue to optimize our network and adjust resources accordingly. Our goal is to generate solid productivity savings and operational efficiencies that provide an excellent service experience for our customers, while driving margin improvement. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Knight, Jr.: Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.7 billion in the quarter, up 8% versus last year. Positive core price increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 4% increase in volume were the primary drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, up 10% from 2017. Operating income totaled $2.1 billion, a 5% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $42 million compared to $50 million in 2017. Interest expense of $203 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, and this reflects the impact of a higher total debt balance partially offset by a lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 39% to $429 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of corporate tax reform and was partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings. Our effective tax rate was 22.1%, which came in lower than what we were anticipating. Tax rate reductions were enacted in two states during the second quarter, resulting in a reduction in our state income tax liability. For the full-year, we expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 24%. Net income, totaled $1.5 billion, up 29% versus last year while the outstanding share balance declined 5% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce an all time quarterly record earnings per share of $1.98. The operating ratio was 63%, which was up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 1.1 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017. And fuel had a neutral impact on earnings per share year-over-year. Freight revenue of $5.3 billion was up 8% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $412 million, up $178 million when compared to 2017 and up $59 million versus the first quarter. The negative business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was almost a full point. Growth in sand volumes was offset by an increase in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments. Core price was 2% in the second quarter. Coal and international intermodal continue to be a challenge from a pricing perspective. However if we set coal and international intermodal aside, our core price increased to 3% in the quarter. For the full year, we still expect the total dollars that we generate from our pricing actions will well exceed our rail inflation costs. Turning now to operating expense, slide 19 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 3% to $1.2 billion versus 2017. The increase was driven primarily by volume related costs, network inefficiencies and increased TE&Y training expenses, partially offset by lower management costs as a result of our workforce reduction program that we initiated last year. For the full year, we still expect labor and overall inflation to be under 2%. Total workforce levels were flat in the second quarter versus last year. This was driven primarily by a 10% decrease in employees associated with our capital projects. Employees not associated with capital projects were up around 1%, driven primarily by an increase in the TE&Y training pipeline. Offsetting a portion of this increase was a decrease of more than 500 management employees. Fuel expense totaled $643 million, up 48% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 4% increase in gross ton miles were the primary drivers of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter, compared to the second quarter of last year, our average fuel price increased 36% to $2.30 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate also increased during the quarter by about 6%. While there were some adverse impact from mix the predominant driver of the increased C rate was the service related challenges that we experienced. Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $630 million. The increase was primarily driven by volume related cost, higher freight car repair expense and increased locomotive repair costs associated with maintaining a larger active locomotive fleet. Turning now to slide 20. Depreciation expense was $546 million up 4%, compared to 2017. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%. Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $265 million in the quarter, which is down 3% when compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses and higher equity income mainly driven by the lower Federal Tax Rate implemented in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by higher car rent expense due to volume growth and slower network velocity. Other expenses came in at $248 million up 13% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in property taxes and other expenses partially offset by decrease in personal injury expense and reduced casualty cost. For the full year 2018, we expect other expense to be up about 10% compared to 2017 excluding any unusual items. On the productivity side. Productivity savings yielded from our G55 + 0 initiatives were entirely offset by additional costs as a result of the continued operational challenges. We estimate the impact of these operational challenges totaled about $65 million in the quarter. The $65 million of additional costs were spread somewhat evenly across cost categories of comps - comp and benefits, purchased services, fuel and to a lesser extent equipment rents. Looking ahead as Cam just mentioned, we will be focused on eliminating network cost inefficiencies as quickly as possible so that we can once again begin generating your productivity savings we need to drive margin improvement. Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations to the first half totaled $4 billion, up about 17% when compared to last year. Higher net income and lower federal tax payments were partially offset by payments made to our agreement workforce in the first quarter. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all in adjusted debt balance totaled $25.4 billion at the end of the second quarter up about $5.9 billion since year end 2017. This includes the most recent $6 billion debt offering that we concluded in early June. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.4 times. As we mentioned in our Investor Day, our new target for a debt to EBITDA is up to 2.7, which we will achieve over time. Dividend payments for the first half totaled $1.1 billion up from $980 million in 2017. This includes the effect of a 10% dividend increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an additional 10% increase which occurred in the first quarter of this year. We repurchased a total of 42.5 million shares during the first half of 2018 including 33.2 million shares in the second quarter. This total includes the initial 19.9 million shares received as part of a $3.6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we began in June. We expect to receive additional shares under the terms of the ASR, as the program reaches completion later this year. Between dividend payments and share repurchases we returned $7.8 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are raising our volume guidance and now expect full-year volumes to be up in the low to mid-single digit range. With positive full-year volume and positive core price, we should continue to see solid top line improvement for the remainder of the year. On the expense side of the equation, we're working hard to improve our operations and eliminate inefficiency costs within the network. And we still expect to achieve an improved full-year operating ratio in 2018. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As we discussed today, we delivered record second quarter earnings per share driven by strong volumes and solid top line revenue growth. While I'm disappointed we did not drop more of that revenue growth to the bottom line, I am encouraged by the strength of the economy and the positive impact on the most of our business segments. Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect the strong business environment to continue while we regain our productivity momentum and improve the value proposition for all of our stakeholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the - I guess, obviously, the tunnel impact and there was some constraints on crew. And you identified that $65 million, how would you think about that number in the second half. I mean it seems like the velocities improved in the last couple of weeks and you've got a better crew position. Does number come down a lot in third quarter or is that kind of a gradual thing where you still have meaningful, I guess, service costs in third quarter? Lance Fritz : Tom, this is Lance. So I'll start and then let Rob kind of put details around it. So you got that exactly right. What we said was coming into the second quarter, we were making good progress on improving the service levels, decreasing congestion and starting to move some of those costs out. We had that incident on the I-5 that was very impactful, particularly when it comes to a network that was already a little bit fragile. As are exiting the second quarter coming into the third, we're getting our feedback under us. We see improvement. I don't see any reason absent some other catastrophic event that we don't get right back on the path and start making those same kinds of improvements. Rob? Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes, I would just add, Tom, it won't go away in the third quarter. There will be some lingering costs but yes, we are all about reducing those aggressively and dramatically, and if you just do the math for us to improve our operating ratio year-over-year, that implies that we will make good progress on the productivity front in both the third and fourth quarter. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. On the pricing topic, I mean I guess excluding, I think, international intermodal and coal. I think there was a little tick up to the 3% you identified, but when you look at the total core price at 2%, I think this is the fourth quarter in a row you've been at that level. I would have expected more of a pick up in that. How do you think we ought to look at that going forward? Is that something that just kind of stay - stuck at 2% and that's just kind of the coal international intermodal headwind continue or do you think it's reasonable to expect that kind of a total coal price to pick up if we look at the next two quarters? Elizabeth Whited : Well Tom, its Beth. The coal and international intermodal headwinds continue but we're really encouraged by what we see in the truck markets. ELD definitely had an impact. Capacity is kind of tight across all modes of transportation which is giving us good opportunity to price into that. And just as a reminder we get to touch about a third of it every year and we're halfway through the year so -- and we are like I said encouraged, so. Tom Wadewitz : So it sounds like realistic to - obviously you don't forecast the price it's going to do, but realistic to expect some improvement in kind of broader price momentum? Elizabeth Whited : You are right. We really don't predict what pricing is going to do. Like I said we're encouraged by what we see out there, but we do still have some headwinds that we're still dealing with. Tom Wadewitz : Right, okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi. Thanks good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I guess going back to the operating ratio. Can you quantify what the actual impact was in the quarter from the crews? I guess more specifically the tunnel collapse could have shown some improvement from that just having a hard time getting to run rate into second half that would give you full year improvements on 2018? Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes. Let me take a shot at that Brian. The tunnel and direct cost was about $6 million to deal with that about half OE have capital. So just kind of size the tunnel itself. But it had clearly a residual impact on the efficiency of the network. And so breaking out exactly what impact the tunnel head beyond the direct cost is really kind of a difficult task. It definitely contributed to the inefficiencies much broader across our network that led to the $65 million of cost. In terms of what we have to get them without giving a precise number we clearly have to get and can expect to get back on the drag. Again as I said earlier there'll be some lingering costs in the third quarter but we're aggressively going to reduce from the $65 million daily cost that we had in the second quarter and that's what is going to take to improve the operating ratio year-over-year. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And just a follow-up, As Lance mentioned network is a little bit fragile. So I guess it's time for another PTC update. I'm just want to see how that was trending and on the labor side this is I guess second call we've heard call out on vacations potential headwind on the crew side. So - market's tight overall. I just wanted to get to your sense as to the pipeline being full enough to kind of finally get over the hump here when it comes to gaining crews need the most. Lance Fritz : Cam do you want to handle the PTC and a little bit about crews? Cameron Scott : On the crew pipeline as you say you will see the numbers on what the plan to enter into workforce for August and September. That pipeline looks very solid for the remainder of the year. So as Lance mentioned we do not see a crew issue going forward. It will solidify. On the PTC front our unattended breaking ratio is dropping. That's very positive. And we have initiatives to continue dropping that ratio. Total stops are about the same at this point as we bring more trains on board to that new technology. So net it's about the same. But the good news is we're making very positive progress on the stop ratio. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks for the details. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Ken Hoexter : So you mentioned the upside to your outlook on the revenue side, but Beth mentioned some tariffs impacts on the agriculture. Just wanted to see Beth are you starting to see that spread in any sort of way as they have expanded the tariffs. And kind of maybe Lance your thoughts on impact on the trade. I know you made some comments on the conference recently. Maybe you can expand on that a little bit. Lance Fritz : Sure. I'll start Ken and then let Beth talk specifically about our markets. So the concern is that tariffs are just basically going to be a tax, whether it's on U.S. consumption or US products going overseas. And generally, that's going to reduce the amount of demand. We haven't necessarily seen that wholesale and I'll ask Beth to kind of fill in the blanks in detail. But it's pretty early. Those things just went into effect. We have seen some very specific impacts on us. But they are pretty granular, right. Inbound on some rail that we buy from Japan. There was a substantial 25% tariff on the last boat that was received. And then we've seen some other discrete impacts on customers. But Beth do you want to fill in the blanks? Elizabeth Whited : Yes. So when we talk about agriculture, we aren't really seeing the impacts yet, because of the crop uncertainty in South America that I referenced. So I think this year, the Ag business looks okay in the United States. But I think where we're more concerned is in the longer term, what the impacts will be. And really the other impacts on steel, for example, have kind of a net neutral for us. But anyway to Lance's point, the longer term trade, free trade impacts are the thing we're really keeping an eye on. Ken Hoexter : Great. And just a follow-up for Rob, if I can. Given the increased expenses, it sounds like with some Lance's comments about the tight network. Do you think the \u2013 are we still at a $3.3 billion CapEx or the increase that given the outages? And then just a number question, I guess on your buyback yet, $5.5 billion in buyback 33.2 million shares that will be $166 a share. I presume that's not corrected up, because you still have shares coming from the accelerated buyback. Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes, Ken. On the capital, we're not into planning on increasing to capital. We think the 3.3-ish has discovered for what we need to do to address the issues that we currently have upon us. On the buyback, yes, that's exactly right. The math that you just did is missing the remaining call it 20% that will be delivered later this year of shares that are a part of that ASR. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the input. Appreciate it. Thanks for time. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So Beth, we've been talking about pricing pressure in international intermodal for quite some time. So I'm wondering if you could hash-out the new contract win that you called out there because you did see some volume acceleration finally. And how do you put that into context of this pricing pressure? I think we've been hearing about now for maybe two years. Elizabeth Whited : So we were doing business with call it two-thirds of the alliance of ONE prior to them combining, and so when we won the rest of that business that's obviously given us that volume boost. The market is still, I would call it in some - its not exactly in disarray, but there still remains a lot of pressure in that particular market, and we're subsequently seeing quite a bit of pricing pressure in that market. Not only I guess there's different kinds of - there's different kinds of competition right. There's direct competition with other railroads. There's competition with trucks and then there's competition with other ports. And so all of those things bring different levels of competitive pricing pressure to the market, and that's really what we're dealing with. Brandon Oglenski : Well, I guess, coming out of your Analyst Day a month or so ago we got the message from you guys that you don't want to just grow for growth sake and you want to make sure you're bringing on the right price. So I guess that was I was giving out, are you happy with the price of the new contract that's coming on? And I think you also said you can only reprice maybe a one third of your intermodal business. So should we also believe that there's just not a lot of escalators on those contracts either that you can recoup inflation? Elizabeth Whited : Okay. So we -- I agree with you. We're interested in growing both price and volume. And we are intently focused on making sure that we receive the value that our capacity is worth when we do both of those things. So as we look forward what you see is we've kind of got two books of business if you will in intermodal right? You've got the international intermodal business which is generally in more like the three to 5 year contracts that have some sort of an escalator in them that at the time we did the deal we're quite comfortable with. And then you've got the domestic market that tends to reprice annually, and that domestic market tends to be very truck competitive and that's where we really feel pretty good about what we're seeing in terms of the tightening truck capacity and our ability to get pricing. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Rob on the core pricing growth. That 3% ex coal international intermodal that you highlighted any help on where that was on an apples-to-apples basis maybe in early 2015, so we can just give a sense of where we are in the pricing cycle so to speak, X those kind of specific headwinds and how much room there is versus the prior peak? Thanks. Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes. I don't have that number off hand. I will tell you that mix would come into play. But I would just tell you that three is up from roughly 2.75 earlier this year. So we're feeling good about that number. When you added all in I don't have a reference to 2015. Amit Mehrotra : I mean, okay. Just a quick follow-up to that. Do you think based on the pricing environment that you see today on the volume environment obviously getting a little better? Do you think the trajectory of core pricing should be up or do you think kind of given the guys calculated kind of flat at these levels are better way to think about it? Robert Knight, Jr.: Well, I would just reiterate what Beth said earlier. We're not going to give the precise answer that you're asking. But as Beth said earlier we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the environment and that if were able to achieve real pricing going forward that will show up in our yield calculation. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I thought I tried anyways. I appreciate it. Robert Knight, Jr.: I get it. Amit Mehrotra : Let me ask one more. To be fair this might come across a little bit of a tough question and it's not some meant to be that way. It just comes across that way. But it's obviously on the OR. If you add back the $65 million headwind in the quarter the profitability of the business is still several hundred basis points lower than what CSX reported in the second quarter when arguably I would say Union Pacific has some structural advantages with respect to returns just given the geographic difference. So I understand obviously this is a tough question, but Lance, is there a sense of urgency that's been elevated. If you can just help us think about how your views may be evolving in light of what's happening in the east and how you're managing the railroad either from a customer negotiation standpoint or from a customer standpoint? I appreciate it. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Sure. Notwithstanding what any other railroad is doing, you can see our elevated sense of urgency and focus and determination when, our headline quote for a quarter where we just generated our record earnings per share and record income is and it could have been better, because it could have been better. To your point, we called out $65 million in costs in the network that really shielded us from generating much more attractive productivity. We demonstrated we know how to do that. We had underlying productivity that was being generated in the quarter, and it's frustrating that we weren't able to drop more of that top line to the bottom line. So as we talked through and shared with you or the team at our Investor Day, we are laser-focused on getting the network right. We're learning from anyone that we can in terms of better ways to run the network, better ways to generate productivity and efficiency. We've got all of those projects teed up, lined up. It's hard to make them pay off in an environment where you're basically over-resourced and trying to get the service product back up. We are doing that. That will happen and we will take those excess costs out, which is why we're so confident that we're able to hit that 60 operating ratio in 2020 because we see the underlying strength of the business, top lines growing. Price is attractive. We've got plenty of productivity opportunity and we know how to get at it. We just got to get rid of these excess costs in the network as we bring our service product back up. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much for answering my questions. Have a good day. Operator : Your next we comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Group : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So first, can you just clarify what operating ratio you're using for the full-year 2017? And then, I just want to follow up on that last question sort of about CSX and comparison versus you. We've heard the last few quarters, you talk about, well, we're watching and seeing what other rails are doing and other companies are doing, but it sounds like what we heard today is a part of the six year is adding more head count. CSX just took 11% head count out. I mean, it's clearly working there. I guess, the question is, why aren't we talking about a real sort of change in strategy here to more sort of fully embrace sort of this precision railroading concept that seems to be working at? Maybe you said, again, we're earning from other things. Is there anything that you see that you're actually implementing that can give us some sort of confidence in the trajectory of the productivity and margin improvement? Lance Fritz : Yes. Sure Scott. I'll take that and then I'll let Bob talk about what 2017 full year operating ratio we're using as a comparator. So we discussed this last quarter and also at Investor Day. There are a number of things that we're already doing that we've learned from somebody else whether it's the CSX or the CP, CN. One of them is we've reduced our low horsepower fleet by one-fourth over the course of the last three years. That has been a fundamental underlying productivity driver even as in 2015 and 2016 our volumes dropped at 12% 13%. We maintained operating ratio. So that's an example. We talked about the blend and balance pilot that we ran up in the Pacific Northwest that a fair portion of is still in place. We're right now in the process of continuing to blend and balance our network that is deconstruct specialized networks and reconstruct them as shared networks so that we can balance out our resource consumption whether it's crews and locomotives. The thing that's frustrating Scott isn't that there's no activity on good ideas to generate more productivity is that we really value the service product to our customers. And first and foremost we're going to give them an excellent service product. And we've got a very big broad franchise which is a strength of ours. We think in the end that's going to generate if you will winning in the marketplace to do that we've got to generate that excellent service product and experience. And we're not telling you that we need to add more crews over and above volume that much different. We're saying we've got to get our crews right so that we can get that service product back. That is happening as we speak. And even so in this quarter volume was up 4% and our crew bays was up mostly in the training pipeline and the active crew base that was basically flat. So we see productivity as being able to happen. We think it is merely masked right now. And yes there are other initiatives that we've got teed up that we can do and will do. Robert Knight, Jr.: And Scott the comparison on the OR that we're using for 2017 full year is 62.8. So to your point we reported 63 OR the pension impact in 2017 was about 0.2. So adjusted is 62.8 we're comparing ourselves to. And by the way the pension impact for us this year would be negligible call it a 10th headwind for us. But again our commitment is to improve the OR year-over-year against the 62.8. Scott Group : That's helpful. And can you just -- I just want to make sure I understand one point because you said you don't need to grow headcount as much as volume. I thought that any headcount was up 8% maybe you could just clarify what if that's a training thing or not. Lance Fritz : Sure. It's all into training pipeline. I thank you understand that the training pipeline lasts about four or five months. And it's designed to basically backfill attrition and the TE&Y workforce. So we supercharged the training pipeline. And then as they graduate they're basically backfilling active employees who are retiring or trading out of the workforce. So our active workforce is basically flat to marginally up and that's what we anticipate. We will not grow the active workforce faster than we're growing volume. Scott Group : Okay. Make sense. And then just last question, just pricing. I know you're not to forecast pricing. One of the things that some of rails are starting to give and it's helpful they're talking about contract renewals. Can you may be share where contract renewals are tracking, is it above at this 2% range maybe that'll be helpful. Elizabeth Whited : Yes. I don't think we're going to start using that as a metric that we measure ourselves. We're pretty happy with the way we do it in terms of being conservative and seeing actual results before we start forecasting. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you. Elizabeth Whited : Okay. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning, guys. Switching gears for a second, the domestic intermodal pick up. Beth, could you talk a little bit about what you guys are doing to actually sort of take a little bit more share in that marketplace? And how we should expect those changes to kind of impact the longer term growth rate, like is this like a one-time contract win kind of thing, or is this actuals or a service design changes that you've been making? Elizabeth Whited : In domestic intermodal? David Vernon : Yes. You said \u2013 you guys said domestic was up in terms of volume, right? Elizabeth Whited : Yes. Domestic is up in terms of volume. I would say, number one, we're doing a lot of things to go and build relationships directly with the BCOs to make sure that we're able to express the value that Union Pacific can provide. We have numerously more lanes of intermodal service than our competitor. And so we tried to raise the awareness of that with the BCO community. And as the truck tightening has occurred, what we've seen is a pretty significant return from that investment that we're making and ensuring BCOs know that what we can provide. So we are seeing new customers as well as stronger volumes from existing customers. David Vernon : And as you think about the go-to-market strategy on that stuff, the business that you're growing in there, how would that compare on a pricing standpoint relative to the existing base? Is it kind of an attractive set of rates? I'm just wondering like the simple... Elizabeth Whited : The way that we think about our business is that we always are striving to ensure that we're generating value and good margin that ultimately drives stronger return for the corporation. David Vernon : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. So, of course, we know about intermodal with respect to the tight truck capacity and intermodal conversions. But curious to know, if you're either seeing or if you think this is an opportunity or if there's an opportunity to convert traffic from the highway in the merchandise segment? Elizabeth Whited : Yes. I would say so. We're converting traffic from the highway into merchandise segment. One of the best examples I can give you is line pipe that's used for drilling that used to be a heavy truck market. Because it's relatively short-haul out of kind of the Houston Gulfport into the Permian and up into Oklahoma. But we've pretty really targeted business development effort at that and we've been able to convert a significant portion to rails. So we're excited about that. And we have a number of other initiatives across market, but that's maybe one of the best examples I could give you. Allison Landry : Okay. And do you think that given some of the dynamics that are happening right now with the driver shortage being worse than we've seen it historically. Does that create a bigger opportunity on the merchandise side? Elizabeth Whited : I think it does. There's a few markets in particular where that's true. One of them is in the fresh and frozen space. The truck availability is really tightened there. There's a lot of demand for that in the east-west long-haul. And that's something that we're very focused on the. Lumber is another win where -- trucks had penetrated in some areas where we're now seeing people returning to rail and wanting more rail. Allison Landry : Okay. And I wanted to also ask about what you're seeing in terms of the network performance in the southern region specifically. I mean you've talked quite a bit about some of the pinch points down there. So just curious if you've seen any sequential improvement in the second quarter and the expectation for the second half. Elizabeth Whited : Cameron? Cameron Scott : The southern region, Allison has been performing very well in the second quarter. We do see volume coming online from some of the new plant expansions that Beth has mentioned in the past. And with some of our new inventory management tools, we've put in place we think the southern region will stay solid stepping into second half of the year. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, team. Quick question. When I'm looking at your volume outlook in the second half and I'm comparing that to the first quarter numbers. It looks like automotive sales is the one that kind of flipped it went from a negative to a question mark. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that. Elizabeth Whited : So in the second quarter we did see a little bit of strengthening in auto sales. I think you got in June like a 17.5 SAR which was pretty high compared to what we've been seeing in the earlier part of the year. A forecast that we've seen from the OEMs as well as from some of our business development efforts appear to make that more of a neutral for us where we thought it was a bit of a negative question mark earlier. I don't think we're going to see massive growth they are or anything but it feels a little stronger than it felt earlier in the year. Jason Seidl : Okay. Fair enough. And Rob if I can go below the line as we look out for the other income line item, you sort of gave the guidance for other revenue. I don't know if I heard the other income because you have a pretty tough comp here coming up in 3Q for modeling purposes. Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes, you're right Jason. Because last year you're calling out a good point. Last year's comp is difficult. We had some unusual transactions that we called out. I would say generally it could be lumpy and it's hard to predict. But I would say somewhere in the $30 million to $40 million quarter range is a reasonable range expectation for other income. Jason Seidl : Okay. That\u2019s good. I appreciate it. Then thank you for the time as always everyone. Robert Knight, Jr.: All right, Jason. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You had petroleum products as a positive and market for you. Can you just give us a little more detail on how you are looking at the Permian opportunity? How attractive that can potentially be and kind of what you will need to see some of the producers before you get more active there? Elizabeth Whited : So the Permian is an interesting place right now. We are definitely starting to see some reduction even in crude output because of the lack of take away capacity. So that's maybe the first time we've seen that in 18 months or so. And there is as you referenced an emergence opportunity to haul crude by rail out of there say over the next 18 months while the next pipelines get built. Like I said we do think it's a short-term situation. So we will not invest to support that. But as we have capacity in our network we are working closely with the producers to see what we can bring to rail. And I do expect we'll we some results from that in the third and fourth quarter. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And Lance, going back to the whole UNP versus CSX, if I may, I think there's tends to be a hyper focus on the OR as a stand-alone number without focusing on overall sustainable growth, and I think that you guys are growing volumes at a relatively decent pace compared to the whole railroad group. So can you remind us on your philosophy on volume growth versus OR and kind of how you determine which one you go after at any point in time, particularly at this point in the cycle? Lance Fritz : Sure, and you are exactly right, Ravi, we care about a number of measures to demonstrate whether or not we're running the business well over the long term. The highest order is generating growing operating income and growing cash from operations. That's the source of being able to reward our shareholders, so that's what we focus on first and foremost and we actually had a pretty damn good first half in that context. Now having said that, there's a couple of key measures that we care about. One is ROIC, and that is, are we efficiently using resources and being wise with investor capital? And the other is OR, and that is, are we efficiently dropping top line to the bottom line. At this point, it's appropriate to focus on OR and say, we're disappointed with our ability to efficiently drop top line to the bottom line. That doesn't mean we can't do it. It means we didn't demonstrate doing that in the second quarter; we have all the confidence in the world that we're able to do that both over the long run and rectifying that here in the short term. Then the last thing I would talk about, Ravi, is we run the business for all four stakeholders, right, in the very long run building long-term enterprise value, we have to generate returns for the shareholders, build their confidence. We have to generate excellent experience with our customers so that they want to keep doing business with us. We have to help our employees feel fulfilled and connected to the work and our communities that we serve have to feel like we're a good partner, so that our social license to operate with them is healthy and strong. You hit it just right, Ravi. We think about all of that when we're running the business. Ravi Shanker : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long : Thanks. And good morning. Just to start with a couple of modeling questions, I was wondering if you have a ballpark expectation on the level of share buybacks you're planning to complete in the second half of this year? And then, on coal, I think I heard you mention a contract change. Any additional color you could provide on that and the impact? Lance Fritz : Rob. Robert Knight, Jr.: Justin, I would say that I don\u2019t any more to tell you on the share buyback. I mean at this point the ASR that we did. The rest of opportunities would be opportunistic in the marketplace. And remember that we've set out a $20 billion buyback over the three year period or so but it's not going to be a straight line each quarter. So we'll be opportunistic. Lance Fritz : And Beth? Elizabeth Whited : So on the coal contract. We call that a couple of things. We have some retirements and we also have contract change. And those were about equivalent in size, in terms of millions of tons that we saw leaving us. I don't think we're going to give you any specifics on that. But I guess that's all I've got to say about it. Justin Long : Could you speak to what coal volumes would've looked like X both of those items that headwind from the retirement of the contract change? Elizabeth Whited : I would call the combination of the two less than 10%. Justin Long : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, if you go back historically you've typically seen a sequential improvement in the OR during the third quarter. I think last year was on one of the rare exceptions. I am not asking for specific guidance but just directionally is there anything that would prevent you from seeing normal seasonality and a sequential improvement in the OR in the third quarter? Robert Knight, Jr.: Justin, I would say you're right. It's difficult to draw any conclusion from that. But having said that we are as we've talked this morning we are feeling good about the environment. We raised our volume guidance for the whole year. You heard Beth talk about our confidence in terms of the market and what's happening in your pricing. And our focus on taking that inefficiency cost out aggressively. So without putting a guidance number for the third quarter OR we're going to aggressively do the best we can and we have to make progress immediately which we're focused on to improve the OR year-over-year. Justin Long : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the time this morning. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Reustle : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on higher fuel prices, I understand it's essentially EBIT neutral but it's been a pretty big drag on the OR year to date. So is that something you could offset in the back half of the year and is there an inherent fuel price assumption in your forecast for the back half of the year? Robert Knight, Jr.: Let me take that Matt. I think you probably know I mean we have some 60 different types of fuel recovery mechanisms surcharge mechanisms. So they're kind of all different. But there's -- and there's generally speaking about a two month lag in terms of those catching up with the price of fuel. So in the long haul the fuel recovery mechanisms should neutralize over time. Certainly in the second quarter from an EPS standpoint it was neutral. Rising fuel prices even if we're recovering 100% at a specific point in time can have an impact negatively on the OR just because of the math of it. So I mean that's how it works. So we had to kind of leaves with that reality and our focus and we've done a good job over the years of minimizing the negative impact of rising fuel prices through these some 60 plus different fuel surcharge mechanisms. Matt Reustle : Yes. I guess it has been a drag for the first half. I mean are you expecting that drag to continue into the second half? Because you mentioned it's just math but you're guiding to this improvement which seems like it's going to be fairly tough if you continue to see that weigh on margins on top of the ongoing network expenses that you have in the third quarter. Robert Knight, Jr.: Well I would have to say I can't give you a number because it's contingent about what happens in the fuel prices. Matt Reustle : Okay. Second question just on frac sand, you mentioned tougher comps coming into second half along with the impact of the local mines, in terms of those local mines have you seen any shifts in terms of the timing of those coming online and is a tight trucking market changing those dynamics at all? Have you been having those conversations with customers where you expect to see a material impact in the back half of the year? Is that shifting out to 2019? Any color and that is helpful. Elizabeth Whited : Yes. So we have -- they did come up more slowly than we expected and they were delayed. However they seem to be now kind of hitting their stride. And I think some of it is a combination of supply and some of it's the slow down in production that's happening because of the lack of take away capacity. But June was the first month that we had this year where our frac sand into the Permian was lower than a year ago. And I would expect to see that continue as they gain more and more adoption, especially on the core smashes [ph], the local sand. So yes, it started to decline and it will continue. On the positive side, we've been able to develop and have seen good growth in all of the other shale price. The Eagle Ford came on strong in the second quarter. We're seeing nice growth in the Oklahoma shale and then Colorado. So we will, of course, continue our business development efforts. But the Permian is in decline, I would say. Matt Reustle : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask Rob, just want the clarity first on the service related cost of $65 million. Is that cumulative or is that sort of second quarter it happens that really relative to the $40 million, you reported in the first quarter? Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes, the $65 million of inefficiency cost in the second quarter was just the second quarter and that does compare to \u2013 I mean showed up differently. But it does compare to the $40 million inefficiency cost that we called out in the first quarter. Lance Fritz : Yes, I think Chris when we talked about in the first quarter we said there was going to be a hangover effect even as we were anticipating improving service product in the network. And that's because we were putting those resources in through the first quarter. So there were more exiting the first quarter than entering the first quarter. So they just lingered longer than we anticipated. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. And when you think about -- in that context when you think about the tunnel, which I know Rob you said it was $6 million, but had a bigger halo effect than that. Does that sort of capture the entire increment if you think 1Q to 2Q or is it just sort of the timing of those assets? Just wanted to get a sense we're actually seeing improvement there because it seems like maybe there's some incremental cost that weren\u2019t in the first quarter but... Lance Fritz : Yes, Chris, the way to think about that is, so we were building in these incremental costs through bring the service product back up. We anticipated as a service product was coming back up, which it was in the first two months of the quarter that we would be actively then taking those incremental resources out. The tunnel collapse forced us to keep them in. And basically keep them in longer in order to kind of maintain a service product because it was a pretty impactful location. Recall that in our network we've got big East West movements on the Sunset route in the Northern East West corridor. And then the other two big routes for us are Chicago down to Mexico in the I-5. And it's essentially shut down the I-5. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. And then just final a quick follow-up for Beth on the core price, not to belabor the point here but you had the ex coal in international and intermodal number accelerate from 1Q to 2Q. But coal stayed the same all in. When you think about coal and international intermodal is it getting more negative or is it getting worse I should say from 1Q to 2Q or is there some other dynamic that impact that number? Elizabeth Whited : I think you're making a safe assumption. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes on line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I do want to come back to the pricing, but I don't want to exclude coal and international intermodal instead ask a more general question based on investor feedback I'm getting and that is rather than you give us guidance on price make the comment that I'm hearing that your ability to drive price because of the inclusion of international intermodal and coal combined with the competitive environment with BN might suggest that you can never achieve core pricing above and beyond or even half of what other railroads can achieve. If that's a statement correct me -- can you indicate where it might be wrong in terms of that emerging view in your pricing? Lance Fritz : Yes. We need to correct that assumption or statement which is we can never achieve pricing the same as any other competitive railroad. Our dynamic and pricing is just that it's dynamic right? So the competitive forces change. They change over time. Sometimes they change quickly. Right now we love the environment that we're pricing into when it comes to truck competitive product. And there are some other markets that we're pricing into that are facing different pricing competitive dynamics. Those aren't set in stone. It's not like that's a law of nature. Those will and do shift. And I anticipate we're going to continue to price appropriately for the value that we represent and generating a really attractive return. Walter Spracklin : So is it just the basics of a cycle we're in where mix is not going your way but it is going the way of the others that are getting the 4% to 5% pricing? It's just a bad timing. Is that what you're saying? Lance Fritz : What I'm saying is exactly what I just said which is we price for the value. We're pricing for an attractive return. We're pricing in a competitive dynamic. And those move a lot and it's generally a good market to be pricing in right now. The other thing I would say is -- remember exactly how we talked about price. We talked about yield and absolute yield dollars over total book of business. It's a nice conservative consistent way for us to measure ourselves in terms of yield that we're achieving and we're pretty optimistic as we look into the second quarter. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And then moving again back to the question on operating ratio. If I could reframe the question and simply ask, if you could maybe in broad categories why are you not at a better operating ratio today? If you were to look at the others and say why is Union Pacific not with the others in terms of operating ratio today? What would you point to as the main reasons? Lance Fritz : So I'll start by saying we are actually better than the others although the CSX just produced a very good second quarter. So I'm not sure I want to go backwards to join the rest of the pack. But having said that, there are some very specific cost elements that are in the way right now that we are actively getting out of the way. And I'll let Cameron speak to those and what we're doing about it. Cameron Scott : As velocity comes back to our network one particular area is the size of our locomotive fleet. And that has a positive impact in three different areas. Material to keep that fleet up and running, employee cost involved in working on those locomotives and then fuel usage as well to move the tonnage that we have on our network. So velocity returns would be very aggressive in rightsizing that fleet. Walter Spracklin : And correcting for those will give you a better generation toward a sub 60 and I know you saw the 55 OR target there. What gives us comfort that the 55 is achievable within a reasonable investment horizon? Cameron Scott : Yes. So the $65 million that we called out is kind of excess recovery cost in the network this quarter. That's entirely over time and kind of inefficient use of crews, incremental cost of maintaining locomotives as Cameron just outlined, a sea rate that's both impacted by all the locomotive fleet as well as inefficient use for those locomotives. And then a handful of other Nits N Nats and which is mostly kind of like car hire for excess inventory. All of that is addressable. And when we remove that we have a much more attractive second quarter and not only that but that doesn't count the productivity initiatives that that's retarding from accelerating even further. So we're very confident in the 60 by 2020. Walter Spracklin : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben Hartford : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Rob, could you clarify what you expect the tax rate to be in the back half of the year? Robert Knight, Jr.: Yes. For the full year, we're projecting its going to end up being around somewhere 24-ish. So I think it's reasonable to assume it's going to be around that 24 in the back half. Ben Hartford : Okay. And in terms of just staying on the point about intermodal, what are -- could you size up UMAX and the MP fleet as it stands today? What are the expectations for that finishing this year and perhaps 2019? If we can have any sort of direction on that front. Elizabeth Whited : Are you asking about the number of containers that we have? Ben Hartford : Yes. Elizabeth Whited : Boy, that's a stumper. I think it's around 40000 each, but I will confirm that back from Mike and make sure that we give the exact number. But it's something like that. Ben Hartford : That's a present number? Elizabeth Whited : That's a present number. We have some small additions we're making this year. But nothing that really moved the needle. Ben Hartford : Okay. And that would be for both of those fleets? Elizabeth Whited : They are roughly to same size. Ben Hartford : Right. And then in terms of just small additions in both fleets in the back half of the year? Elizabeth Whited : Small additions only in the EMP fleet. Ben Hartford : The EMP. And any thoughts about '19 as we look and obviously rising truck load rates generally presume service improvements and an eye toward domestic intermodal being used in 2019? Any thought as it relates to capacity needs in '19 and potential additions to either those fleets? Elizabeth Whited : We are currently looking at what we think we might need in 2019. We have some attractive business development opportunities as you suggest. But we haven't quite zeroed in on a number yet. And we do have some fallout as well. So we'll be looking to acquire containers. I don't think we know how many yet. Ben Hartford : Okay. Is it possible that if you had positive let's say mid single digit type growth in domestic intermodal in 2019, are there enough opportunities to improve service and velocity such that net adds could possibly be flat in 2019 to both of those fleets? Elizabeth Whited : We\u2019re just really still in that evaluation process. I'm not sure what to tell you about that at this point. I think we'll get clearer as we get towards the end of the year. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to get you to comment on this year's peak season in a couple of respects. Firstly, one of the things that we're hearing anecdotally is that the peak season may have arrived early and potentially as early as June as BCO is try to get ahead of tariff. So just wondering if that's a dynamic you've been observing in your business. Elizabeth Whited : I would not say that we think the peak is arriving early so much as I would say there's a strong demand because of tighter truck capacity. It still feels like there will be a peak that's kind of normal time period. Lance Fritz : That's really encouraging Cherilyn right? From the standpoint of -- it's not like peak is happening now and then it's going to die off during normal peak. It feels like we've got strong volume entering what feels like it's going to be a normal peak which is really attractive. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay. And in terms of just your readiness operationally it sounds like you're feeling good. The only thing I wanted to ask about was it does sound like it could be a robust peak. Is there any reason to be concerned about the readiness of the Chicago Gateway in that context? Lance Fritz : I don\u2019t think so absent let's say product design changes that potentially goofed up the network. So if the network stays as designed right now amongst all the participants that interchange in Chicago Chicago's operating pretty well. Absent every once in a while there's a hiccup here or there. But I think in its current format with the benefits of the 12 years of create that have been invested Chicago should be okay. The one thing that keep your eye on is if anybody starts altering their plans around interchange for intermodal that could have an impact. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. In response to Allison\u2019s question earlier you gave some anecdotal examples about share gain from truck into the merchandise business at kind of a micro level. I'm just curious do you guys track the opportunity and conversion impact at a macro level? Is this something that you think over the next year to really kind of adds points to either overall growth and merchandise growth in aggregate? Lance Fritz : Beth? Elizabeth Whited : We're certainly always watching what is moving out there in the transportation world and what we think is convertible to rail either from truck or barge or some other mode of transportation. So clearly we're using that as a business development tool all the time. What I would say is I think that those tend to be basis of some sort. They don't tend to be home runs those conversions. So we have to pile up a bunch of them to move the needle. But that's what we're here to do and the team's actively looking on that over time. Bascome Majors : Okay. Well I appreciate that. And you also made some comments about feeling pretty good about the supply, demand balance and your pricing power in the domestic intermodal market looking out beyond this year. Do you think your pricing in the domestic business can be better this year than this year at this point just given how the market's progressing and we were able to price this year's numbers? Elizabeth Whited : Well, I'm not sure how to answer that. I think if you keep having tight supply obviously that's going to allow everybody to be in an environment where you can achieve hopefully two things : volume growth and pricing growth. The way we calculate our numbers as people have told you is somewhat backward looking. So some of the impacts from the ability to get pricing that we're doing right now you're going to continue to see as you go out over the next several quarters. Bascome Majors : Thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. And thank you all for joining us this morning and for your questions. We look forward to talking with you again after the end of the third quarter in October. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

LLC Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the following presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Tom Lischer, Executive Vice-President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018 or $2.15 a share. This represents an increase of 33% of net income and 43% in earnings per share when compared to 2017. This was an all-time quarterly record for Union Pacific even without the benefit from corporate tax reform. Total volume increased 6% in the quarter compared to 2017. Premium and Industrial carloadings both increased 9%, while Agricultural Products grew 2% and Energy volumes were down 2%. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.7% which was flat with the third quarter of 2017. Higher fuel prices had a 0.3 negative impact on the operating ratio. Strong top-line growth was offset by an increase in volume-related costs, higher spending due to some lingering network inefficiencies and other cost hurdles. While we've reported solid financial results, we did not make the service and productivity gains that we had expected during the quarter. However, we believe that Unified Plan 2020 along with other G55 and Zero initiatives and recent changes to our leadership team, position us well to start driving larger service and operational improvements going forward. We launched Unified Plan 2020 on October 1 in our Mid-American corridor with the goal of creating more streamlined operations on the eastern one-third of our network. While early, I am pleased with the initial results, as we have seen improvement in several key performance indicators on our network. We've also made a number of other changes to drive near-term productivity savings that you will hear about today from the rest of the team. Our entire Union Pacific team is fully engaged in the implementation of Unified Plan 2020 and our pursuit of running a highly-reliable, more efficient network. There is much more to come as we continue to roll-out Unified Plan 2020 across our network, and I'm excited about the opportunities it's going to create for both our customers and our shareholders. I'm confident we have the right people and the right plans in place to improve our operations, to provide more reliable service for our customers and achieve industry-leading financial performance. The team will give you more of the details on the third quarter and Unified Plan 2020 starting with Ken. Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Lance and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was up 6% driven by strength in our Premium, Industrial and Agricultural business groups with the partial offset in Energy. We generated positive net core pricing of 1.75% in the quarter with continued pricing pressure in our coal and international intermodal markets. The increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 10% increase in freight revenue. So now, let's take a closer look at the performance in each business group. Ag Products revenue was up 6% on a 2% increase in volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were up 2% driven by strong exports, predominantly shipping to Mexico, coupled with increased domestic demand resulting from lower corn prices. These gains were partially offset by persistent weakness in wheat due to reduced U.S. competitiveness in the world market exports. Grain products carloads were up 6%, driven by sustained demand for ethanol and other bio fuels. This renewable fuel strength, coupled with increased meat production, also drove an increase in shipments for animal proteins. Fertilizer carloads were up 5% due primarily to continued strength in export potash. Energy revenue increased 1% for the third quarter as a 2% decrease in volume was offset by a 2% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and coke volume was down 3% primarily driven by contract loss and retirements, coupled with lower natural gas prices which fell 3% versus the third quarter 2017. Sand carloads were down 23% due to the impact of regional sand and market decline in the Permian Basin. Furthermore, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments which was the primary driver for the 40% increase in petroleum, LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter. Industrial revenue was up 13% on a 9% increase in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 10% primarily driven by strong market demand for rock and cement and favorable year-over-year comps due to Hurricane Harvey that impacted the Texas Gulf in the third quarter of 2017. Likewise, plastics carloads increased 14% due to the same favorable third quarter comps resulting from the hurricane and strength in polyethylene shipments with increased production. Industrial chemicals volume increased 14% due to the continued industrial production growth. Premium revenue was up 18% with a 9% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 7% driven by continued demand for tight truck capacity and strength in parcel and LTL shipments. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over-the-road conversion and production growth at key locations. International intermodal volume was up 12% as new ocean carrier business continue in the third quarter, coupled with strong import and export shipments. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% due to strong truck and SUV sales, increased production at UP third plant and growth with new customer wins. Although the start was down 1% for the quarter, the light truck segment was up 7%. Looking ahead, for the rest of 2018, our Ag Products growth continues to face uncertainty in the export grain markets from foreign tariffs. However, we are seeing some positive indications in the market due to crop issues in South America and other countries, which has made U.S. grain more competitive in the world markets. We anticipate continued strength in biodiesel fuel and renewable diesel fuel shipments due to an increase in market demand for renewable fuels. We also expect tight truck capacity combined with the value of rail to continue our penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and beverage business. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spread to drive positive results for petroleum products, but tough year-over-year frac sand comparisons coupled with local sand supply and softer market conditions will impact sand volumes. We also expect coal to experience continued headwind for the remainder of the year, and as always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand. For Industrial, we anticipate upside in plastics as production rates increase. Metal shipments are expected to grow due to strong construction in energy markets coupled with tight truck capacity. In addition, we anticipate continued strength in industrial production which drives growth in several commodities. For Premium, over-the-road conversions from continued tight truck capacity will present new opportunities for domestic intermodal and auto parts growth. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate growth year-over-year for the remainder of the year resulting from new business wins. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 17 million units, down 1% from 2017. However, production shifts and new import business will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand. So, before I turn it over to Tom for his operations update, I'd like to share a few observations on the progress we are making commercially as we put Unified Plan 2020 into action. We are working very closely with customers to lower our car inventory levels and remove excess cars from the network. This includes both private and system equipment. In the near-term, we plan to make adjustments to our advertorial charges to incentivize greater car and asset utilization across both our carload and unit train networks. More importantly, we are and we will continue to critically evaluate every carload on our network to determine if it fits into our operating strategy at the right margin. In closing, I'm really proud of how our commercial team is communicating with our customers at every turn and in some cases having difficult conversations with them. We are proactively engaging our customers so that ultimately we can provide them with a safe, reliable and mutually efficient service product. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Kenny and good morning. I'll get started with a quick update on our safety performance for the first three quarters. Our reportable injury index was 0.77, an improvement of 1% compared to last year. The reportable rate of our rail equipment incidents or derailments was 3.20, increase of 8%. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate was 2.66, an increase of 6%. I want to note that although we have a tremendous amount of transition and change happening with the implementation of Unified Plan 2020, safety is still job one. Our goal is that all of our employees return home safely each and every day. That goal has not, and will not change. So that's a quick update. Now, let's turn to the changes we are making as we implement UP 2020. As I noted in last month's conference call, Unified Plan 2020 is fundamentally an implementation of precision schedule railroading principles in a manner that fits our network and the needs of our customers. It is a change from operations that shifts from focus on moving trains to moving cars. The plan changes are designed to increase car velocity resulting in reduced locomotive and car dwell. In addition, to improve equipment cycle times, the plan is also designed to better balance our resources across the network. The outcome is a more simplified network that improves reliability for our customers while reducing operating costs and investment requirements. We're about one month into implementation of the Mid-America corridor. To level set everyone, the Mid-America corridor, as the map on our slide indicates, encompasses large north-south traffic flows on the eastern end of our railroad and about 50% of our daily carloads touch this corridor. Our progress thus far; in total, we anticipate more than 150 design changes to our transportation plan on this corridor alone. And we are well on our way to implementing those key plan changes. I am pleased and encouraged with the initial results. In fact, let me give you a few concrete examples that represent the types of changes we are making. For one customer on our Little Rock service unit, we changed where we build blocks of cars and how we move those blocks to the destination. As a result, we have significantly reduced the freight car dwell and their cars are now arriving at destination up to three days sooner. Another customer on the North Platte service unit now pre-blocks cars at their own facility. As a result of all this change, the cars are now bypassing UP's origin switching yard altogether eliminating 24 hours to 36 hours of terminal dwell and providing the customer an overall faster transit time to destination. In other instances we have adjusted train schedule frequency to better balance our resources and smooth customer demand. These adjustments improve asset utilization by establishing a more precise schedule across our network, reducing the number of locomotives and crew starts required to manage the business. I want to point out that in all of these cases, we work closely with the customers to end up with a win-win solution. We were able to improve operational efficiency for Union Pacific and service reliability for the customer. And although we have made dozens of these types of changes in a short period of time, we are just getting started. There is more to come. As we implement the UP 2020 operating model, we will begin to focus on new performance indicators or KPIs. These KPIs will align with the operating goals we are trying to achieve and our financial targets. We are in the process of evaluating some of the appropriate indicators at different levels of the organization, and for the operating functions. However, at a high level, the measures on this slide are appropriate KPIs to gauge our progress as we implement UP 2020. For each measure, we are showing a pre-unified plan baseline for September, the current value and our goal for the end of 2019. I want to note that the 2019 goals are not the end state These are interim targets as we implement the Unified Plan across our network next year and as we continue to supply and refine PSR principles beyond 2019. To begin with, freight car velocity is measured in daily miles per car and is consistent with the focus moving from cars versus moving trains. Operating inventory is a subset of the weekly number we publish with the AAR, but excludes cars in storage and cars placed at customer facilities. Measuring operating inventory is appropriate as it will decrease as we successfully increase car velocity. Cars per carload brings together car inventory and volume, acknowledging that inventory levels will fluctuate with seasonality and as we grow the business. Locomotive productivity is a measure in gross ton-miles per horsepower day. Stated another way, it is the number of gross ton-miles that we move each day for each unit of horsepower in the active fleet. This is an all-inclusive locomotive metric, including shop time. Car plant compliance is a measure of how well we are serving our customer compared to our service schedule. And workforce productivity measures daily car miles per full-time employee and will give us a good indication of how efficiently our employees are working. As I stated earlier, this by no means is an exhaustive list as there are a number of other measurements we monitor on a daily basis. Following the announcement of Unified Plan 2020 last month, I have had some \u2013 there has been some speculation of what we're doing is a light version of PSR, or that UP is not fully committed to making the changes necessary to achieve PSR benefits. I can assure you that is not the case. We do have a planned phase approach to implementation and we are working to accelerate the changes when and where we can. We are also fully committed to the basic tenets of PSR including increasing car velocity, minimizing car dwell, classification of rent reduction and locomotive and crew requirements. This will be achieved through simplifying the rail network and better balancing resources. While our approach may be different, the fundamental PSR operating principles are the same. As our implementation progresses, we expect to realize benefits other railroads have achieved including service reliability, labor productivity, better asset utilization and reduced fuel consumption. And we have started to see some positive results. Since the beginning of August, we have removed over 625 locomotives from the active fleets and we have line of sight for another 150 locomotives to take out of the network by year's end. On the previous slide, our car operating inventory has come down 6,000 cars since September, and we currently have action plans to reduce this inventory by about 10,000 more in the near term. On the TE&Y front, our September workforce was down 2% versus August on flat volume. While I realize it's only one month, the numbers are moving in the correct direction. We are encouraged by the initial results considering the impact of most of the 150 plus service changes that I spoke of earlier are just beginning to be felt here in October. I'd like to highlight some of the changes we're making in our operational organization as a part of the Unified Plan 2020. Just this week we announced the consolidation of our operating regions from three to two. As a part of the regional consolidation, we are also reducing our operating service units from 17 down to 12. These changes will better align our management structure and decision-making processes with the new operating model, providing more speed and agility as we implement the Unified Plan. In addition, we are closing our locomotive repair shop in South Morrill, Nebraska in January 2019. As we begin to implement the network design changes, car flows and traffic patterns will shift. As a result, we are working through a terminal rationalization process. Further, in an effort to streamline two-way communication with our customers and drive faster resolution of service issues, we are moving our customer care and support function, including car management, from marketing and sales to the operating department. This realignment will be crucial in our initiative to reduce operating car inventory. Additionally, we are in the process of consolidating and restructuring our Engineering functions to drive better accountability and increased productivity. Finally, we are making some near-term reductions in our management workforce beyond reductions related to the consolidations and closures I described. These reductions will occur in the fourth quarter of this year and we expect additional workforce reductions as the Unified Plan is implemented into next year. Wrapping up, we are building new culture here at Union Pacific that will enable successful implementation of the Unified Plan 2020. We're off to a great start and I am confident that we will complete the full year implementation of our plan late next year. In fact, we are about to begin the next phase of implementation on our Sunset Route which is earlier than we anticipated. As we make progress across our network in coming months, the result will be a simplified network that operates more safely, with greater reliability and efficiency. I am excited about the changes taking place and I am encouraged about the early results. Change is never easy and there will be challenges along the way, but I am confident that our talented and motivated team is up to the task. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Thanks, Tom, and good morning. We'll start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.9 billion in the quarter, up 10% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 6% increase in volume were the primary drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.7 billion, up 10% from 2017. Operating income totaled $2.3 billion, a 9% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $48 million compared to $90 million in 2017, and as a reminder, third quarter 2017 results included a large land sale in the favorable settlement of a litigation matter. Interest expense of $241 million was up 34% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher debt, total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense decreased 39% to $483 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of the corporate tax reform, partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.3%. For the fourth quarter of this year, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid 23% range. And going forward, we now expect that our normalized tax rate in the future quarters will average around 24%. Net income totaled $1.6 billion, up 33% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 7% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce an all-time quarterly record earnings per share of $2.15. Our operating ratio of 61.7% was flat with the third quarter of last year. And as a reminder, last year's workforce reduction program and Hurricane Harvey had an unfavorable impact of 1.1 points on our third quarter 2017 operating ratio after adjusting for the change in pension accounting. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.3 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017. Freight revenue of $5.6 billion was up 10% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $482 million, up $255 million when compared to 2017 and up $70 million versus the second quarter of this year. The negative business mix impact on freight revenue for the third quarter was 2 full points. Decreased sand volumes and an increase in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments drove the mix change in the quarter. Core price was 1.75% in the third quarter. Pricing continues to be a challenge in our coal and international intermodal markets, and excluding coal and international intermodal, core price was 2.75% in the quarter. For the full year, we still expect the total dollars that we generate from our pricing actions to well exceed our rail inflation costs. Turning now to the operating expense. Slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Comp and benefits expense increased 2% to $1.3 billion versus 2017. The increase was driven primarily by volume-related costs, network inefficiencies and increased TE&Y training expenses, partially offset by lower management costs as a result of our workforce reduction program that we initiated last year. For the full year, we still expect labor and overall inflation to be under 2%. Total workforce levels were up about 1% in the third quarter versus last year. Employees not associated with capital projects were up approximately 2%. The increase was driven by our TE&Y workforce, which was up 8% due to higher carload volume and more employees in the training pipeline. Partially offsetting the increase in our TE&Y workforce was a 6% reduction in management employees and employees performing capital project work. Fuel expense totaled $659 million, up 46% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 5% increase in gross ton miles were the primary drivers of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our average fuel price increased 34% to $2.38 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate also increased during the quarter by about 4%. While there was some adverse impact from mix, the predominant driver of the increased sea rate was the service-related challenges that we experienced. Purchase services and material expense increased 3% to $632 million. The increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, higher prices purchase transportation services and increased locomotive and freight car repair costs. Turning to slide 22, depreciation expense was $547 million up 4% compared to 2017. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 4%. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $272 million in the quarter, which is down 1% when compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower freight car and locomotive lease expense, offset by increased volume-related and network congestion costs. Higher equity income in 2018 also contributed to this favorable year-over-year variance. Other expenses came in at $287 million, up 25% versus last year. The primary drivers were an increase in environmental costs as well as higher state and local taxes. For the full year 2018, we expect other expense to up about 10% compared to 2017. Productivity savings yielded from our G55 and Zero initiatives were largely offset by additional costs as a result of continued operational challenges. The impact of these operational challenges, total just under $50 million in the quarter, which is down from the $65 million that we reported in the second quarter. The additional costs were primarily in the compensation and benefits cost category, although purchase services, fuel and equipment rents were also impacted. Looking forward, we expect our G55 and Zero initiatives, including Unified Plan 2020, will not only eliminate these failure costs, but will put us back on track to achieve significant productivity savings in 2019 and beyond. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations through the first three quarters totaled $6.4 billion, up about 18% when compared to last year due primarily to higher net income. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $24.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, up about $5.3 billion since year-end 2017. This includes the $6 billion debt offering that we concluded in early June, partially offset by repayment of debt maturities. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 2.3 times. And as we mentioned at our Investor Day, our new target for debt to EBITDA is up to 2.7 times which we will achieve over time. Dividend payments for the first three quarters totaled $1.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2017. This includes the effect of three 10% dividend increases over the past year, including the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first and third quarters of this year. We repurchased a total of 44.7 million shares during the first three quarters of 2018, including 2.2 million shares in the third quarter. This includes the initial 19.9 million shares we received as part of a $3.6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in June. We expect to receive additional shares under the terms of the ASR as the program reaches completion before the end of this year. Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $8.7 billion to our shareholders in the first three quarters of this year. Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect solid volume growth to continue in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect volume to be up in the low to mid-single digit range versus 2017. We will yield pricing dollars well in excess of our inflation costs. With respect to capital investments, we expect full year 2018 spending to be around $3.2 billion or about $100 million less than our previously announced $3.3 billion plan. Previously we guided to improvement in our full year operating ratio compared to 2017. While we believe this goal is still achievable, we are starting to see some risks. Implementation of Unified Plan 2020 in the Mid-American corridor is on track, however, we continue to see elevated levels of spending even as our service metrics slowly improve. While volume growth is still strong, we are not seeing the normal seasonal ramp-up in our export grain business due to tariffs and foreign competition. We have therefore challenged the entire organization to accelerate productivity gains by ramping up our G55 and Zero initiatives and these actions are now starting to gain traction. And as Tom just stated, we have removed over 625 locomotives and over 6,000 cars from our network since August 1. We are simplifying our operating leadership structure by eliminating one of three regions and five of our 17 service units. We have announced the closure of our South Morrill locomotive shop and we are working through a terminal rationalization process. We are taking steps to reduce our management workforce with approximately 475 positions being eliminated by the end of this year. In addition, another 200 contract positions will be eliminated. This is the first of what will likely be additional reductions as we continue to drive productivity within our management workforce. While we are confident the actions that we are taking will produce near-term results, the timing of these initiatives may not support an improved operating ratio performance in 2018. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect to get back on track making significant progress reducing our operating ratio and driving toward a 60 OR by 2020. While we expect positive volume growth and core pricing increases to be major contributors to our operating ratio improvement, productivity gains will play a key role. Unified Plan 2020 will be implemented across our network with the first phase expected to be completed by the end of this year and the following phases by the end of 2019. As we make progress in the coming months, we will see lower costs. Although we haven't finalized our financial targets for 2019 and many aspects of Unified Plan 2020 are still being worked out, it is not unreasonable to expect that we should yield at least $500 million of productivity in 2019. We will see this productivity in the form of lower compensation costs as well as savings resulted from operating smaller locomotive and freight car fleets, including equipment rents and purchase services, materials and supplies and fuel. While we have not yet finalized our capital spending needs for 2019 at this time, we do expect investment dollars to be less than 15% of revenue. We will continue to provide periodic updates to our financial goals and guidance as we make further progress implementing our G55 and Zero initiatives, including our Unified Plan 2020. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Rob. As we discussed today, we delivered record third quarter earnings per share driven by strong volumes and solid top-line revenue growth. While we recognize that opportunities still exist to improve our network performance, we are encouraged by the progress that has been made so far. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the strength of the economy and the positive impact on most of our business segments. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the recent progress we've made on our Unified Plan 2020 will accelerate in the near-term. As we move forward with the implementation, along with other G55 and Zero initiatives, we will regain our productivity momentum and improve the value proposition for all four of our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks, operator. Thanks for taking my question, everybody. Just a follow-up on the $500 million of productivity next year, so that it translates to maybe a little bit more than 200 basis points of margin. Given our revenue forecast, at least, I'm not sure \u2013 it's always been hard to kind of translate productivity numbers for the rails into maybe a net savings number and more specifically, how do you contemplate the risks around the frac sand outlook as silica is ramping up in basin Permian mines? I think they've taken up 12 million tons and maybe another 10 million tons to 15 million tons to go. So just given the contribution margins of those carloads, what's the impact to productivity savings next year if those volumes basically go away? Thanks. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Amit, as I said \u2013 this is Rob \u2013 as I said in my comments, we've not finalized for 2019. And all the issues and challenges and questions that you've asked are clearly in the process of us working through and we are not prepared to give guidance on all those items. All I'm calling out here is that we are feeling confident in the early innings of our traction that we're gaining with our G55 and Zero initiatives and most specifically, our Unified Plan 2020. And as we look at that, we know there's going to be \u2013 we think there's going to be a positive volume environment, but exactly what that volume looks like and what the mix looks like and how sand or other commodities turn out remains to be seen at this point. But despite all that, all those moving parts, we think we'll be able to drive at least $500 million of productivity from the initiatives that we have well underway right now. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Maybe just one follow-up on the CapEx, because you did provide maybe a 2019 framework for that at least under 15%, if I look back several years, the company has spent on average almost double depreciation levels and I think that's generally the case with the rail sector as a whole. It is not the case with almost any other industrial sector that's even capital-intensive and even has long-life assets. So I was hoping you could help me understand that. Cost inflation, I don't think explains it fully. There may be some opportunity \u2013 I wonder if you should be much more efficient with the cost of CapEx projects because it does seem the sector as a whole, not just you guys, but the sector as a whole, there's just a lot of money that's being left on the table with respect to efficiency of CapEx projects. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Amit, I think you're right. I mean, I think the rails \u2013 and I think the simple answer or the short answer to why is the capital spending in the rail industry is so much greater than depreciation, really the answer lies largely, I think in the long-lived asset investments that are contained within that investment. So there's a lot of moving parts there, but that really is the simple answer. But I will tell you, as we look at Union Pacific's capital spending, we haven't finalized for 2019, but you're right. I did call out that we're tightening our guidance to be less than 15%, and I'm very proud as we've worked over the last several years to be as disciplined as we can in driving the improvements we've seen in our operating ratio over the last decade or so and more to come. We've been equally focused on being disciplined and thoughtful and lined up around being disciplined around our capital spending, and we were proud to kind of walk that down as we have over the years, and we're just walking it down as a percent of revenue even further as we look to 2019. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Do you think there's an opportunity to get it to 13%, 14% where CSX is today, or is that just a little bit too low given the growth opportunities you're seeing? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Well, stay tuned. I mean, we'll see. Again, I would say that it depends on a lot of factors, but I would tell you that we're as disciplined as we can be around our capital spending. So we'll see. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate the answers. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Two questions. Tom, you mentioned the change from the test phase to now if you go back to when you were just starting this, and you saw some changes necessary. How do you tell if it's working? Looking at the stats, some of the KPIs, cars per carload or Trip Plan Compliance seem to have gone, I guess against what you would have thought given the early changes. And how quickly can you make adjustments as you go through the plan? Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: So, our railroad is going through a lot of changes right now. On the metric side, that's not the primary reason for the failure, of course, you might have seen before. We see improvement as we turn the assets quicker that could create capacity, which is going to improve our reliability and ultimately go out to the efficiency side. It's difficult to say or parse out what part of our improvement is due to the Unified Plan versus other initiatives that we have. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. But to your question, Ken \u2013 this is Lance \u2013 clearly, it's very early innings, right? We've just started implementing Phase 1 on October 1. What we're very optimistic about are seeing movement in some of the KPIs that we would consider the first early indicators like car terminal dwell. We're seeing that move in the right direction. We're going to see and are seeing locomotive productivity as we're taking locomotives out moving in the right direction. That car Trip Plan Compliance, that has a lot of moving parts to it, and it's hard to move it early, right, because it's a combination of what are you doing to and from industry, which is first and last mile, what are you doing in the terminals, what are you doing over the road. And so, the fact that it's treading water right now, I don't think that's unusual or unexpected. But, over time, we do expect that to move in the right direction. And then, the other part of your question is how quickly can we make changes. This is turning into a way of life for us. So, while the phased implementation of the first iteration of Unified Plan 2020 or PSR on our railroad is kind of well-conceived, inside of that, there are already opportunities to try something that's part of that plan. And if it doesn't work out just as thought, reconstructing it and doing it again. That's part of what Tom touched on when he said we've kind of reorganized some of our management structure on the operating side, so we can make those kinds of changes more rapidly. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate that. Just a follow-up, Lance. Your thoughts now on volumes after being up 4% to 6% in the last two quarters, it seems to me, we're going a little slower to get started this quarter. Is that just tough comps? Or are you seeing anything that would suggest a slowing economy from your perspective? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I'm going to start with that, Ken, and I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to give us a little more technicolor. But, I think, overall, there's not many indicators that we see in our served markets kind of broadly that tell us of a global slowdown. Now, there's plenty of risk, right? Chinese tariffs pose a risk and they can disrupt trade flow. We see international economies, particularly Europe looking like they're slowing down a little bit. So, I don't think it's all rosy on the horizon, but we just don't see any specific markers that tell us that growth isn't going to happen. And, Kenny, can you fill in a little bit? Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: Hey, Ken. This is Kenny. First of all, we do have tougher comps in our sand volumes, and so we are seeing less sand moving in that Permian Basin. The other thing that Lance alluded to is on our grain side. We are seeing what I'll call a delay of what could be moving out or exporting out here. And so, we'll watch the soybeans and the grains and keep an eye on that. Now, having said all those things, I'm bullish and the commercial team is bullish that we have some areas that we're expecting to grow into the quarter. Our petrochem business will grow. We're expecting the wins on our international intermodal sector to grow. So, we're still feeling that it will be in the positive. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good luck with the plan. Appreciate the time and thoughts. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities : Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to talk about the plan and how that could impact both volumes and pricing going forward. How do you envision that as you start improving service to the customers? Is this a volume grab? Is this going to be your ability in some areas to increase pricing in some of your products considering that your core pricing even excluding some of this other stuff still seems to be lagging some of your competitors? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So, I'll start with that, Jason, and then, I'll pass it on to Kenny and Tom for their thoughts. So, the way we think about this plan and the impact on volumes and pricing is first our approach to pricing is not changing, and that is the business has to be re-investable, it has to be attractive to us from a margin perspective. Now, there's a new filter put on that as we implement this plan, and that is it has to fit within the network that we've designed. If you go back, one of the \u2013 not one of the, the single biggest prompt for us to switch how we're designing our transportation plan, is that the way we had been doing it resulted in many different boutique services that became very complex to execute and as a result, weren't feeding what the customer wanted broadly which was consistent, reliable service. That's why we're making this switch to Unified Plan 2020. It will generate consistent reliable service as we focus on car movement and focus more of our attention on moving in the manifest network versus boutique unit train networks. And so that the net effect is there is another filter we put on price or on business, and that is will it fit into the network as we've designed it. In terms of the volume side, as we produce a more consistent reliable network, that should generate more opportunity for us from customers. I anticipate that's going to be the case. I don't know exactly when that shows up, and between here and there, there are probably risks to the volume which are customers that either are concerned about the way we're designing their transportation plan and want to try other alternatives; or customers' businesses that don't fit well with the existing plan and they want to try other alternatives. So, with that, Tom or Kenny, you got any other observations? Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: Just real quickly, Lance. You hit on everything. I'll just say I've been really impressed with the commercial team, because they have been out early and proactively talking with customers about the transportation plan that we're implementing, and I can also tell you that as we look at the business, we are putting that filter on to make sure that it does fit with our network. In some cases, there have been a couple of examples where we have elected not to support the business because it does not fit into the network. So, if you're asking the question, are we prepared to walk away from business if it doesn't fit in the network, then that answer is, yes. But like I started off saying, we're really focused on trying to grow our volumes by educating our customers. Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities : That was good color. And sort of as a follow-up to that, on your \u2013 you mentioned you have \u2013 you're doing some terminal rationalization plans, you're closing out locomotive repair shops. So it's starting to look more like, I think some of what investors expect from precision railroading. I was just curious, have you guys brought anybody from the outside in on a consulting basis for this program? Or is this all being done internally? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: So I'll take a stab at that and then Tom might be able to give a little more detail. So, when you think about the expertise that we have in-house on PSR, we do have employees, some at high levels like a Cindy Sanborn who is now going to be running the entire northern region of the network, along with others, particularly in the operating team and also in the network planning and optimization team who have experience and in some cases deep experience in PSR. Now having said that and understanding that we have complete confidence in the existing team and they're doing a hell of a job, both designing from ground up, because it's not being done in Omaha, it's being done by the people that have to execute the product on the ground. We are always looking for ways to increase our knowledge. One way is we have spent a great deal of time with railroads that have implemented PSR to understand from their perspective what worked, what they wished they would have done differently, what they wish they would have accelerated during their initial phases. So we have learned from that and it's reflected in our own planning. And we are always out in the marketplace looking for talent that can add to the team that we have got. Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities : Okay. Thank you for the time as always. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. First question, just wanted to first clarify your 10% labor productivity target for 2019. Does this roughly mean a 10% spread between head count relative to volumes? And what volume growth are you assuming for 2019? And if volumes are weaker than expected, can you still get to 10% labor productivity? Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Rob, can you handle that for us? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. You're referring \u2013 on the 10% \u2013 I would not take that as an overall head count. That's an efficiency measure on that slide that Tom showed earlier. That's not saying that we're going to have 10% fewer head count. What will dictate what the actual head count number is, is productivity is a big piece of it, obviously, but so will volume. So that did not contemplate volume, which at this point we think will be volume growth. So, there's a lot of moving parts on that. I think the message there was that's one of the key KPIs from an operating standpoint as we roll-out Unified Plan 2020 that labor efficiency around running an efficient operation is something we expect to improve upon. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: And we put those percentages plus/minus out as order of magnitude what we're expecting to achieve. Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. And my follow-up also on labor, how many contractors do you currently have on the network, and how much do you expect to reduce them by as part of the Unified Plan? Thanks. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: That's a great question. We don't know \u2013 well, we don't have the numbers handy right now as to the total number of contractors on the network. I'll just remind you that not every contractor looks the same. So, we said we are in the fourth quarter taking out 200 contractors. Those are very much focused in the IT world where they work full-time on projects that we give them, and they're supervised by somebody else in a different part of the world. We have many other contractors that do different things on our property, because they can do it either more effectively than we can or because the asset investment to do the work doesn't make sense for us to make because it wouldn't be deployed all the time. So, in that case, you think about something as simple as snow removal and grass cutting, and then you go all the way up to contractors that are running some of our intermodal ramps. So, there's a lot of moving parts there. You've targeted properly, Ivan, that that is an opportunity cost, and to the extent that we can find low value-added work or ways to do that more efficiently, that's another bucket of costs that we're targeting. Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Wanted to start with one on pricing. On core pricing, could you just talk about what drove that deceleration sequentially? I know you've discussed pressures in coal and international intermodal for a while, but even if you strip that out, we saw a deceleration of about 25 basis points. And then, looking ahead on pricing in 2019, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but you said pricing gains in 2019, but you didn't specify above inflation. So, could you just talk about your expectation for pricing relative to inflation in 2019 as well? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Justin, this is Rob. Let me start with that, and Kenny will probably give a little bit more of a sense of what he's seeing in the market. Number one, you know how \u2013 I'll repeat for you and everyone else, how we calculate our price, which I'm very proud of and we've done for the 15 years since I've been CFO, and that is conservatively calculated on an all-in yield basis. So it's not a same-store sales kind of number. It's an all-in yield. And that's a very conservative way of looking at it, but I think it's a most accurate way of looking at what did you really take to the bottom line from your pricing actions. And I would say that as you look at the difference between our 1.75 all-in reported this quarter versus the two that we reported in the second quarter, it's kind of splitting hairs. There wasn't really a big change because of the rounding mechanics is part of it, but also the way we calculate price, volume is a factor. As a simple example, if we take a 10% increase on a piece of business and the volume is down, we yielded fewer dollars. So we don't count that as a 10% increase. We count that as whatever the dollars that we actually yielded. And so mix, which played against us this quarter, mix clearly was a factor in the conservative way that we calculate price. Looking to 2019, as you know, Justin, we're never going to give precise guidance on absolute pricing numbers. But to your point, I can tell you that we do expect it to be above inflation dollars. I mean, so the dollars that we yield from our pricing actions in 2019, we are just as confident as we head into 2019 as we were in 2018 that those dollars will yield above our expected inflation dollars. Kenny, you want to...? Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, you summed it up good, Rob. I will say, Rob laid out our methodology, and we've moved less sand revenue sequentially third quarter versus the second quarter which had an impact. But having said all of that, if you look at some of the other markets, I'm really pleased and impressed with our ability to price to the market. You look at some of our markets like our domestic intermodal market, you look at our carload business, that's right in competition with truck, very pleased with our ability here to walk up the pricing to price to the market. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. So, really said another way, outside of mix, you would say the pricing environment is stable or better than it was last quarter? Is that fair? Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: That's a good way to look at it. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And as my follow-up, maybe to ask the productivity question a little bit differently, how volume dependent is that $500 million goal for next year? There seems to be more concern in the market about the macro environment and the cycle for both industrials and transports. If we make the assumption the freight environment weakens in 2019, do you still think this productivity target is achievable? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Hey, Justin, this is Rob. I mean, as you know, we're never going to use and haven't used the lack of volume as an excuse for not achieving productivity. Having said that, clearly positive volume is our friend because it gives us more optionality operationally to squeeze out productivity. But as we look to 2019, again, we are thinking that in our \u2013 well, we haven't finalized it yet, our early look is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger and that certainly is embedded in our more than $500 million productivity. So depending on what actually plays out, I will assure you if volume were down, which is not our outlook, but if volume were down, we would just as aggressively go after that 500 plus number, but absolutely what it turns out to be remains, we'll see. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time today. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Okay. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, just wanted to go back to, I think slide 14 on the metrics and the perspective and the goals are helpful. But just to get some sense of the benchmarking, the network performance has been challenging for some time as you mentioned. So where are these key metrics relative to when the network was a little bit more fluid? And can you give us a sense of how these were benchmarked against your peers operating PSR to the extent you're able to get that sort of detail, recognizing this is not an end game, the 2019 numbers you had, but just \u2013 can you put some perspective on how that looks versus UP network maybe a year or two ago and then also your peers would be helpful. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, so this is Lance. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Tom. So parsing that question out, the first thing to note is some of these KPIs are KPIs that we have not tracked historically, and it would be a real job to kind of create them from a historical perspective. So, we're not likely to invest that time. That sounds like time not well spent. Some of them we can track back historically like locomotive productivity or car dwell. And if you look at just overall \u2013 and those are published numbers, certainly car dwell is. You can see that some of our best car dwell was way back probably about the 2013 kind of number or timeframe. But car dwell for us, depending on how we design the network, ranges maybe at best 26 hours plus to in the 30 hour plus range when we're congested. As we looked in the second quarter, one of the reasons that our inefficiency costs were reduced in the second quarter was that through the second quarter, we turned a corner. And we didn't choose September for any reason other than it's essentially the first month before we started in earnest implementing Unified Plan 2020. So, there's really no magic about using that as a baseline. We chose to use that as a baseline because some of these measures like the crew productivity number based on car miles, the car miles per day, those things were just starting them out, so we figured we'd just start them out in September. Tom, what would you like to add to that? Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: Really, as Lance said, the focus on car dwell minimizing that car dwell, getting the assets quicker helps to drive our service product back up. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just to follow-up on that real quick, the benchmarking versus peers? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Brian, Brian I'm sorry. Yeah, we did and have actually benchmarked ourselves against every other PSR railroad, and we do that periodically against every other railroad. And what I'd say is the target ranges that you see on that metric slide are both engineered, they're derived from the network as we think it will be designed on us, right, because the design is not complete. But we took a very large first step in the Mid-American corridor, and so we have a sense for what to expect in the remaining phases. That's item number one. Item number two we have pressure tested that against what we see in absolute performance and in improvement from starting point on the other railroads. Now, I would remind you there's probably one kind of glaring difference in one way, and that is we're starting the project with an OR in the 62 to 63 ballpark where some of the more immediate implementations have started at a higher OR level. So there's that. But, we also can see where everybody else started in terms of their locomotive productivity, their car dwell, their fill in the blank. And the other thing I would say is, we expect significant as we point out in that slide, significant improvement. We're already starting to see early returns that grow that confidence in it. But every railroad is a little different. Right? We have \u2013 we go over the continental divide. We have some pretty significant rise and fall. That probably means that's going to look a little different than somebody who doesn't. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that, Lance. And as a follow-up I have a shorter, quicker one. You know last time we saw mix in price of this dynamic where mix is a bigger drag than core price, as you calculate it was 4Q of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 was the beginning the last time frac sand market collapsed. So, Kenny, can you walk us through any of the offsets that you might have in those markets? You mentioned petroleum, LPG growth as well as the crude out of the Permian. Are those able to fully offset what you might be facing in terms of mix shift basin sand? Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So, thanks for that question. First of all, I'll just say that there are other shales out there that have a good pipeline of opportunity, and so we are pursuing those opportunities and getting wins there. At the same time, you are aware of the crude oil opportunities that are out there, both out of the Permian and out of Canada. We don't go into a lot of detail. We don't talk about customers. But I can tell you that we have wins in both of those markets, and we feel good about the volume that's coming out there. It won't completely offset the sand, but we feel good about the volume, and we'll see where that upside takes us. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, Kenny. Appreciate the time. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. If I can follow-up again on price and thanks for clarification on price versus mix, but just looking at the continued kind of pressures in the international intermodal business, I'm wondering if there is a possibility at all that you guys maybe pull back on that a little bit, kind of, if that is being a drag to overall returns and then pricing. That's the first question. Second is, Rob, you sounded extremely confident about getting price versus positive dollar price versus mix in 2019. We have seen some of the rail inflation benchmarks really spike going into the fourth quarter of this year. Wondering kind of when you think will that positive price mix spread, is that because you expect that inflation number to come back down again? Or do you think you can get the pricing to more than offset inflation if it's like 4% or 5% next year? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Rob, you want to take that price versus inflation? And then, Kenny will... Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Ravi, let me just state, first of all, at the outset, that \u2013 when this ties into your question and the previous question, that we never give guidance on mix. And I have always viewed it as a huge advantage of the UP franchise that we play in so many different markets that there's a lot of mix moving parts, and there is mix within commodities, and so there's a lot of moving mix things which is why we don't even attempt to try to project that or guide to it. We play the hand that the economy deals us. But I will assure you that commercially and across the entire organization, we are focused on driving price where we can on every move, whether it's a positive mix or a negative mix when you add it all up, it might be a short haul move, for example, but we're just as focused on driving price and margin improvement on that short haul move as we are a long haul move. So I wouldn't take mix as implying price is my point there. Number two, to your question on the spread versus inflation, let me just step back and give you the guidance that we have given and that is that our dollars that we yield from our pricing actions will be greater than the dollars that we expend on inflation. So you're right. I would expect at this point that inflation will be higher in 2019 than we have seen in 2018. But the dollars that we yield from our pricing actions should still exceed \u2013 may not \u2013 I'm not saying by what gap, but it should still exceed the dollars that we expend on the inflation cost, albeit inflation likely be a little higher. Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: And, Ravi, I'll be pretty succinct here. Each commodity market is different. Each deal, each customer is different. I can tell you when you see us win in the marketplace, it's at acceptable margins. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And just a quick follow-up. I think on the slides you had listed coal as a headwind going forward. I'm a little surprised to see that, because I think our team internally at least expects supportive natural gas pricing at least for the rest of the year, if not into 2019. Can you just talk about \u2013 can you just remind us kind of what is the kind of baseline breakeven point you would expect to see on natural gas and kind of where do you think that goes in 2019? Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So, first of all, there are a number of things going on in play there. Natural gas prices were down 3% kind of year-over-year by the quarter. There are some retirements in there. There's a book of business on the coal side that's always coming up for renewal. And as I mentioned in my earlier statement, we lost some business. So we're not going to get every win there and we focus on the ones that we win have to be at acceptable margins. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Rob, I wonder if you could talk about the $500 million and help us understand how we should use that for modeling and maybe how it compares to prior levels of productivity. I'm just trying to think about how much of that $500 million we should be expecting to drop down. I'm not looking for specific guidance on what the earnings number is going to be next year, but as you think about the way you measure productivity in the past, how much and how effective has that number been in terms of dropping down to the bottom line? And how does the magnitude of $500 million compared to maybe the last couple years run rate? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. That's a great question. In this year, we have been working through the failure cost or the inefficiency costs that I talked about, so this year is not a good benchmark, but I think it helps inform and influence and set us up for a strong year in 2019 because we have every expectation that we're going to remove those inefficiency costs that we've seen throughout 2018 and then do way more than that with the Unified Plan 2020. So it's a big number. I can't tell you how to model other than we're showing confidence in our ability to drive productivity and as we've stated here, we're confident that our belief at this point, the early planning phase, is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger and we're just as confident as ever on our ability to drive price above inflation. So, from a modeling standpoint, you'll have to kind of take those parameters and do what you think the economy is going to look like. But I would say that the $500 million, and again I said at least $500 million, is a big number. I mean, you can look at \u2013 historically, maybe if you went back over a long period of time, you'd see UP in the $250-ish million kind of range. So we think $500 million in any one year plus is a big productivity achievement. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks for that color. And maybe, Lance, just as a quick follow-up, in looking at the rails over the years, it's always seemed to be conventional wisdom that the franchise at UP is great, the traffic mix, the length of haul, the business foundation which the network is built is really, really good. As you guys are going down this path of precision scheduled railroading, is there any reason to believe that maybe you can't do better than other implementations have been based on the quality of the business franchise? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I think the best sum for that, David, is we anticipate we should be the best performing railroad exactly for the reason of our franchise and team and many other assets and we should have the best financial performance. That's what we're targeting. That's what we're shooting for. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And as you think about sort of executing against that vision with the board's kind of direction, is that where you're pushing the organization and you're willing to make the changes that you need to make to get there? Like, I'm just trying to get a sense for that level of commitment, if you could just comment on that. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: I believe we've shown a appropriate level of commitment in this first month, if you will, of activity. Consolidating regions, consolidating engineering functions, moving something like customer care and support from marketing and sales into the operating team, finding 475 jobs that we think can be done more efficiently, streamlining the organization. There are many first steps that are literally just first steps. And, yes, that level of commitment necessary to ultimately achieve a 55 operating ratio at some point in the future, that is in place. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, thanks for working me in here. Not to beat a dead horse on the operating targets, but I thought it was interesting with the KPIs that you laid out and roughly a 10% productivity improvement ratio on those between now and the end of 2019. If we want to track this with the data that's publicly available to us, and kind of measure your progress in more real-time, what would you suggest we look at? I mean, clearly if you're successful, the OR should improve as you go down this path. But what could we look at weekly or monthly that you would point us to? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So, you see a couple of those KPIs that are currently published, terminal dwell is one that will be a good one to watch. That's a good overall indicator. We publish a freight car number. I think it's a big more inclusive number, but that should show some movement as well. And the other thing to note is, those KPIs are now being built into how we monitor our business and we will have an opportunity to review them with you on a quarterly basis as well. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. And that's actually a really good segue into my follow-up. Lance, after some changes last year to your incentive plans, right now, it looks like the senior management is driven by a combination of operating income and operating ratio with some ROIC targets driving the longer-term incentives. Based on your discussions with the board around your new operating strategy over the last few months, is this the right incentive package to drive outcomes you're looking to achieve with the new operating plan here? And I guess, if the answer is, no, we might tweak that, how might things might look differently from incentive standpoint next year? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. That's a great question, Bascome. So we do believe at this time that our current incentive packages are appropriate and driving appropriate behavior and it's for this reason. In the big picture, if we think about what's important in this \u2013 in our industry and our company, first and foremost is making sure we get our investment and invested capital right, that from that perspective, I mean spend it at the right time, at the right amount, in the right place, and generate the returns necessary to attract capital. And so, the long-term plan being built around ROIC makes all the sense in the world, right? We're a very capital-intensive company and we got to keep an eye on that. We've modified that so that the management team gets punished or rewarded incrementally based on relative performance on operating income. So that's a relative operating income. So that's an important long-term incentive plan. I think it looks right. The short-term is built on two big measures. One is operating ratio, which is how efficiently we're taking the top line and translating it into the bottom line. That's critically important for us. And operating margin, which is \u2013 or operating income again which is are you growing, and are you growing as expected. So, for right now, we think those make sense. But the other thing to note is our Compensation Committee of the board is always evaluating what are the right incentives and how do we align management with what makes best sense for rewarding shareholders. I think we've got that right, right now, but that does change over time, and it could change in the future. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I think you mentioned earlier, or gave an example of bypassing classification yards. So just wonder if that means we should maybe expect a rethink of the hump yards and maybe if I could ask it this way, how many cars per day does one of the hump yards need to process in order to justify the economics? And how many of your top 10 classification yards meet this threshold? Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: Well, I appreciate the question, Allison. As I referenced, we are going through a terminal rationalization process. That is a part of our function as the traffic levels or traffic shifts through our new programs and our new plan. As far as hump yards or switching yards, we're looking at what cars specifically need to be there and assessing if those cars \u2013 if we could shut down that facility and become more efficient with surrounding areas. As far as the hump yard goes, they vary a little bit, but a thousand cars-ish at a hump yard is what we're looking at from a rationalization process, but it's going to be predicated on how the traffic flows end up in our organization. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Allison, I wouldn't use that as a hard and fast rule, right. You know that I think hump yards are very different around the network. Some of our hump yards are designed to run at 2,000 plus cars a day and some are designed to run at 1,200 cars a day. The end game really is if the cars need to be switched and need to be switched there, is that the lowest cost option and if it is, we'll keep using it. And if we get to a point where utilization drives an alternative decision, we'll do that. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's helpful. So maybe the number per day isn't the only focus, and mix and interchange and that sort of thing may play a role. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Basically where you have to switch the cars, that will dictate and because one of the things we're doing is, we're reducing the times we touch a car, which is great overall, but we still have to touch it somewhere to get in block. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Just based on what you're seeing or sort of the high level view of all the yards, does it seem like there is a fairly significant opportunity to consider shutting down some of these yards? Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: We are working through that process right now. We don't have specifics at this point. We're working through that. There's not a specific yard we have targeted at this point, but we are looking closely at those opportunities of where the car should be and if there is opportunity to shutter a yard. There will be more to come on that later. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Good morning. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Wanted Rob to come back to the productivity question for a minute and I don't want to minimize the $500 million plus, because it is a big number. When I look over the last three years or so it's sort of been in the range, at least the projection at the beginning of the year has been in the range of anywhere from like $300 million to $400 million plus. So, I guess I wanted to get a sense of if this implies some back-end sort of weighting, I guess, of the program which would seem to make sense just given the fact that you're starting now and it will probably continue to ramp through 2019? Or if there are maybe potential upside opportunities on the productivity side from implementation of the plan? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Chris, I would say that we're not finite enough yet to calendarize that $500 million. But you're right, I mean, we will be ramping as we go in terms of the implementation of Unified Plan 2020. So that likely will have some impact on the calendarization of the $500 million. And again, I would stress that, recall I said at least $500 million. So we're hopefully not going to leave any money on the table here. We're going to aggressively go after all the opportunities and we're feeling good about this. And, oh, by the way, we have to get that kind of number plus in order to drive to our ultimately our 55 OR which we're committed to and driving to getting to a 60 by no later than 2020. So it's going to take this kind of initiative. And so, I guess, I would summarize my answer by saying, we're going to go after that. It's going to be at least $500 million. Likely we'll have some lumpiness, if you will, from quarter-to-quarter or when it actually plays in then we're going to be working through that as we phase in the remainder of the network on the UP 2020. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that color. And then, just one quick one. I appreciate that it takes some time to kind of run through what you think the potential opportunities are and you guys are implementing at. When should we expect sort of a bigger update in terms of what you can get OR-wise both near-term as well as maybe longer term? So, I guess, the short question is when do we get the sort of full set of financial targets based on the program? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, Chris, it's Rob again. I would say that, I mean stay tuned. I'm not promising that we're going to change our guidance, but I would just say that as you know, having followed us for many years, we're not going to slow down to get to our target by the absolute end of the target date. And I use that reference in the 60. We're going to get to the 60 as safely and efficiently and as quickly as we can. But at this point in time, our guidance still is by 2020. That doesn't mean in 2020, but by 2020 is our official guidance on that. And so, we'll update you as appropriate if need be, but at this point in time, that's how we're marching. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. So I appreciate the information you shared in the slides, that's helpful, and the commentary on the Unified Plan 2020. I feel like I'm still a little unclear in terms of some of the things your activity and so forth. Have you kind of come up with the new schedule, and that's part of the 150 changes you've referred to that there is a new schedule on the Mid-American corridor and you're implementing that? Or is that something that you're still kind of doing work and you'll come up with the new train schedule at some point in the future? Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: So, with our 150 different transportation plan changes that we're implementing, about 125-ish of those are completed right now. And we're continuing to move forward. We have implemented the ones that were the quickest and the highest impact. We have just got over last week our sand plan which moved density of these unit trains that would build density over a couple of days to a daily service. That's not without the lumps. We have had some issues of getting that going, but overall, it seems to be making the forward run. This week we started our intermodal plan of running longer intermodal trains up and down the corridor here. So that's just getting started. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So, Tom, I think to directly answer your question. It is a new transportation plan. And what it means is, Tom's team started at ground level with the cars to and from industry, and built from that where is the most efficient place to switch those and do work, what's the most efficient way to advance them deeper into the network to where they want to go or to interchange, and then reconstructed a transportation plan that does that. So, when Tom is talking about the sand plan, in your mind think there's a number of origins up in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and they accumulate cars and they fill those cars with sand over time. And in a unit train, it takes three, four, sometimes five days to accumulate the cars, create a unit train and ship them down. In today's plan, instead we pull cars daily from those origins. We accumulate it into a manifest network and ship them down. What that does is it saves days on car trips. And you expand that into all the commodities and all the customers that we do across the network and that's how you get time savings on car movement and dwell savings in yard. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : So, is that just directionally, is that driving a reduction in train starts and an increase in train length, or not necessarily? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: You know, so the first things to focus on are, it will drive a reduction in the time it takes a car to go from origin to destination on average. It will reduce the time a car is sitting in a terminal on average. It will reduce the amount of locomotive power required on average. I think we'll see some train start impact. It should. And train length, it could also continue to help us grow train length. Those moving parts are a little less clear in terms of ultimately we'll consume fewer crews, because the product is more efficient and reliable. How much of that is because of trains, physical train starts, that's hard to tease out right now. Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: So, a lot of this is about how we're balancing that network one end to the other, A to B, B back to A. That drives efficiency in our \u2013 overall crew starts. So you should see that. That's how we're coming about our crew start team-wise. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just one brief follow-up, the type of approach generates improvement in labor productivity, so you see head count go down then you experience at the railroad. Are you reducing your hiring and is that the training pipeline coming down given that it seems likely you would see some labor productivity and maybe head count reduction going forward? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: We are, yeah. What you said is true. The pipeline for new hires is starting to come down. It was doing that at the tail-end of the third quarter and we anticipate that to continue. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for getting me in here. I know it's been a long call, so I'm only going to ask one. But, Lance or Rob, I guess, as you guys look out and you've committed to keeping CapEx low, 15% of revenue. If we put that in context, if you look at some of your West Coast railroad competitors, some of them have spent that level quite a bit higher, but eventually seen a lot of volume and top line expansion as well. And it's pretty notable that you guys are still below your 2014 peak in revenues. So, I guess, how simple to the plan is developing top line and volume in the network, and do you think it can be done at these lower capital levels? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, great question, Brandon. So bearing in mind that winning in our world is generating growing and highest amount of operating income and cash from operations, so that we can reward our shareholders, attract capital, and put the capital back to high return projects. I think the short answer is, yes. The way we think about capital, we build it up from the bottom, so we don't start with a target number, but that looks to us like less than 15% of revenue, and I think as we get more efficient, what I expect would happen is, we're going to have capital that is physical existing structure, infrastructure available to use. Now, our capital spending might target a little differently. Prior to implementing this Unified Plan 2020, we might have spent in this one area, and once it's implemented we might have work happening in a different area that we would like to either debottleneck or support with incremental capacity. But I don't think that changes overall the net-net large number. And to achieve what we try to \u2013 what we need to achieve, like a 55 operating ratio, attractive ROIC, growth will help, and I anticipate we will see growth because of more reliable consistent service product. But I don't think capital is going to retard us from being able to do that. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I think if I heard you correctly, the priority, though, first and foremost is earnings and returns within the organization? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Our priority is always generating growing operating income and growing cash from operations. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Lance. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So, Rob, I guess, I'd like to come back to the OR shift in terms of your confidence level about an improvement and suggesting that something has changed here that will obviously give you less confidence. What has happened over the last few months that's led you to kind of flag this OR guidance for this year to be at risk? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, that's a good question. And as I pointed out in my comments, we're still focused on eliminating or reducing the risk as best we can. But you're right. We did flag the full year operating ratio year-over-year improvement in 2018 versus 2017 as a slight risk. And I would say, why is that? Well, what we're seeing is the inefficiency cost that we're going aggressively after, we have every expectation that they will be behind us. Certainly as we head into 2019, are still lingering. Some of the revenue shift has not been our friend, notably as Kenny commented, the grain markets have not been our friend. But I'm not going to use that as an excuse as we don't, because volume has still been fairly strong. But that in fact is one of the challenges. And on a smaller scale, some of the costs associated with the right decision to reduce some of the head count, the timing of that we are obviously going to have a little bit of a perhaps a small headwind in the fourth quarter on that. But you add all that up, those are the things that have changed. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Going forward to next year, you gave us the $500 million, but you did not give us an OR. And going back to a previous point, just holding margin constant and then reducing by $500 million productivity after the revenue change should give you around 200 basis points. So, are you effectively guiding to a 61% OR for next year? And if not, where would the math be wrong there in terms of that calculation? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I mean, we're not giving because we're just not to that point yet. We're not giving guidance on a full year operating ratio in 2019. But again, we'll see how it all plays out. We're confident in the $500-plus productivity. At this point in time we do see positive volume. We're confident in our ability to generate price. If you add it all up, I would expect that we will make nice improvement in the overall margins. What that number ends up being, stay tuned. But clearly, we are focused on a meaningful move in the right direction on the operating ratio. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: I guess, where I'm asking is $500 million not equating to about 200 basis points all else equal given your current assumptions? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah, I mean, your math is not wrong. I mean, that just kind of in isolation is a fair statement. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then you came back, Rob, again to sort of reiterate the 2020 guidance. But Lance and everyone here and Tom, everyone has talked about the substantive opportunity that the Unified Plan is presenting. And I'm struggling with why you're not changing your guidance for 60%. Is it that the 60% was no longer achievable and now it's achievable now that you've got a new plan? Or you haven't calculated exactly the impact or got a full sense of what the impact could be? I'm just really struggling with why you would keep the 2020 target given the substantive change that your organization has put forward with the Unified Plan. Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. No, I totally get it, Walter, and I would say that the answer to your question is kind of several things. One is, we are in the early innings of the implementation as we've talked all morning here of Unified Plan 2020 gaining traction and feeling really good about it. So we're feeling very good about that. We haven't changed that guidance, but I would just call out that, I wouldn't read too much into that. I wouldn't read that, oh, jeez, they're not confident because we are confident. But I would just highlight that at this point, that is a by 2020. It's not a end of last day of the year of 2020 kind of thing. So we're going to get there as safely and as efficiently and quickly as we possibly can and stay tuned, I guess, in terms of what kind of pace we're able to make. As we get more innings under our belt with the implementation of Unified Plan 2020, I think you'll start to see and we'll talk more granule, I would expect, about where are we on that path of improvement. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Yeah, thanks. Compared to other rails that have implemented precision railroading, you pointed out that UP already has some really attractive operating ratios probably 10 percentage points to 15 percentage points better than where some others being. But it strikes us that another big difference is the scale whereby your network is a multiple of the size of the others in many dimensions track, miles, power, revenue, volume. Could you please elaborate on what complications this brings especially to those of us that are not railroad operators? Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Sure. I'll start, and then Tom can add additional technicolor. You're right. Our scale is quite a bit different than the other railroads that have implemented PSR. And I mentioned earlier in the call as we've engaged with our peers in those other railroads, we don't really see anything there scale-based that tells us there's incremental risk to us. One of the things we've done is instead of implementing a brand new transportation plan across the entire network all at once is, we broke it into phases. That's a recognition that scale kind of does matter in terms of magnitude of risk, and if our game plan early on was going to break some customer relationships or if we got some aspect of the design wrong or some such thing, we didn't want to do that system wide. We wanted to learn that in a smaller chunk and that informs kind of why we went down that path. But, Tom, is there any other observations you want to make there? Thomas A. Lischer - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. So we've turned our operating model upside down and we want to make sure we're solid on that as we move forward and designing the plan and working with our customers to be proactive to improve that service reliability. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. I'll leave it at that. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks, guys. Just one quick one for me. Rob, you mentioned you have more debt to raise. Rates are moving quite a bit particularly since the Analyst Day. Just given the size of debt that you'll be raising here, these swings do have an impact on the bottom line. Is that something that you're considering if terms of the timeline for raising that next big chunk of debt? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: Yeah. I mean, those are all factors that go into our planning. We don't have anything to announce here, but, yes, I mean I think all of the things you highlight are going to the mix of us determining what's the right business decision to make and when. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So, is that something, I mean, has your expectation moved up maybe in terms of maybe accelerating when we can see that next leg? Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.: No, I wouldn't say. We haven't put a date on that, but I wouldn't say it's materially changed our thinking. We have nothing to update here. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. All from me. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: All right. Thank you, Matt. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions and joining us on this call today. And we are looking forward to talking with you again in January. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the following presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Jim Vena, our new Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Tom Lischer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting record 2018 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.12 per share. This represents an increase of 29% in net income and 39% in earnings per share when compared to adjusted results for 2017. Total volume increased 3% in the quarter compared to last year. Industrial and premium carloadings grew 6% and 9%, respectively, while Agricultural products declined 2% and Energy volumes were down 9%. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.6%, which improved 1.1 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Strong topline growth and improved operating performance drove the year-over-year improvement during the quarter. We launched the Unified Plan 2020 on October 1 of last year to help drive improved safety, service and operations. And I'm pleased to report that we're ahead of our initial schedule and seeing meaningful gains in on-time performance, productivity and financial results. The network design changes we implemented over the past few months have already had a measurable impact. We've eliminated the excess network cost that we previously discussed. Cost savings are being realized by parking excess freight cars and locomotives, by cycling cars faster in our network and by reducing the size of our workforce. We're seeing steady improvement in the key performance indicators we use to gauge progress. As a result, we announced late last year that we're accelerating implementation of Unified Plan 2020, which we now expect to be complete by the middle of the year. Shortly, you'll hear from the team on our fourth quarter results and the status of the Unified Plan 2020 initiative. But first, I'd like to introduce Jim Vena, an old friend, who we just appointed Chief Operating Officer effective last week. Jim's leadership abilities and accomplishments over a 40-year career at Canadian National Railway are well known in the rail industry. Jim will have full authority over all aspects of Union Pacific's operations to implement Precision Scheduled Railroading principles as he leads the next stages of our Unified Plan 2020. We're fortunate to have him as the newest member of our leadership team. I'll now turn it over to Jim for a few remarks. Vincenzo Vena : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. First, I'd like to say how pleased I am to return again to the railroad industry. Union Pacific is a great company with a storied history and an impressive track record of financial success. I'm proud to be part of it. While I arrived only last week, it is apparent to me that Union Pacific is committed to changing its operating model in pursuit of running a safe, more reliable and highly efficient network. I've also observed that there are a lot of talented people here working hard to move the company ahead. There has been good progress made in recent months, improving the number of key service metrics, but we have a long way to go. I plan to spend time right away out on the railroad interacting with employees. In fact, I've already visited the field, and I can tell you, there's a lot of opportunity out there. I'm assessing the status of Unified Plan 2020, both in terms of progress made to date and initiatives that are currently underway. I believe that Union Pacific can become the industry leader in safety, operating efficiency, customer service and financial performance. I know the railroad has a vision in place to get to a 55 operating ratio already, and we will be working aggressively towards that goal. But first things first, Lance, let's break 60. I'm excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. And with that, Kenny, I'll turn it over to you. Kenyatta Rocker : Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the fourth quarter, our volume was up 3%, driven by solid growth in our Premium and Industrial business groups, with a partial offset in Energy and Ag. We generated positive net core pricing of 2.5% in the quarter. The increase in volume and a 2% improvement in the average revenue per car drove a 6% increase in revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business team. Ag Products revenue was up 5% on a 2% decrease in volume and a 7% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 10%, driven by reduced soybean shipment to China. This was partially offset by growth in other feed grain shipment, predominantly to the Mid-South and Mexico. Grain products carloads were up 2% as the same demand for biofuels drove increases in biodiesel, renewable diesel fuel and soybean oil markets. This was partially offset by tariff related challenges in mills and slowing ethanol growth year-over-year. Fertilizer and soil for carloads increased 18% due to a prolonged fall application, coupled with continued strength in export potash. Energy revenue decreased 8% for the quarter on a 9% decrease in volume, while the average revenue per car remained flat. Coal and coke volume was down 6%, primarily driven by a contract changes and retirement. While natural gas prices were higher, it was not enough to offset the volume decline. Sand carloads were down 47%, largely due to the impact of regional sand within the Permian Basin. Furthermore, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which were the primary driver for the 25% increase in petroleum, LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter. Industrial revenue was up 10% on a 6% increase in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 10%, primarily driven by increased market demand for rock shipment. Metals and ores volumes increased 19% due to strength in energy, construction and manufacturing markets. Plastics carloads increased 10%, driven by higher production, coupled with new plant start-ups. Premium revenue was up 15%, with a 9% increase in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 3%, driven by back-to-back strong peak seasons, continued demand for tight truck capacity and strength in parcel and LTL shipments. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over-the-road conversions and production growth at key locations. International intermodal volume was up 21% as the new ocean carrier business continued in the fourth quarter, coupled with a strong pull ahead of shipments due to the 2019 tariff implementation. Finished vehicle shipments were flat. Fourth quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. However, shift in consumer preference from sedans to light trucks and SUV, coupled with stronger shipment levels out of Mexico and growth with winning new customers, enable UP to overcome declines in the overall market. For 2019, our Ag Product groups expect uncertainty to continue in the grain market due to foreign tariffs. We anticipate continued strength in biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel shipments due to an increase in market demand for renewable fuels that will offset headwinds within the ethanol marketplace. We also expect the tuck - tight truck capacity, combined with the value of rail, to support long-term penetration growth across multiple segments in our food and refrigerated business. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. Local sand supply and softer market conditions will continue to negatively impact sand volumes. We also expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019, and as always with coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand. For Industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments, driven largely by additional plant expansions coming online in 2019. In addition, we anticipate continued strength in Industrial production, which drives growth in several commodities. For Premium, over-the-road conversion from continued tight truck capacity, as mentioned with Ag, will present new opportunities for domestic and auto parts growth. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2019 is 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. We will continue to watch the OEMs as they implement their rationalization plans. Consumer preferences driving production shifts and new business wins will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand. Furthermore, uncertainty in the international trade and the potential for slower growth in the U.S. economy could also present headwinds as 2019 progresses. Before I turn it over to Tom for his operations update, I'd like to share that we continue to work closely with the operating department as we implement service changes with the Unified Plan 2020. Moreover, our commercial team is diligently engaged with customers to educate them on ways to better manage their railcar inventories and help them grow their business. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Lischer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. I'd like to get started with a quick update on our safety performance for 2018. Our reportable injury rate was 0.82, an increase of 4% as compared to last year. Reportable rate for our rail equipment incidents or derailments was 3.28, an increase of 12%. In Public Safety, our grade crossing incident rate was 2.69, an increase of 5%. Safety remains our number one priority, and the entire Union Pacific team is committed and aligned to improving these metrics in 2019. Now I'd like to share an update on our Unified Plan 2020 progress so far. Implementation of Unified Plan 2020 began in October. On our Mid-American Corridor, we initiated and cutover approximately 160 changes to our transportation plan, and the results, thus far, are very encouraging. In this corridor, car inventory was down almost 16,000 cars. Car dwell was down almost 4 hours, driving reduction on our total daily crew starts. Other operating measures, such as car trip plan compliance, train departure and arrival performance and car connection performance have also improved. Furthermore, we are well underway of implementing our Phase 2, our Sunset Route, which is L.A. and Chicago and L.A. to our southeast corridors. This phase includes over 200 network T-Plan changes, and over half of these are already cutover. Next week, we will begin on our third and final phase, addressing the PNW in our Northern California corridors. Our goal is to complete the initial implementation of all 3 phases by the middle of this year, which is 6 months faster than we originally planned. Work continues on our efforts to rationalize switching yards, and we will share the results of these initiatives later this year. As Unified Plan 2020 continues to evolve, we expect to see further gains in labor productivity, which will be reflected in train crew and mechanical and engineering work forces. Our - the culture of our workforce is changing as our employees are actively engaged in both generating new ideas and implementing those ideas to our transportation plan. I am pleased with the progresses we have made so far, not only the results but the process we are following. Last quarter, we introduced 6 key performance indicators that we believe are appropriate measures to gauge our Unified Plan 2020 progress over time. These KPIs align our operating goals with our financial targets. Today, we have updated each KPI chart with the current results for the week ending January 22. The chart shows the pre-Unified Plan values from September of last year and the gold bar representing the range of expectations for our performance levels at year-end 2019. The yearend goals coincide with the data that we showed you last October. As you can see, we have made steady improvement. Freight car velocity has improved 9% since September. Operating inventory and cars per carload continued to improve due to faster car cycle time and the reduction in freight car dwell. Moving on to locomotives. Locomotive productivity increased 7% as we consolidated train operations and parked excess power. We have stored over 1,200 locomotives since August, and we expect units in storage to continue to increase. The results of these improvements are a more fluid and a more reliable service product. Car trip plan compliance increased 14 percentage points, and daily manifest service issues decreased 35% since September. As a reminder, the 2019 year-end goals are interim goals as we implement the Unified Plan 2020 across our network this year and beyond. Also, keep in mind the seasonality. Weather events and periodic service interruptions will drive variability in our KPI results. The results for workforce productivity in December are down from September, due - primarily due to the seasonality of carloads, but we expect large gains over the course of this year. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our KPIs, and we expect continued improvement in our operations this year. So turning to capital. In 2018, we invested $3.2 billion in our capital program. In 2019, we are also targeting about around $3.2 billion pending final approval of our Board of Directors. 70% of our planned 2019 capital allocation is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve our safety and resiliency of the network. We will purchase no new locomotives in 2019, although we will continue to modernize our existing fleet. Freight car acquisitions will support both replacement and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in our - in capacity projects on our network where constraints and productivity opportunities exist. We also plan expansions at intermodal ramps and other commercial facilities to accommodate expected growth. Planned investment in positive train control is $115 million, and that's down $43 million from 2018. To wrap up, Unified Plan 2020 is off to a great start, and I'm very proud of the team's efforts. We have made excellent progress in a short amount of time, but we are just getting started. 2019 will be a year full of change, and the results will be a safer, more reliable and more efficient network. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Knight : Thanks, and good morning. Before I get started, as a reminder, our results for the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by two adjustments that we made associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was passed in late December of '17. These adjustments included a $5.9 billion reduction in income tax expense and an approximately $200 million reduction in equipment rents expense, driven primarily by our equity ownership in TTX. Comparisons that I make today to 2017's financial results exclude the impact of these adjustments. With that introduction, here's a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 3% increase in volume were the primary drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, up 4% from 2017. Operating income totaled $2.2 billion, a 9% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $46 million compared to $33 million in 2017. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by additional real estate gains. Interest expense of $240 million was up 28% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense decreased 32% to $462 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of corporate tax reform, partially offset by higher pretax earnings. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.9%. For 2019, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Net income totaled $1.6 billion, up 29% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance decreased 7% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a fourth quarter record earnings per share of $2.12. Our operating ratio of 61.6% was an improvement of 1.1 points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.5 point favorable impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017. Freight revenue of $5.4 billion was up 6% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $488 million, up $195 million compared to 2017 and up $6 million versus the third quarter of 2018. Business mix had a negative impact of 3.5 points on freight revenue for the fourth quarter. Decreased sand volumes and an increase of lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments drove the negative change in mix. And as Kenny already stated, core price was 2.5% in the fourth quarter, which represents a three quarters a point sequential improvement compared to the third quarter. We realized solid pricing gains across most business segments during the quarter. For the full year, as we expected, total dollars generated from our pricing actions well exceeded our rail inflation costs. Now turning to operating expense. Slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% to $1.3 billion versus 2017. The increase was driven primarily by employee severance costs related to our recent workforce reduction, volume cost and wage inflation, partially offset by lower management labor cost. Total workforce levels were approximately flat in the fourth quarter versus last year. Employees not associated with capital projects were also unchanged year-over-year. Our TE&Y workforce was up 4% due to higher carload volume and more employees in the training pipeline. Offsetting this increase was a 1% reduction in management employees and a 2% reduction in our mechanical and engineering workforces. Fuel expense totaled $640 million, up 17% compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices were the primary driver of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our average fuel price increased 15% to $2.33 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased about 1% during the quarter, primarily due to mix. Purchase services and materials expense was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 at $582 million. Higher intermodal contract services were more than offset by lower mechanical repair costs and joint facility expenses. Turning to Slide 22. Depreciation expense was $555 million, up 4% compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year of 2019, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 3%. Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $269 million in the quarter, which is down 3% when compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower freight car and locomotive lease expense, partially offset by increased volume-related costs. Other expenses came in at $221 million, down 8% versus last year. Increased casualty costs were more than offset by insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Harvey and other items during the quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up in the 5% to 10% range compared to 2018. Productivity savings yielded from our \"G55 + 0\" initiatives totaled $65 million during the quarter, which was partially offset by additional costs associated with operational inefficiencies. The impact of these operational challenges totaled just under $20 million in the quarter, which is down from the $50 million that we reported in the third quarter. The additional cost were primarily in the compensation and benefits cost category. Full year productivity totaled $265 million, which was partially offset by $175 million of additional costs related to network inefficiencies. Net productivity savings for the year was $90 million. Railroad operations improved steadily throughout the quarter. And as Lance mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report that we are no longer experiencing the failure cost associated with the inefficient network operations. Slide 24 provides the summary of our 2018 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue increased about $1.9 billion or 7% to $22.8 billion. Operating income totaled $8.5 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2017. Net income was approximately $6 billion, while earnings per share increased 37% to a record $7.91 per share. Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the full year totaled $8.7 billion, up about 20% when compared to last year, due primarily to higher net income. As expected, capital spending in 2018 totaled $3.2 billion or about 14% of revenue. Return on invested capital was 15.1% in 2018, up from 13.7% in 2017, driven primarily by higher earnings. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $25.1 billion at year-end 2018, up $5.6 billion since year-end 2017. This includes the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in early June, partially offset by repayments of debt maturities. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times, up from 1.9 times in 2017. As we have previously mentioned, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times, which we will achieve over time. Dividend payments for the year totaled $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion in 2017. This includes the effect of 2 10% dividend increases in 2018. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares at a cost of $1.2 billion. Additionally, we received 4.5 million shares in the fourth quarter associated with our $3.6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in June. In total for the year, we repurchased 57.2 million shares at a cost of $8.2 billion. These repurchases reduced our full year average share balance by 6% compared to 2017. Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $10.5 billion to our shareholders in 2018. Free cash flow before dividends totaled nearly $5.3 billion, resulting in a free cash flow conversion rate equal to 88% of net income for 2018. Looking at 2019, we expect volumes for the full year to increase in the low single-digit range. And as Kenny mentioned earlier, we should see strength in several business categories, along with uncertainty in others. We will price our service product to the value it represents in the marketplace while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return for our shareholders. We are confident the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives should again well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2019. For full year 2019, we expect overall inflation to be about 2%, with labor inflation in the 2.5% range. On the productivity side, we plan to yield at least $500 million of savings this year. We will see productivity in the form of lower compensation expense, enabled by a more efficient workforce. Labor savings and lower purchase services and materials expense will result from operating smaller locomotive and freight car fleets. Faster asset turns should reduce equipment rents and improve fuel consumption. Regarding our operating ratio, we are pleased with the recent progress that we have made, eliminating operational inefficiencies and accelerating the Unified Plan 2020. These accomplishments, along with the expectation of low single-digit volume growth in 2019, gives us increased confidence that we will reduce our operating ratio more quickly in the near term. Therefore, assuming the economy cooperates, we are setting new operating ratio guidance for 2019 of a sub 61%, and we expect to be below 60% by the year 2020. The plans and guidance that we established last year for capital spending, capital structure and use of free cash flow remain essentially unchanged. We will continue to appropriately reinvest in the business to maintain and improve the condition of our infrastructure. We will invest capital to support growth and productivity initiatives that meet our cost of capital threshold, and we expect return on invested capital to grow. As Tom mentioned earlier, we plan to spend around $3.2 billion in 2019 on capital expenditures, which is flat with 2018. Longer term, we expect capital investments to continue to be less than 15% of revenue. After capital expenditures, we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, maintaining our target payout range of 40% to 45% of earnings. We expect to take another step forward to increase our debt-to-EBITDA ratio towards our ultimate goal of up to 2.7 times, while maintaining a minimum credit rating of BBB+ and Baa1. The amount by which we increase our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2019 will depend on the strength and stability of both the economic and financial markets. We will continue with our previously announced 3 year plan to repurchase approximately $20 billion of shares by 2020. This plan is now over 40% complete with the $8.2 billion of share repurchases that we completed in 2018. So to wrap up. Positive full year volume, core pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars and significant productivity benefits will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation and an improved full year operating ratio in 2019. In the longer term, we remain firmly committed to reaching our goal of 55% operating ratio beyond 2020. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered record fourth quarter financial results, driven by strong volumes, solid topline revenue growth and improved operating performance. Looking ahead to 2019, we're going to build on the momentum achieved during the past quarter as we continue implementation of Unified Plan 2020 under the guidance of a leader with extensive Precision Scheduled Railroad experience. We'll continue to pursue other \"G55 + 0\" initiatives as well as we make further gains in safety, service and efficiency. We're optimistic that the economy, the strength of our diverse rail network and improved service performance will drive positive volume growth this year and provide further price improvement opportunity. We remain focused on increasing shareholder returns by making appropriate capital investments and returning excess cash to shareholders through growing dividends and share repurchases. I am confident that we have the right organization in place, with an appropriate mix of UP veterans and new thought leaders, to achieve our goals for the year. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to touch on a few things. One, if we look at your outlook on the pricing side, you said - Rob, I think you said the pricing would well exceed your inflation rate. And you said your inflation rate was going to be about 2%. Do you consider the fourth quarter number well exceeding the rate of inflation that you guys posted? Robert Knight : Jason, yes. I think I'll repeat for everybody else's benefit, how we calculate price. It is an all-in yield number. It's not a same-store sales type of calculation. It's the dollars that we generated across our entire book of business. And so when we say well exceed inflation dollars, we're comparing that dollar, if you will, that we generate across the entire book of business from pricing actions against the dollars that we incurred as a result of inflation. So yes, we did well exceed inflation dollars in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to do that again in 2019. Jason Seidl : Okay. Fantastic. And the next one, shocking, was going to be on PSR. Can we talk a little bit about the pace of improvement? And maybe compare UP's network to some of the other networks that have seen PSR implemented? And is there anything at UP that would cause it to go slower or cause it to go faster? Lance Fritz : I'll start it out, and then I'd like to turn it over to Jim for his perspective and then Tom as well. So the bottom line is we're focused on implementing the principles through Unified Plan 2020 on our railroad. And we see lots of opportunity to improve our car dwell, to decrease inventory, to improve cars per carload, to improve labor productivity across the board. We have benchmarked other railroads that implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading. And with puts and takes, we understand what they're achieving, and some of them are setting up some pretty strong benchmarks for us to pursue. But our focus is getting the efficiencies and the improvement here. Jim? Vincenzo Vena : Lance, so all I can really add is a question. Is there any real difference in the speed? No. There is no real difference. And we're going to do it as quickly as possible to be able to look at every piece of the company to see how we get it to be as efficient as any other railroad in North America. Jason Seidl : Thank you very gentlemen. Jim, welcome aboard. Vincenzo Vena : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, thanks, good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions. So Lance and Kenny, obviously, the regulators have been a bit active here with some increase before the government shutdown. So maybe you can just give your perspective. It seems like they have appreciated the communication that you've had with them and with other stakeholders, but it didn't stop them from launching the inquiry into some of the accessorials and demurrage fees. So maybe just give us an update on that. And whether or not you think, when they come back, if adding two new board members will change how this might play out? Lance Fritz : Brian, this is Lance. So you're absolutely right. The STB has expressed interest in understanding our implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading in the form of Unified Plan 2020 and also our approach to customers and helping them change behavior. We've been crystal clear with the STB in terms of what our efforts are, what our approach is and what the endgame is. And I'll leave it to Kenny to dive a little deeper. He has done a tremendous job being in front of the STB, explaining what we're doing, and then being in front of our customers, explaining what we're doing and why. Now I'll touch just one last base, and that is there are incremental members of the STB being named and now sworn in. And the STB has a very big docket in front of it of proposed rule changes. So we're working very diligently to help the STB members understand, from our perspective, the potential impacts of some of what has been proposed, what better alternatives exist and helping them work through that docket in a good, swift logical fashion. So Kenny? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. So Brian, thanks for the question. I say this humbly, but we've done a really good job of being proactive and communicating and being engaged with the STB. I can tell you that engagement has been very consistent. Lance sent out a letter that will be public on the accessorials. He said that, Monday, we'll be sending out something later this week here in the near term, really just updating the STB on where we are on the accessorials and how Unified Plan 2020 is going. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, maybe on the headcount and the productivity side. Maybe this is for Tom. The KPIs are great. I appreciate the updates, but it looks like there is some seasonality given that the daily car miles per FTE hasn't moved up. You gave the average for December. They're the ones who were kind of the last 7-day moving average. Can you just give us some context as to where these were in the fourth quarter? And how you would expect, especially the productivity, how big of a factor is that in the $500 million of targets - target savings rather you're expecting this year? That would be helpful. Thomas Lischer : So our - on the TE&Y side, our training pipeline is kind of what threw it off a little bit from the actual people side. On a sequential basis, the number is actually coming down from -- for the fourth quarter, ending pretty well in December. That is going to continue moving forward. We're in the early innings as far as the labor productivity goes. So I would just look forward to seeing what happens going forward. With the other side of it, our engineering and our mechanical areas, we've made the adjustments in those labor productivities as we've made - say for example, the locomotives come out, we've made adjustments there. But we are in early innings on that side, and we just see that improving going forward. Robert Knight : Right. This is Rob. If I can just add on to your point on the $500 million or at least number of productivity we expect to generate in 2019. Recall, the goal that we put on that particular KPI of a 10%-ish improvement is what we're focused on. And yes, to get $500 million-plus productivity, you can assume - without precise numbers, you can assume that labor productivity across the board is going to be a significant part of that. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks for all the details. I appreciate it. Robert Knight : Yes. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. And welcome back, Jim. Glad to have you back. I wanted to touch base - just to follow-up on that comment, Rob, maybe on the efficiencies for $500 million, if you can get a little bit more granular and sort of give us a sense of maybe how you think about the net benefit of that as we move into '19. So it sounds like you're lapping some service issues, that $175 million of service from 2018. I'm not sure how we think about that in 2019. And then how we think about the $500 million in the context of inflation and the pricing that you're able to get? So I guess, maybe in other words, how much of that $500 million do you think really is net that drops to the bottom line as you run through the PSR initiatives? Robert Knight : Yes. Chris, I get your question, and I'll probably frustrate you because I won't give as much detail around that, that you're asking. But I do get it. And yes, we are lapping some of those inefficiency costs. And that's why we have the at least $500 million figure out there. So yes, there is some so-called low hanging fruit of some - we won't reincur some of the inefficiency costs that we had primarily earlier in the year. So that's a good guide. But we are where we are. I mean, so we're going to improve $500 million at least off of where we ended the year on a full year basis. And it's going to come across the board. It's largely driven by the efficiencies that we've been talking through the Unified Plan 2020, but it's - every stone is going to be turned over in the organization, not just within operations. So all of that contributes. And yes, we have the headwind of the, call it, 2% inflation in there, but $500 million to the bottom line of productivity is what we're striving to get at least. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, okay. No, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe just turning to the volume side. So there has been some announcements, I think, from a service perspective around the Intermodal business. And you were talking about sort of rolling out some of the PSR work to the Sunset Corridor. I just want to get a sense of, within the 2019 volume guidance, how do you think about Intermodal? Is there some maybe contraction or calling of some less profitable business that's included in that number? And maybe is that -- or is that sort of a variable that could impact the outcome as move through 2019? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. So I'll take that. Thanks for that question. First of all, we have a very positive outlook on our Intermodal franchise, both as we parse out the Intermodal and the domestic side. We're still in the early innings on what all we want to do with the network. Jim, Tom and myself would be working out the team as we look for more productivity and make sure that we have the most reliable, consistent service product out there. Lance Fritz : Yes. I want to circle back, Chris, on overall volumes. So if you look around the globe, you can certainly find spots that cause you concern, right? Europe's slowing down. You can even read some reports that maybe it's ebbing into negative growth territory. Clearly, we've got trade potential impacts with China, both real now and future potential. So those are clear overhangs that we're keeping an eye on. Having said that, we have touched base with our customers and continue to do so. And as we look at the economic indicators in the United States, we still see support for what we consider low single-digit volume growth. And we're poised to be agile if that doesn't happen, but it feels like the U.S. continues to plug along. And so we're prepared for that. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks very much for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So I would guess the productivity guidance you've provided for this year is more back-half weighted as you'll have PSR fully rolled out on the network. So is it possible to help us understand the productivity gains you're assuming in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year? I just wanted to get a better sense of the second [half run rate co] PSR. Lance Fritz : Rob? Robert Knight : Yes, Justin. I mean, we aren't detailing it quarterly, the way you're asking. But I can just tell you that we're not sitting around waiting for the back half of the year to come. We're going after it. As you heard both Jim and Tom and Kenny talked about earlier, we're going after it now. And we feel like we finished 2018 with pretty good momentum. So without giving details of precisely how much it's going to show up in each quarter, I can tell you that I don't view it that way. I look at it as an opportunity in front us. We're going to go after as much opportunity on the productivity front as we can. Lance Fritz : Yes. You've seen the numbers, whether it's year-over-year or what we talked about middle of the year to now, locomotives, year-over-year, that number is down 1,200. A number like that from peak to now is down about a couple of thousand. I mean, we are entering the year on pretty good front-forward posture. Justin Long : Okay. That's helpful. And just to clarify on the guidance for a sub-61 OR this year. Does that assume $500 million of productivity? Or does it assume something higher than that? Robert Knight : Yes, Justin, this is Rob. It assumes the economy cooperates. It assumes that we generate and we see positive volume, although we won't use volume as -- lack of volume as an excuse. But our assumption is positive volume on the low single-digit side. It assumes pricing dollars generated above inflation dollars. And it assumes at least $500 million of productivity. So all of that has to be -- we're counting on all of that. We're going after every one of those aspects. Justin Long : Okay. And I guess, lastly, for Jim. Congrats on the new role. And I wanted to circle back to some of the longer-term OR commentary. I'm guessing, given your limited time at the company, your input on the targets, thus far, has been pretty limited. So is it reasonable to expect that after a quarter or two of getting out on the network, seeing the railroad, we could potentially revisit this 2020 target and maybe put some numbers around the timing of getting to that 55 longer term? Vincenzo Vena : Well, thanks for welcoming me, Justin. But you knew I was not going to answer that question. I've been here for 10 days. It's pretty hard to say how much of the railroad I've seen have been out in the field. I'll tell you this much. There's opportunity out there. There's opportunity in how fast we turn the assets from locomotive cars. There's impacts to engineering. But what I'm really happy to see is the whole team, before I showed up, was working towards an improved service, improved assets, improved speed, all the things that count. So we're going to do, as a team, everything we can to do it as fast as possible without truly affecting service to the point where we're affecting the customers that pay the bill every day. Justin Long : Okay, great\u2026 Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Lance Fritz : Morning. Scott Group : Before I really get going, Rob, can you just quickly quantify the insurance and severance items in the quarter? Robert Knight : Yes. The insurance recovery that I called out was in the neighborhood of $15 million, call it, $0.01 EPS. And the severance was 20 - roughly $25 million. Scott Group : Okay. Helpful. So Jim, welcome. And I'm not sure exactly how you're going to answer this based on how you just answered that last question. But UP has told us that they think structurally, they should have the best margin of any railroad. Given sort of your background and history, do you agree with that? Vincenzo Vena : Thanks, Rob. So you guys have already got out that we're absolutely the best. Listen, Scott, seriously, there is nothing holding back from what I've seen from before and where I've been on-site from the franchise and what we can do. There are some things that we can do real fast short term. And there's others that we're going to have to target some capital in places to be able to run the trains and the cars as quick as possible, and we'll do that. But I don't see any reason for us to push against the best in the industry. Do I realize that - and I know some of those people in the other railroads. There's no way Keith is going to make it easy. There's no way JJ is going to make it easy. And there's no way Foote's going to make it easy. So we're going to work hard to see what they have -- we can do to be in the same ballpark and play the same game. Scott Group : And when we've seen precision railroading at past railroads, it has been associated with closing hump yards and yard rationalization. Do you think we'll start to see that from UP? Vincenzo Vena : Everything is on the table. So I visited a hump yard last week, and there is no ifs, ands or buts. We have opportunity. So everything. Flat yards, hump yards, there is nothing that's not on the table. And I'd be remiss to say, listen, we're going to shut down x amount of yards with 10 days on the job. But we're going to spend a lot of time to make sure we get the plant set up to handle the business as efficiently as possible with great service. So that's where we're headed. Scott Group : Okay. Thanks, guys. Vincenzo Vena : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Great job on a solid performance in accelerating the plan, Lance. But Kenny, maybe you can delve into kind of what kind of changes have you already launched with customers in changing how the business is run. Can - any examples you can give us on things that have changed as you roll out PSR? Kenyatta Rocker : Sure. Thanks for that question, Ken. So first of all, what we've done is we've been very proactive with our customers and we've been very granular with them on the changes that we want to make. So specifically, we tell them exactly what will happen. We talk to them about when and then we talk to them about what they can expect, and so we've done that at every turn. We've also sat down with our customers and talked to them about how to have the most efficient supply chain in terms of what we're trying to accomplish from a rail perspective. As Tom mentioned earlier, we've had quite a bit of a decrease in our rail inventory. A significant part of that is on the private cars fleet, and a lot of that is because our commercial team has been proactive in working with the customer to let them know how to run an efficient rail service with us. Lance Fritz : Yes. And Kenny, those conversations haven't been easy, right? So customers aren't just immediately embracing the conversations you're earning with them. But your team is doing a tremendous job helping them understand how they can change their operating processes so that they receive better service net-net overall. Kenyatta Rocker : Yes, that's right. Ken Hoexter : Great. Appreciate that. And then if I can get one in for Jim as well. And Jim, welcome. But what - from your perspective so far and kind of how Lance has described, he stressed a lot about what fits our railroad in precision railroading principles. And given your background at your prior firm, what is different? Maybe you can explain to us from your perspective in the way Union Pacific has previously talked about PSR principles versus the precision railroading we saw. And then your thoughts on how that relates maybe to headcount reduction or timing of that? Vincenzo Vena : Well, Ken, nice to hear your voice again, so thanks for welcoming me back. So I don't think there's anything different, substantially different. The network can be a little bit different. The customer, payers can be a little bit different. But the end result for PSR is pretty simple. You want to have great service. And I'll admit it right upfront, there's always -- and Kenny knows there's going to be some noise on the way there. There's -- and when you are more efficient in how you turn the locomotives, you need less of them. You need less people to service them. And I could go through a long list to tell you. I don't see anything major difference. But I'll let Lance talk about if there's really that much structurally different, and I think that's what it is, structurally we're a little bit different than the railroad I used to work at. But at the end of that, the principles are you run a real efficient railroad to the point where, down the road, we'll be able to attract new business because we're more efficient that we were not able to attract at this point. Make ourselves more competitive at every place where we competing, not only against railroad but against trucks. So it's a real positive. And the quicker we can get to that efficiency, it just helps us drive the bottom line in this company to a new point. So that's what we're doing. Lance Fritz : Amen, Jim. Ken, I think you shouldn't read too much into - and I've said this over and over. When I talk precision scheduled railroad principles, it's Precision Scheduled Railroading. It's all the things that build it done the UP way, which just means at right speed, engaged with customers, and you're seeing how we implement it in full. So it's not like a piece here, a piece there, and I think we've been crystal clear about that as well. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate that and the time. Thanks, guys. Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to, Jim, ask you, in previous iterations of PSR, the shedding of marginal traffic across the entire book not just intermodal. The resulting disruption of traffic flow seemed to allow Hunter to halt the system and redesign it very quickly, like we saw at CSX and CP. And it doesn't seem like we've really seen that so far at UMP, and I'm not hearing that from you guys today. Maybe that's due to the fact that the STB is keeping a pretty close eye out on the customer impact. But in your experience, is shedding business a necessary part of this process in order to fully realize the benefits of PSR implementation? And if you don't think so, I'd be curious to hear any thoughts on why maybe Hunter did it that way? Vincenzo Vena : Well, Allison, thanks for the question. First of all, too early for me to say what impacts and what the efficiency will do to the business that's out there right now. I'd be truly guessing, and I don't like to guess. But if you have everything on the table, you need to deal with the flows of traffic, how well it fits into the plan to be efficient. And other places that have done PSR or scheduled railroad before, there has been some impact. But it's a logical decision to go through. You try to do it as little as possible. But at the end of the day, you got to be smart enough to move ahead and operate the railroad in a very efficient manner. So Allison, sorry, I just can't give you any more than that. I'd be guessing, and that's not what I'm doing. Kenyatta Rocker : And then, Allison, this is Kenny. I just want to say we're working together as a team, Tom, Jim and I, to really educate the customer on how to fit in our network. I can tell you, we're not going in this thing looking to say, hey, we may lose this business because we're shipping. We're going in to win and grow our franchise. Allison Landry : Okay, that's helpful. And Jim, I can appreciate you not wanting to guess. And then I wanted to see if you may be able to elaborate on the comments you made that perhaps you'll target some capital to be able to run the trains as quick as possible. Can you give us some sense of what that could relate to or maybe an example? That would be helpful? Thanks. Vincenzo Vena : Real quick example from what I'd seen already is we want to build the length of the trains up. The technology is in place to operate the trains at a larger size than we are today and we might have to target some places where we can meet larger trains. And that's where we're going to do, and we want to do that fairly quickly. We want to be able to turn on that. And I Rob's on board, Lance is on board, the whole team is on board. It just makes the place more efficient. So that's an example. Robert Knight : And Allison, I would just - this is Rob. I would just add, of course, all of that will be embedded in the guidance that we gave of less than 15% of revenue as we look. So we'll work -- we might move capital dollar from this project to that project. That kind of decision will -- may be made, but within the overall structure that we've guided. Allison Landry : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Robert Knight : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning and congratulations on the strong momentum at the railroad and also on bringing Jim onboard. Sounds like you got just a lot of momentum, a lot of opportunity. You've - so you've had a lot of questions on PSR and kind of how you're approaching it. You've got your own KPIs. I just wanted to get some thoughts on how you think the review of the train schedule, how we might consider that. I think that's been a key component of schedule railroading at CP, CSX when it was rolled out, running fewer trains, taking train miles out and so forth. Can you offer some thoughts on has that already been done? Is reduction train starts kind of a key component? I know you've talked more about car miles per day, but just if you could offer some thoughts on that or if that's still to come in the future. Lance Fritz : Hey, Tom, this is Lance. So I'll start in outlining for everybody on the call our process of adjusting our transportation plan, which Tom mentioned in his comments, and then give it over to Jim and Tom to add detail. So recall, Tom was talking about the Mid-American quarter, 160 T-Plan changes. In the Phase 2, 200. And we're just launching on Phase 3. So that is - those changes are exactly what you're talking about, Tom. That's about balancing the network. It's about blending. It's about taking what used to maybe be a unit train, but it wasn't efficient as a unit train and turning it into manifest and blending those networks. And then also looking for opportunities to knock off train starts, which ultimately ends up being a productivity tool for crew utilization. So all that - Phase 1 is under way. The process has been for us to bring in from the field the individuals who have to execute the work. We hold them accountable for designing a T-Plan that is highly reliable and efficient, and then they work with our network planning team to make it real. So that's how Phase 1 happened, the Phase 2 happened, it's how Phase 3 is going to happen this coming week. And a little more technicolor, Jim or Tom. Vincenzo Vena : Go ahead, Tom. Thomas Lischer : So we are - to your point, we are looking at train size and the train schedules to maximize footage across the territories that we can operate. Jim alluded to some capital opportunities that we're studying right now to get a quick turn on. But this is going to be an evergreen process as we continue. We're going to continue to look for the efficiencies, not only at the local or the node type area but the line side to drive those efficiencies across the network. Vincenzo Vena : Listen, the only thing I could add and maybe it'll save some of the questions later on. Bottom line is we're going to use less cars to move the same amount of business because we're going to make them run faster. You do that by running them through terminals quicker than we are today, substantially quicker than we are today. You're going to run less locomotives because they're going to get over the road quicker and we'll be able to turn them into terminal. And we're going to be more efficient in how we handle them through the shops and how - even the equipment department, the mechanical people, how they handle the locomotives, how long they're out of service. We're going to go after the engineering people to see how efficient they are with capital to make sure that we're not blowing capital. We don't need to add to capital. We'll use the capital we have to be able to fix the railroad and make sure we've got the most optimal railroad. I can keep on going for a long time. The bottom line, what we want is good service with moving trains with more cars on them in an efficient manner. The locomotives are better. So we're going to touch - we've already touched, and we're going to touch the railroad across the whole company. It's not just one segment. It's exciting, right? There is nothing better to see when this thing comes through. Some of them will be real quick changes that we can make, and we've made changes already. We just dropped -- Tom and I went through, and we dropped a couple hundred more locomotives in the first 10 days. So is there more to come? Yes, there is. But let's be smart about it. So I'm excited. It's fun. And it's not like me going to Tibet or China or something because it's a different -- but this is pretty good in Omaha. I'm enjoying it. Tom Wadewitz : So that all makes sense. And I don't mean to overly focus on one metric, but can you offer a thought on how train starts may have changed? I mean, are they down - what percent they might be down? Or what - or is that - the train start reduction is something that would come later on? Lance Fritz : Tom, do you want to give a little commentary kind of qualitatively on what's happening with train starts? Thomas Lischer : They're moving down, aligned with our expectations. We see some opportunity here going forward in the next couple months. Lance Fritz : Yes, and you see it across the board, Tom. So we're finding opportunity to take manifest train starts down because we're finding opportunity where we have 4 starts between terminals and we really only need 2. And then we're also finding opportunity where we used to run a bulk train once every 2 weeks, and we're just sucking those cars into the manifest network. So we're not going to have that bulk train start and growing train size and the manifest network. We're seeing all of that, and there's lots and lots of opportunity to continue. Tom Wadewitz : Right, okay. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Congrats team. Best of Luck, Jim. Jim, I know you've been at the company for, I guess, 10 days now, including the weekend. But you've been obviously at the rail industry for several decades. And I'm sure you had a good sense before you came in, in terms of what Union Pacific does well and maybe what can be improved upon. And I think you've touched on a few things from an efficiency perspective. But if you can just help us understand the DNA of UNP as you looked from outside in, what they've done well, what you think at least can be improved upon. I think that will be helpful in just understanding the opportunity? Vincenzo Vena : Well, listen, you pass judgment when you look from outside in. It's a great company, great franchise. So it's got all the -- and great people. It really has, and we're going to put some extra focus on operating efficiency. And I think they -- UP has already started doing that before I showed up, so -- which is nice. And they got a great team from -- sitting around the table here with me. We've got strong people from the finance side, the marketing side. So I think it's a great opportunity, great company and we don't want to be where we are. We want to be close to the best of the best down the road, so that's what we're driving for. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, okay. Let me just ask maybe a more specific one for Rob on the comment - the earlier comment Rob made with respect to the OR target this year being predicated on volume growth, productivity growth, just a lot of things that's rolling up into that OR target. But we are in a little bit of a transition period with respect to volume growth just given the uncertainty out there and your own guidance for this year. So Rob, how should we think about how much of the OR improvement is, in fact, predicated on the volume and revenue growth assumptions in the plan? Or is there just so much cost opportunity because you have that at least $500 million productivity target out there that there is enough cushion to say if volume growth is flat or maybe even slightly negative this year? Robert Knight : Yes, no, I get your question. And I'm not going to give you a precise number today. Having followed us a long time, we don't use, as I said earlier, the lack of volume as an excuse to not achieve our productivity. But volume is our friend. So I can't split the hairs the way quite the way you're asking it, but our outlook right now is the economy is cooperating. And our outlook is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger, in the low single digits, and we're not going to stop at $500 million. We're going to get at least that, and we're going to be as aggressive, as you've heard us talk all morning here, and looking for opportunities that we are pretty confident we know are out there and additional ones that no doubt will come as Jim and the team get further engaged. So we're going to go after -- and by the way, we're not just going to stop at -- we're going to get as far below the 61% as we can. So when we say sub-61%, we're going to do as good a job as we can pulling all the levers. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I'm going to ask one more just because I understand the answer, but I guess it wasn't overly precise because you just can't - you're not - you guys can't provide that, I guess, and I understand that. But maybe on the CapEx because you have provided a precise number on CapEx. Now it's a little over 13% in sales. Can you just talk about the filter? Has the filter changed in terms of what's being green lit in terms of new projects? And what's caused that reduction? And all the incremental cash flow, I guess, could that go now back to share repurchase? Would that be the number one use of the incremental cash flow? And that's it for me. Robert Knight : Yes, Amit, this is Rob. And one of the things you've heard me say for several years now, we are very proud about the process that we have as an organization around our disciplined capital spending. So we have a joint effort that heavily involves, of course, operations, marketing and finance to really grind and make sure we're making the right decisions with an eye on long-term reserve - returns when we make capital investments. So we're not starting a railroad. We want to make capital investments. I'm -- as a CFO, I'm the happiest guy in the room to make a capital investment because I know we only do that when the returns justify it. So when you look at it, our discipline process around our capital, I would say that the process has not changed. What may well change, as Jim alluded to earlier, is specific projects here or there, where he sees and the team sees the opportunity to generate strong returns going forward. Those dollars may be redirected to different projects, but the process at a macro level is unchanged. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Thanks, guys. Congrats again and good luck in 2019. I appreciate it. Robert Knight : Thanks, Amit. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Morning, guys. So you guys have made some pretty good progress with the PSR implementation already and it sounds like you're going to be done with it in 6 months. Is there a risk that Jim's full impact may not be able to come through because you're pretty much going to be done with the plan before he gets ramped up at the railroad? Or if Jim does come in and find a bunch of things to do, I mean, maybe that could extend the pace of implementation. Lance Fritz : Ravi, let's be really crystal clear. Phase 1 of implementing this whole thing, when we're doing that in 3 phases, that will be done by mid-summer. This is an evergreen, right? So it's not like one and done, and then we live with that T-Plan and it's set in stone. This is a relentless pursuit of efficiency and enhanced reliability on our service product to customers. And we're never done. So my expectation with Jim is that you're going to be after it with the team with Tom and Lynden and Kenny forever. For -- it's an evergreen process, Ravi. Ravi Shanker : Sorry, Jim, don't put your feet up just yet. Vincenzo Vena : I was just wondering whether you thought - listen, I'm over here just relaxing. So I really appreciate it, Ravi. Thank you very much. Ravi Shanker : No worries. And just as a follow-up, Rob, maybe Phase 1, you're going to be done by mid '19. And maybe this is related to the first question. But can you just talk about some of the items that will kind of bridge the OR gap between the 61% at the end of '19 and 60% for 2020? Again, are those related to PSR? Are those unrelated to PSR items? Robert Knight : It's all of the above. I mean, PSR principles and the UP 2020 clearly will be, I think, a major piece of it. But remember, we've got our \"G55 + 0\" initiatives, which the difference between that and the Unified Plan 2020, really, in my mind is the \"G55 + 0\" initiatives is implied to mean everyone in the organization, whereas Unified Plan 2020 is really heavily operational. But everyone in the company is focused on driving productivity in everything we do. And I would say as we look to the sub-61% to the sub-60%, to your question, it's going to be driving all of the things we've been talking about today. The productivity, the efficiencies that will be evergreen and continue. It will be our relentless pressure and focus on getting as much price in the market as we possibly can. And at this stage of the game, we see positive volume being a contributor as well. So it's going to be all those levers. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matt Reustle : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Somewhat of a follow-up to an earlier question in terms of pricing initiatives. At this point, do you think you're actually driving any shift in mix from customers that are receptive to the pricing terms versus those that aren't? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes, thanks for that question. No, we haven't seen that right now. I can tell you that we're pricing to the market, we're pricing to our value proposition. And as our service product becomes more reliable, we're optimistic about our opportunity to continue to do that. Lance Fritz : And I want to add a little bit to that, Matt. So saying that we're deliberately trying to move mix with price is -- that's probably not precisely accurate. Saying sometimes that happens because when Kenny's team is pushing and trying to get as much as they can for the value that we're delivering, sometimes they break business. And when that happens, it can affect mix. And that - I don't doubt that has happened historically, and I don't doubt it's going to continue to happen. Matt Reustle : Absolutely. Understood, okay. And then, Rob, regarding the $12 billion remaining on the buyback, right now you're running about $3 billion in free cash flow after dividends per year so that leaves a $6 billion gap there. At your current EBITDA level, you could do another $4 billion in debt raise and not breach the leverage targets. So how do you think about bridging that $2 billion gap over the next 2 years? Is it free cash flow growth, is it EBITDA growth? And you referenced it in your remarks. How comfortable are you that you can achieve that if you do see a deterioration in the macro environment? Robert Knight : Yes. I mean we expect to make progress. And we will -- it will all be predicated on how our earnings growth project and how we actually deliver in actuality. And right now, as you can tell from our tone, we're feeling pretty good about that. So I would anticipate that we'll continue to move up the scale, if you will, on the guidance that we've given and continue to make progress on the - completing the buyback, working up towards that 2.7 times that we talked about. We made good progress in 2018. We expect to continue to make good progress in '19 and '20. Matt Reustle : And ultimately, you think there's enough, whether it's CapEx takeout or cost takeout opportunities, where you can still achieve that full $20 billion even if you had an environment where volumes were declining or slowing down in particular areas? Robert Knight : Yes. But of course, we always take a look at what's happening in our business. And if you had a recession or something like that, which we're not projecting, I mean, we obviously take that into consideration. Matt Reustle : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. And welcome back, Jim. My question is around PSR and the implementation that we've seen or terms of implementation that we've seen in the past. And we've seen examples where it was attempted and failed and examples where it was attempted and achieved. And it seems that in those areas where it was attempted and achieved, it was done in a fairly aggressive fashion with a very short time frame that typically resulted in a fair degree of disruption. And that's disruption's at the customer level, the labor level, the regulator level. Mike, where we've seen it fail is where we've tried to water it down a bit and tried not to be as disruptive, and it hasn't worked. What I'm trying to figure out now, which way - what is the risk that we see a, perhaps, adjustment to PSR that puts it - puts the PSR implementation at risk? Lance Fritz : So I'm going to start by saying I'm not sure I'm going to buy into the premise of the question. I'll say Jim can talk perfectly about the experience at CN, kind of the mother ship of the concept. And that happened over a fairly long period of time and continues to happen. So Jim, why don't you share those perspectives with us? Vincenzo Vena : Walter, nice hearing from you. To start off, there's things that you can do real quick. And is there going to be some noise? I give it. Kenny is going to have some noise, but we got to be smart about how we do it so the noise does not affect us both from regulatory or customer. So we have that. But you move fairly quick and you see some advantages. The first few points are easier to drive and quicker. It took us, at the old company, a long time to get the last piece. That's a cultural change with people. It's how people think, it's how people do. So all those things take a little bit longer. And there is something that we find -- as you go through the process, you're going to have to spend capital to be able to extend sightings and tweak things to put it in. And so all that's in the mix. And listen, this whole question about whether we're going to succeed, I'll be honest. I could have just stayed doing what I was doing. I've got income back to sit around and enjoy myself and enjoy Omaha and everything that the network has to offer. I'm here to deliver. The team is here to deliver. We're going to have a lot of fun doing it. It's going to be an exciting time, and we're going to deliver it, Walter. I'm not worried about it. Lance Fritz : Absolutely. And I want to come back to maybe one of the fundamental differences, maybe not, of how we're going about it. And that is Kenny has talked over and over about being in front of the customer, making sure they know what we're up to. That doesn't mean that the conversation goes smoothly and comfortably, but it means that they know. And the endgame is we want them to understand what we're doing, what it takes to fit well in this newly designed network, what those behaviors look like so that the service to them is highly efficient, highly reliable and consistent, which is the endgame. That's what they want. And so maybe that's a stylistic change. It doesn't slow us up, but it does change I think how the customer perceives what's going on. Walter Spracklin : Yes. That makes sense. Okay. Just moving over to pricing. Perhaps, Kenny, you can address. You pointed and highlighted a fairly significant change sequentially in your pricing, a lot higher than I would expect from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Was there any kind of lumpy contracts, resign? Was there the benefit of spot business that -- from the tail end of the trucking? Can you perhaps give us a little bit of color on why that lifted so much? And could we see a continuation of a very significant sequential lift if whatever factors were at play in the fourth quarter continue into 2019? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. So first of all, we still have the competitive forces that we talked about in the past. They're still there. There wasn't anything unique or - that we want to call out. Like I stated, we're just going to continue to price to the market. We're going to price to the value proposition that we have. And a more reliable service product is going to give us more opportunity. Walter Spracklin : So nothing specifically that caused the increase in the fourth quarter? Like, was it - like even - without being specific to different customers, was it just higher renewals? Or any color at all? Robert Knight : Yes, this is Rob. As we said in our opening comments, we pretty much got -- saw positive pricing, except for the areas that Kenny just mentioned, where we continue to face some competitive pressures. We pretty much got good price across the board. So there was no single driver or marquee story line there. It was just steady hard work and good service and it came in at the 2.5. Walter Spracklin : Okay, okay. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Mike Baudendistel : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you, I mean, a lot of the other rails that have gone through PSR had first seen customer service deteriorate before it has later gotten better. Do you expect that to apply to Union Pacific? Lance Fritz : So far, it hasn't, and that's not our objective. Right now, we're making pretty radical changes. And I'm sure you can find some number of customers at UP who could tell you that they're not real happy because we fundamentally changed the service product. Broadly speaking, the networks providing a better service product to most of our customers, and that's our intent. Thomas Lischer : So first, to build on that a little bit, we've seen actually a 35% reduction in our service issues on our manifest program. So where we put in the - our Unified Plan 2020, we rolled that out. We've seen really good improvement in the overall reliability. Obviously, there's more opportunity to get better here. Mike Baudendistel : Great. Sounds good. And also, just wanted to ask you, you said you don't need any locomotives in 2019. I think you've said that before. Is it primarily because you purchased a lot of locomotives the last few years? Or is it because you're running the network more efficiently and you can park some more now because of the existing fleet? Lance Fritz : It's because we have a lot of locomotives in storage right now. We just don't need to add to the fleet. I will remind you, we did say that we're going to continue to modernize some of our heavily used units in the fleet, and that's for an eye towards improving reliability. Reliability of the fleet is really critical as we continue to grind efficiency on the resource. Mike Baudendistel : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning, guys. I had another sort of philosophical question around the whole PSR thing. I think where we've seen this work really well in the past is a very tight integration between sales and operations. In fact, most times, you've had sort of like a President of the business kind of controlling both functions. And it's really a shift from designing operation -- services with operations to the light customers to really selling the schedule that's most sufficient to run. I just wanted to get a sense for how you guys are addressing that kind of tension between sales and operations, either organizationally or through incentives or through business process changes, to make sure that as you are implementing this stuff, you are getting that tight integration that you need between the selling functions and the operating functions to really get the most out of this initiative. So if you could talk to that, that would be great. Lance Fritz : Well, I'll let the guy doing it speak to that. Vincenzo Vena : Okay. So let's think about it. There is going to be some impacts. I keep on saying it, and I'll say it again. From all the questions that we've had, people have said there's going to be impacts, and there's going to be impacts. As soon as you change things, you start charging people the merge for using your car and you make sure you collect the bill so that they give you the car back and they take it on arrival so it doesn't sit in your yard, that's a big change. And we're going to make those changes. We're going to make it quick. The Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Marketing Officer, sorry about that change in title. I apologize. But, okay, they can work hand-in-hand if we have the same goal, which we have the same goal. If there's some tension, at the end of the day, if we all understand where the goal is at the end - and I'll tell you, JJ and I had a great relationship, okay? And there's no reason for Kenny and I not to have the same relationship where we know what the goal is. And we know where there's going to be some impacts and we know there are some tough decisions to make. And I'm absolutely sure that Lance will keep the feet to the fire to make sure that we come to a solution that makes sense. And so that's my two piece. Lance Fritz : That's exactly right, Jim. Thomas Lischer : With the initial implementation, Kenny and I have been a lockstep, having those conversations with the customers. As we make changes, we're very tight on what we're doing as we go forward. David Vernon : So no organizational changes or sort of incentive changes around kind of how you're actually taking the product to market? Lance Fritz : Yes. You've seen our organizational change when we added Jim into the team. And what we did was we took a great team and we made it all that much better, which is why you're hearing confidence from us in terms of what we're going to accomplish in 2019 and beyond. And I'll tell you that we have good robust dissent debate, right, about what should we do in this situation. And the endgame is putting a filter on what it'd take to be the safest, best service product which is most reliable and consistent and most efficient railroad in North America. And those are the decisions that we're going to make. So yes, we fight about it. And usually, it's a fight about which is going to get us faster, which is going to get us more, which is the better path, not should we even take this path. David Vernon : Thanks for that. Maybe, Kenny, just switching gears real quick and a follow-up. In your discussions with steamship customers, are you hearing anything from the steamship lines about how they're going to be adapting their service schedule to North America with the introduction of IMO 2020 later in the year? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. So I was just in [Asia] a couple months ago. Right now, we haven't had any extensive conversations about that, but we're going to stay close to our customers and be engaged with them. David Vernon : All right. Thanks. Kenyatta Rocker : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben Hartford : Yes, thanks. Maybe, Kenny, just a follow-up on the inbound ocean freight situation. Could you provide a little bit of context as to what the present environment is? We're hearing a lot about, obviously, pull forward. You mentioned that in your remarks, the inbound ocean freight. Data into the West Coast has been strong here. Warehouse capacity is tight. So any sort of perspective, particularly post Chinese New Year, as we get into March and the spring ramp what type of activity do we see? Do we see transloading activity and domestic intermodal pick up in a low and - on the international intermodal side? And how much of a volume risk do you see post Chinese New Year given the pull forward that we are seeing at the present time? Thanks. Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. So thanks for that. We definitely saw it in the fourth quarter, as I alluded to in my earlier comments. As we're talking to our largest customers now and as you probably have read in the press release, there's still some strong volume out there, and we do see that. Based on the pull ahead, there's also some of that with the spring deal on the retail side. And we're going to just continue to stay close to our customers to see how volume shakes out. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Thanks, everyone for getting my question here. I know it's been a long call, so I'll just keep to one. But Lance, I guess, if we look back at the recent history at Union Pacific, your other West Coast rail peers have really outgrown, and specifically CN. So I guess - and I feel like Union Pacific has always had more of a balanced plan on margins, pricing and volume. With the transition to more of a scheduled railroad, does this create a lot of opportunities to maybe have targeted expansion with your customers? Or should we be thinking volume is more in the cars looking ahead? Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you for the question, Brandon. So the way we think about it is our Unified Plan 2020 is all about consistent, reliable service, better service, which our customers are starting to see and we're going to grow on that. And the most efficient service, generating the best returns because we do think we should be in the lead or with the leaders of the pack in that sense. I anticipate that customer service product, coupled with the work that Lynden's team and IT have been doing with sales and marketing on the experience and targeted technology investments towards an enhanced customer experience, that makes us more attractive than competition in the marketplace, whether it's truck or another railroad. So I do think, over time, we should have growth opportunity that presents itself to us that we don't have right now. But that's yet to be seen. That's the strategy, and we're intent on pulling that off on implementing that. Brandon Oglenski : Well, thank you. Welcome back Jim. Vincenzo Vena : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Jim, welcome back. First of all, you're coming in as an unquestionable change agent in a very large organization. Clearly, you have a tremendous amount of experience that suggests that this will be a successful foray much like your last ones. But inevitably, some of those decisions are going to be unpopular, and there's a lot of people at UP to object to them. How do you get -- or how did you get the conviction that you had the leeway you need from the rest of the management team and the board to make the tough decisions that you're inevitably going to make over the next couple years? And if you could just talk a little bit about that process and how you got comfort level with taking this role, I think that would be really helpful? Thanks. Vincenzo Vena : Bascome, thanks for the question, and nice to hear your voice again. So when you make a decision to change and come back to work, Lance and I spent a considerable amount of time, and the same thing with Rob and with Tom, to go over and make sure that the vision was aligned with what we need to do to be able to deliver and be able to take this company to where it should be. So at the end of it, I would not have come on board if I wasn't comfortable that everybody -- and it wasn't a push to get them to have the same goals and objectives and understanding what we had to do to get there. So that was the easiest part. So you communicate, talk before. And we both agreed that, listen, it's what the goals and objectives are. I would -- if I was worried about the decision-making with the board and with Lance or anybody else in the company, I would've stayed at home. I would have done something else. I'm not worried about that. And so that was the process that we took, Bascome. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Welcome back. Vincenzo Vena : Appreciate it. Looking forward to the next few years. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Well, thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in April and going over what our progress is at that point. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting record 2019 first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.93 per share. This represents an increase of 6% in net income and 15% in earnings per share compared to 2018. Total volume decreased 2% in the quarter compared to last year. Quarterly operating ratio came in at 63.6%, a 1 point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2018. Severe winter weather and flooding across our network adversely impacted volumes and added incremental operating costs in the quarter. In spite of these headwinds, we still achieved year-over-year margin improvement as a result of our G55 and Zero and Unified Plan 2020 efforts. I am extremely proud of the men and women of Union Pacific and applaud their heroic efforts to safely restore our rail network. Our ability to quickly recover operations after severing the east-west artery of our network is unprecedented. I also want to thank our customers for working with us during these historic weather challenges. With these incidents behind us, our operating performance is rapidly improving, enabling us to provide a safe, reliable, and efficient service product for our customers. We've largely completed our initial transportation plan changes associated with Unified Plan 2020 and well ahead of schedule. But these changes are really just a foundation for the great opportunities we see going forward like our terminal rationalization initiative that Jim will touch in later. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was down 2%, largely driven by weather related hurdles. Volume decline in our energy and ag business groups, with a partial offset in industrial and the premium. However, we still generated positive net core pricing of 2.75% in the quarter. Freight revenue was down 2%, driven by a decrease in volume as average revenue per car was essentially flat. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Starting with Ag Products, revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 7% decrease in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 7%, driven by reduced grain exports to China. This was partially offset by strength in feed grain shipments to our southern region. Volume for grain products was down 6%, predominantly due to weather-related challenges impacting soybean and ethanol shipments. Partially offsetting these declines was the same demand for biofuels and other related products. And lastly, food and beverage volumes were down 10% driven by a mix of weather-related impact, role [ph] reproduction changes, and the foreign policy effects on dry foods and export proteins. Moving on to Energy. Revenue was down 16%, as volume declined 15%, coupled with a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Coal and coke volume was down 14%, driven by ongoing headwind of retirements and contract changes as well as fewer shipments from the Powder River Basin due to the historic Nebraska flooding in March. Sand carloads were down 45%, largely due to the impact of local sand within the Permian Basin. However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 18% increase in petroleum, LPG, and renewable carloads for the quarter. Industrial revenue was up 5% on a 4% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads grew 12%, primarily driven by increased market demand and favorable weather conditions in the South for rock shipments. Plastics volume was up 8% due to higher production. In addition, metals volume increased by 6%, due to the continued strength in the energy, construction and manufacturing markets. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% with a 2% increase in volume, while average revenue per car remained flat. Domestic intermodal volume declined 5% during the quarter, as severe weather negatively impacted service and intermodal terminal operations. Additionally, truck capacity and more competitive truck rates provided fewer opportunities for spot over-the-road conversions. Auto parts volume was negatively impacted by North American auto production. International intermodal volume was up 15% in the first quarter, driven by strong volume from the tariff pull ahead earlier in the quarter, coupled with new business wins. And finally, finished vehicle shipments declined 3%, as first quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 3% from 2018. While light truck and SUV sales were actually up, the offset was not enough to overcome the decrease in car sales. In addition, weather impacted fluidity, creating higher inventory and reduced shipments. Looking forward to the rest of 2019. For Ag Products, we anticipate continued strength in bio shipments due to the increase in market demand for renewable fuels, which will offset the headwinds in the ethanol marketplace. In addition, we expect stronger beer shipments, along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business. Furthermore, we expect uncertainty to persist in the grain market due to the tariff -- foreign tariffs. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. Local sand supply will continue to negatively impact sand volume. We also expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019. And as always with coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand. For industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments, driven largely by plant expansions coming on line later this year. In addition, we expect continued strength in industrial production, which drives growth in several commodities under this business segment. For premium, domestic intermodal volume could be impacted by a softer truck market in 2019, which may limit the opportunities for over-to-road truck conversion. However, longer-term fundamentals still provide a bullish outlook for over-the-road conversions. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2019 is 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. Consumer preference for SUVs over sedans will continue to create some opportunity. We will continue to watch the OEMs as they implement their rationalization plans to their production plants. And finally, for our international intermodal business, we expect volumes to normalize back to seasonal levels. As it relates to international trade, there still remains uncertainty and we will continue to watch the U.S. economy, which could also present headwinds as 2019 progresses. So before I hand this off to Jim, I want to give a shout out to the operating and engineering teams for their tireless effort to get our network back in service from the historic weather events that we've encountered over the past several weeks. Both our commercial and operating teams worked closely together to minimize our impact on our customers, and thanks to our customers for being patient and understanding, while we worked to restore service back as quickly and as safely as possible. And with that I'll now turn it over to Jim. Jim Vena : Okay. Thanks, Kenny, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 11. As you heard from Lance and Kenny, our operations were challenged during the first quarter by a series of significant weather events. Heavy snowfall and harsh winter conditions in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest were followed by widespread flooding that washed out our east-west main line in Nebraska for 13 days. In addition, our ability to reroute the 50 trains per days that normally travel in this corridor was limited due to the widespread nature of the flooding. As a result, fluidity and asset utilization were impacted as we deployed additional people and equipment to operate the railroad. We took some bold actions this time around to help us restore operations. And while impactful to the business in the short term, these actions allowed us to quickly return to normal operations. Our terminals are current and we are moving traffic as presented. The new operating mindset of Unified Plan 2020 is clearly working and I'm extremely proud of our employees who worked safely and efficiently to restore operations. Turning to slide 12. I'd like to now take a minute to update you on the six key performance indicators I am focusing the team on going forward. Despite the weather, nearly all of our metrics improved year-over-year. This is a testament to the work we are doing as part of Unified Plan 2020 to improve network efficiency and service reliability. Our continued focus on asset utilization and minimizing car classifications led to a 19% improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 7% improvement in freight car velocity compared to the first quarter of 2018. Train speed for the first quarter decreased 6% to 23.3 miles per hour as network disruptions impacted fluidity. Turning to slide 13. We improved locomotive productivity 6% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of March 31st, we had approximately 1,900 locomotives stored. And even with a 4% decrease in the total workforce, our productivity was down 2% year-over-year as daily car miles declined 6% in the quarter. In addition to improving productivity, delivering a great service product is an equal goal of the team. Car trip plan compliance improved two points versus 2018 as customers benefited from increased freight car velocity and lower dwell. And we expect our customers to continue seeing a more reliable service product going forward. I know many of you watch our weekly dwell and velocity numbers and how we already noticed our improvement over the last few weeks. Turning to slide 14. The last time I spoke with you I had only been on the job about 10 days. Since then I've spent a lot of time in the field getting familiar with our network and evaluating Unified Plan 2020. As Lance mentioned, we completed our initial transportation plan changes and they are delivering good results. But I will tell you there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us to further improve asset utilization and network efficiency. Slide 14 highlights some of the recent network changes including our initial terminal rationalization results. We stopped pumping cars at Hinkle and Pine Bluff and curtailed yard operations in Salt Lake City, the Kansas City complex and Butler Yard in Wisconsin to name a few. And we continue to look for additional rationalization opportunities. For example, we have multiple intermodal facilities in the Chicago complex, which provides an opportunity to reduce operational complexity while improving our service. We also decided to pause construction of Brazos Yard. The remaining capital dollars planned for Brazos in 2019 will be reallocated to siding extension on the Sunset Corridor and a block swap yard in Santa Teresa, which will add to our network flexibility. These projects directly support our productivity initiatives, which are off to a great start as illustrated by the graph on the right. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length 7% the last couple of months and I expect to see continued improvement in this measure as the year progresses. Turning to Slide 15 and to wrap up. It's been a very busy first 90 days for me at Union Pacific. I'm having a lot of fun, and I'm excited about what's ahead. Our network showed tremendous resiliency in the face of significant weather during the quarter and we're already seeing it in our key operating metrics. As we move forward improving safety, efficiency and service reliability across our rail network, customers will benefit from an end-to-end service product that enables greater supply chain efficiency. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Knight : Thanks Jim and good morning. Before I jump into the results, I thought I would level set everyone on some of the ins and outs that we experienced in the quarter. Unprecedented weather events negatively impacted volume growth while driving additional operating expenses. These weather challenges resulted in a 1.6 point negative impact to our operating ratio and $0.15 earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2018, which I'll detail more in a minute. You also saw the 8-K that we filed in March where we recognized a $42 million payroll tax refund along with $27 million of associated interest income. This refund had a 0.8 point favorable impact on the operating ratio and a $0.07 EPS tailwind in the quarter compared to last year. The combined impact of lower fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a favorable impact for the quarter of 0.9 points on our operating ratio and $0.06 of EPS compared to 2018. Taken together, the positives in the quarter from fuel and the tax refund were essentially offset by the negative weather impact. The good news is that despite the weather challenges, our G55 and Zero and our Unified Plan 2020 efforts drove core operating margin improvement of about one point or $0.27 of EPS compared to the first quarter last year. To give you a little more detail on the weather impact in the quarter, the combination of the winter storms in February and flooding in March were the primary drivers of a 2% year-over-year volume decline in the quarter or roughly $150 million. Although our car loadings are starting to rebound, we do not expect to make up much of this lost revenue with the possible exception of some opportunities in coal and grain. We also incurred around $40 million of weather related costs in the quarter primarily in the compensation and benefits and the purchased services and materials cost categories. Given that we still have a couple of minor outages today, a small amount of cost will likely carry over into the second quarter. And finally, capital expenditures associated with the flooding are estimated to be around $30 million. And now let's recap our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.4 billion in the quarter, down 2% versus last year. The primary driver was a 2% decrease in volume. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion, down 3% from 2018. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 1% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $77 million, an increase of $119 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by interest income of $27 million associated with the previously mentioned payroll tax refund and a favorable year-over-year comparison. And as a reminder, first quarter of last year 2018 those results included a bond redemption cost of $85 million resulting in a favorable quarterly comparison. Interest expense of $247 million was up 33% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense was flat at $399 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.3%. For the full year, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be slightly north of 23%. This is primarily driven by the benefits related to stock option exercises and a recent tax legislation in Arkansas to decrease its corporate income tax rate. And as a result of the legislation, we will decrease our deferred tax expense by $21 million in the second quarter of 2019. Net income totaled $1.4 billion; up 6% versus last year while the outstanding share balance decreased 8% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. As I noted at the start, these results combined to produce a first quarter record earnings per share of $1.93 and a one point year-over-year improvement in the operating ratio to 63.6%. Freight revenue of $5 billion was down 2% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $398 million, up $45 million when compared to 2018. Business mix had a meaningful impact of negative four points on the freight revenue for the first quarter. Decreased sand and agricultural products volumes along with an increase in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments drove the negative change in mix. Core price was 2.75% in the first quarter, which represents one quarter of a point sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 5% to $1.2 billion versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by the payroll tax refund that I mentioned earlier and headcount reductions, partially offset by wage inflation, employee severance costs and weather related expenses. Total workforce levels were down 4% in the first quarter versus last year. Productivity initiatives and lower volumes enabled a 2% decrease in our TE&Y workforce while our management, engineering, mechanical workforces together declined 6%. Fuel expense totaled $531 million, down 10% compared to last year. Lower diesel fuel prices and gallons consumed were the primary drivers of the decrease in quarterly fuel expense. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our average fuel price decreased 3% to $2.07 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased about 1% during the quarter, primarily due to mix and weather impact. Purchased services and materials expense, was down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2018, at $576 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the quarter were reduced mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, partially offset by weather and derailment related expenses. Turning to slide 21. Depreciation expense was $549 million, up 1% compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 2%. Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $258 million in the quarter, which was down 3% when compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower equipment lease expense and less volume-related costs, partially offset by weather-related challenges. Other expenses came in at $305 million, an increase of 15% versus last year. Higher casualty costs including destroyed equipment and freight loss and damage were the primary drivers of this increase. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up in the 5% to 10% range compared to 2018. Productivity savings yielded from our G55 and Zero initiatives and the Unified Plan 2020 totaled $120 million during the quarter, which was partially offset by additional costs associated with the weather and derailments. As a result, net productivity for the quarter was approximately $60 million. With these incidents behind us, we are still confident in our ability to deliver at least $500 million of productivity in 2019. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first quarter totaled $2 billion, up about 3% when compared to last year, due primarily to higher net income. Free cash flow before dividends totaled $1.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow conversion rate equal to 84% of net income for the first quarter. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $27.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $2.5 billion since year end 2018. This includes, the $3 billion debt offering that we completed in February partially offset by repayment of debt maturities. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times, up from the 2.3 times that we reported at year-end 2018. And as we have previously mentioned, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times. Dividend payments for the first quarter totaled $626 million, up from $568 million in 2018. During the first quarter, we repurchased 18.1 million shares at a cost of $3.5 billion. This total includes the initial 11.8 million shares that we received as part of a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in February of 2019. We expect to receive additional shares under the terms of the ASR, with final settlement to be completed prior to the end of the third quarter of this year. Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $4.1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, our guidance for 2019 remains unchanged, which is a testament to our belief that the weather challenges of the first quarter are behind us. We expect volumes for the full year to increase in the low single-digit range. And as Kenny mentioned earlier, we should see strength in a number of business categories, along with some uncertainty in others. Our pricing strategy remains unchanged, as we continue to price our service product to the value that it represents in the marketplace, while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return. We are confident the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation costs in 2019. Although, our planned capital spending is shifting somewhat as a result of the reallocation that Jim walked through, the weather-related capital that I discussed, we will expect capital expenditures to still be around that $3.2 billion range for 2019. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve a sub-61% operating ratio in 2019 on a full year basis, and we still expect to be below 60% by 2020. And our commitment to reaching a 55% operating ratio beyond 2020 has never been stronger. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered record first quarter financial results driven by improved operating performance, while dealing with significant weather challenges. Unified Plan 2020 created a more resilient and robust network, allowing us to quickly return to normal operations. For the remainder of 2019, we look to build on the momentum we had prior to the weather challenges and provide a consistent reliable service product for our customers, while at the same time improving our operating efficiency. We remain focused on increasing shareholder returns by appropriately investing capital into the railroad and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, let's open-up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So Jim, now that you've been here for more than 10 days, it looks like you've been pretty busy going back to slide 14 with the terminal rationalization and network changes. And I was just hoping if you can give us a bit more context as to what could come next, you have Chicago circled here, on the map. You've done what seems like a few hump yard closures. How many more, do you think you can close? How early in the process do you think you are when you look at redesigning service and then maybe making some of these terminal changes? Jim Vena : Well, good morning, Brian. I appreciate the question. And I'll tell you I did not have my feet up on the desk, okay? So there's been a lot of very interesting \u2013 first of all, I wanted to make sure I understood how this network worked. It's very important to \u2013 that you don't make some big mistakes when you're out there trying to change a network. The last place I was at, I worked for 40 years. And after 40 years, you get a real good feel of the way the place is. So this is what I've found so far. And I don't like to put a guess about what I'm going to do. But I'll tell you I think we moved very quick. We got set back with the weather that we had in end of February and the floods that were unprecedented. In fact, I've been railroading for a long time, and I'm impressed with what the team was able to do to turn this thing around and get us back to normal operation very quickly. But \u2013 so what I'm looking at is real simple. It's \u2013 we're trying to take touch points out of the cars. We speed the cars up and you can see what we did first quarter. We rationalized the locomotives, so we don't have excess out there, and we parked a lot of locomotives and are able to handle the same traffic with substantially less. I think there's more opportunity there. We'll continue to do that. In the terminals, we have our eye on a number of terminals that make sense for us. We'll do it through this next quarter. And as we do, we'll do them cautiously. I want to make sure I don't disrupt the service too much to our customers. And slowly, but surely we'll work through this. We're not \u2013 when I'm saying slowly, it doesn't mean that, I'm going to still be looking at the terminals. So, I've got a plan written down of which ones we're going to go after next, and we'll announce them as we do them. Hope, I answered your question, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Yeah. Thanks, Jim. Just as a follow-up and I don't know, if I'm reading too much into this but on the KPIs, which I think are really quite helpful, we don't have the goals there anymore at least from what we had before. So, I just wanted to see if these are still the ones you're thinking of moving forward, if the goals are under consideration. Anything else you can provide around that would be helpful? Thanks. Jim Vena : Brian, listen, year-end goals are important when you're trying to do some budgeting. But for me, this is the way I look at it. So let's take a look at \u2013 look more to productivity up 6%. I was going to blow by the goal real early in the year. So do we want to stop? I don't think so. The way I look at it is there's a lot more left in the locomotive productivity. I'm going to see how fast we can get to the best number that we can the least amount of locomotives to work. I think there's still some action there, and we would have blown by that end goal before the middle of summer. So for me, it's how fast what do we need to do, do it in a smart way, and we'll blow by all the goals we had setup for the end of the year. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Let \u2013 Brian, this is Lance. So, we have not changed any of those goals that we had showed in the KPIs that we had up in the January analyst call. It's just at this point, it looks like there's upside and we're just going to move through to the upside. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Scott Group : So Jim I was wondering if you can help. When we look at the service issues, is there a way you can isolate some of the weather impacts versus maybe some of the natural growing pains that we typically see with PSR? Do you think you're also having some of those? And then maybe more specifically on headcount, can you give us any sort of directional color on how you think about headcount next quarter for the year? I think you had a 10% labor productivity target. Is that also one of the KPIs you think you could to use your term blow by? Jim Vena : Maybe that wasn't the way best way to describe it right, Scott? So let me be more tempered. So, on the labor productivity, we see labor continuing to drop. And it'll drop through the year as we become more efficient in handling our product. So I'm not concerned about it that we don't see adding. We see dropping and will continue to drop on labor productivity. The weather, what was interesting about the weather was just the magnitude of the place. So if you think about it, we talked about the 50 trains a day that we run on our east-west corridor. But it also went down towards Kansas City. We lost sub-divisions. And we still have one of our lines and impact on a couple of others where we're cut off rebuilding a bridge and we're still working around. So there's still some impact today. But nice part is, is we recovered quickly. PSR or when you change things, if I wanted to, I guess, I could have come on and parked 500 locomotives first day and that would have impacted. It takes a while to grow into that. But we're doing it a little smarter. We're down the number that we need to be, but I didn't do it first day. We're doing it strategically. You shut down a hump yard like when Pine Bluff got -- was shut down as a hump operation, it does take a while. And if I would have done three or four of them at the same time, we would have impacted more the network. So we're being smart about it. So that's what we're trying to do Scott. Scott Group : Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe secondly for Kenny. The last couple quarters you guys have been talking about the competitive pricing dynamic with BN, more the same. Is anything changing there? And big picture are you seeing any changes in behavior from BN? Kenny Rocker : Yes, I don't want to get in commenting specifically about another carrier. But I'll tell you the competitive marketplace is still very strong. There's still a lot of pressure. There's a lot of pressure on the trucking side. I feel like our commercial team did an excellent job of pricing to the market. I also feel like as Jim and the operating folks get us back to the reliable service that we saw before the flood and the snow that that's an opportunity for us to price to the value. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey. It's Ken Hoexter. Lance, Jim and Kenny great job showing the resilience of the network. Just Jim on the 1,900 locomotives you parked, is there a need for those to keep around for growth? Or do you go take a impairment charge on those? Can you give some thoughts on the future of your locomotive fleet? Jim Vena : I think both answers. We're going to keep some that make sense. They're good locomotives. And if we have some excess, we're going to return some, we're going to get rid of some, but we're working through that. But Rob maybe you have a\u2026 Rob Knight : Yes. Yes, this is Rob. Yes. I mean we're going to work through that as Jim says and we'll look at it and uncover any opportunity we think we have for our locomotives as appropriate, but there's no imminent impairment charge plan here. Ken Hoexter : Okay. And then if I can just get a follow-up on your normal sequential operating ratio improvement. Can you give thoughts on the cadence as we move through the rest of the year Rob just given the kind of some of the charges in the quarter and maybe what -- if we look at normal sequential, what you've done in the second quarter versus first, but then think about the weather? Just to try to understand your path to get to your full year targets and relationship to Jim's kind of commentary about maybe blowing by certain targets up to that point, but if you can still make up that target or if you -- there's still kind of the ability to beat those prior targets that would be helpful. Thanks Rob. Rob Knight : Yes. Ken, I mean as you know the first quarter is generally a little bit higher operating ratio and that's traditionally true. There was a lot of ins and outs as we walked through in the first quarter. Fuel as an example was a tailwind in that we don't know exactly how that's going to play out through the balance of the year. But to answer your question without giving specific quarterly operating ratio guidance for us to get to our confident guidance of a sub 61% that obviously implies that we're expecting to make great progress, which we all feel really good about great progress from here on out for the balance of the year. Ken Hoexter : All right. Appreciate the insights. Great job on the snapback stuff. Thank you. Rob Knight : Thanks Ken. Operator : Next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask another one on the yards. So obviously you talked about the -- in addition to the two closures, can you talk about whether you have or you're expecting to convert any of the humps to flat switch? And then any sort of sense that you could give us in helping us to try to quantify the potential or improvement or maybe if you could tell us how much of the overall initiative is baked into the $500 million? Lance Fritz : Okay. Rob, you want to start? Rob Knight : Let me see, if I -- I'll take the second part of that question first. And that is without -- again without giving specific numbers, I would just tell you that it is a part. I mean, these initiatives that Jim is talking about and others are all going to be critical contributors to us achieving that $500 million plus of productivity this year. So without giving you a specific numbers, it is a part of that. And of course, as you've heard me say before, we're not going to stop at just the five -- if we get an opportunity to go to the plus, we're going to take advantage of that as these initiatives continue to play out this year. Lance Fritz : And Allison, this is Lance. So Jim can add more technicolor. But as we've stopped humping in a place like Pine Bluff or Hinkle, we did not tear out the hump. And they do continue to switch cars. They flat switch cars right now that are meant to be there. We speak in terms of cars that are naturally meant to be in those yards. That's either because that's where they fit in the network for where they're trying to go or where they came from or they're literally local cars. So Jim you got anything else in that? Jim Vena : Yes, listen, Allison. For me, I don't look at it as I need to shut a hump yard down. What I look at is, is how do I speed up the railcars? And as a team, how do we get more utilization of the railcars, better utilization of the locomotives, better utilization of the people? So you can see what we did in the first quarter even with the impact. Our train size jumped up 7%. That's key. That tells us that we're moving more railcars on the same number of trains, and you can do the math, what that does on people starts. You see an increase in locomotive productivity up 6% first quarter. And we will continue to look for opportunities. And I know there's opportunity there. So -- and we do that. We have less locomotives and it impacts the whole system on how we do it from mechanical engineering, we removed a number of trains. So we have started. So the terminals is a subset of what we're trying to do. And maybe I'm getting too long on this, but it's real important. I don't wake up in the morning, and say, I'm going to shut down another hump yard. If they can save on the touch points, if it speeds up the railcars and if it makes sense that it's a cheaper model to shut down the hump yards. That's why Hinkle went as a hump yard. That's why Pine Bluff has gone as a hump yard. And that's why Brazos we looked at and said, we don't need it right now with the mix of traffic that we have and the efficiency we can do with the terminals we have. That's the way I look at it. So hopefully, Allison I explained it to say, I'm not looking for the next one. Now let me finish this. Is there a next one? Yes, there is. But we'll announce it when we pull the trigger. Allison Landry : Okay. That was really helpful. Thanks for that color. And then yesterday KCS was talking about the severe congestion issues that have plagued the Houston area. And I know historically, it's been probably an even bigger pain point for you guys, but I wanted to get your perspective on how PSR can help to improve fluidity there? And whether you think there could be an opportunity to scale back the elevated CapEx you've had to put in the region in the last several years? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Yes, I'll start Allison. So Houston is a very complex terminal complex. It's got a number of different class 1s operating in a ton of industry with a lot of local service attached. So to your point, I mean, historically, it's been a -- it's one of the more difficult areas of the railroad to operate reliably and efficiently. Having said that, implementing Unified Plan 2020 down there has shown it makes a difference. We're providing more frequent local service. We're touching cars less frequently. And as a result, we're becoming more reliable in our service product. We're a big footprint in the area, but we're not the only one and we have rely on smooth coordination with the other railroads in the area which we work on every day and are getting a little bit better at every day. Jim? Jim Vena : Allison what I can say is, is we are current and we're very fluid in Houston. There's a lot of traffic. There's multiple railroads that operate on each other's tracks and we've got to work close to make sure that we get all the traffic as I want us all to be successful. And it's nice that the other railroads are also looking at how they improve the efficiency of their operation. And I think we've got to work together to make sure that we've got a clean operation through Houston. But if you take a look at what we've been able to do, we've been able to increase the productivity and the number of cars put through in our Houston complex and we have to switch from all the customers and we'll continue to look for opportunities to make a much more fluid so we turn the cars quicker. Good number to look at is our terminal dwell which we were able to drop substantially in the first quarter from last year. You drop terminal dwell by 20% which started before I got here. So, I give a lot of credit to Tom Lischer and the whole operating group and the whole company. But at the end of it we drop that by 20% we're more fluid. So, I think we have a solution. We've all fairly current right now and we'll work with the rest of the parties as we move ahead to make it as fluid as any other place in the railroad. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you, guys. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Jim just a follow-up to the previous lines of questioning. Are there I guess any large quick payback types of projects that are happening today? Because there's not -- there's just not that many quarters left between now and the end of 2020 and the implied incrementals are quite heroic to get to the target in 2020. And it's obviously -- it gets incrementally harder every quarter we progress. So, I'm just wondering if we're going to see this breakout in operating results. I know the weather was an impact in the quarter. Or is this more like a 2020 event given the types of changes you're addressing? Or some of the changes that are being implemented maybe had quicker paybacks that we could see in the next two to -- one to two quarters? Thanks. Jim Vena : Listen if we look at it we've said that we're going to be sub-61%. So, we've got everything in place to be able to beat sub-61% and we're going to deliver it. And there's a lot of projects that we have in operations and through the whole company. It's -- this is not just an operations delivered product this is an entire company delivering leadership from the whole company. So, I think the simple answer is we're going to deliver under 61% And I can't use that word about go buy it anymore, okay? But I'm very comfortable that we've got the right product in place operationally in the rest of the company to deliver that. Rob Knight : Maybe if I can just chime in there. This is Rob. It is -- you obviously can tell from our results and our tone that we feel really, really good about the early innings of the implementation of the PSR the Unified Plan 2020 and G55 + 0 initiatives, et cetera in the face of the very big challenges that we faced in the first quarter with down volume. So, if you look at the balance of the year and our guidance is that for the full year volume will be on the positive side of ledger. So, we think we're in a great position to leverage not only the great work that Jim just walked through, but the added positive volume that we are projecting for the balance of the year. The combination of that is what gets us to that sub-61%. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. And then just one follow-up maybe on the other side of that question. 60% OR -- 61% are under OR is well below what obviously CSX is reporting. At what point does Union Pacific's profitability targets I guess better reflect the structural advantages of the business especially from the length of haul perspective? Lance Fritz : Yes. Amit so first things first we're focused on executing our current goals which is sub-61% this year, sub-60% next year. Of course we're not going to stop and pause there. And we've for quite some time said we think we're capable of a 55% and we think sometime after 2020 we are more confident than ever that we're capable of a 55%. So, without using anyone else's yardstick just looking at what we're capable of doing, we are very, very confident we're going to hit our near-term goals and then later we'll talk about other goals. Amit Mehrotra : Any sense on when that 55% the timeframe -- I know you've been resisting on talking about it, but is it early next decade, mid-next decade, any better kind of refinement around what the time frame of that is? Lance Fritz : Yes, Amit, let's get below 60% first and we'll talk about it. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, I had to ask. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kenny I guess I wanted to come back to this issue of inventory pull-forward because you guys mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Have you pulled your customer base and just thought about the idea that maybe we pull-forward a lot in 2018 early 2019 and we could see a prolonged dwell in intermodal demand throughout the summer? Kenny Rocker : Yes, we've been talking to our customers and we do know that there's still some inventory out in the warehouses out on the West Coast. And I think the best thing is to let us get through April and into May and we'll get a little bit more clarity on that, but we are seeing some of that being worked off right now. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that. And then Jim I want to come back to your prepared remarks as well because I think you mentioned that you stopped capital work at the Brazos Yard, which if I'm not mistaken I think was a key tenant of the prior operating plant. So, can you talk about where you see maybe more opportunities on the capital side of the budget? And I think Lance in the past you talked about capacity and the network being around 190,000 or 195,000 units per week. Is that still the same or should we be thinking we're unlocking a lot of potential capacity in the network here? Lance Fritz : I'll start on capacity and I think you've got it right at the tail end in part and that is we are unlocking terminal capacity predominantly through Unified Plan 2020 and the implementation of PSR. Having said that we've always talked about capital is put where we find constraints that keep us from executing the plan. And so there are some targeted capital areas remaining and there probably always will be where mixed shift or volume shift or how we're running a railroad tells us we can get real benefit with a rightful shot of capital. I'll also mention at Brazos, so for a little while now, we've been talking about the implementation of UP 2020 could very well either change the way we use Brazos or change its timing. And by unlocking capacity and touching cars fewer times around Brazos, we found that we have an opportunity to pause that capital that we don't need to increment yet in the network. So, Jim do you want to talk about where capital might be spent? Jim Vena : Sure. One example is we have a network and we're blessed that we have a lot of capacity in areas where we can run trains to where other people have been running them and where we've been running them. So, that being able to tie in we're going to spend some money that some of the money that we reallocated from Brazos to put long sidings in between L.A. and El Paso, so we can continue to run trains at the length that we the capability that we have. We started with a few trains that helped us on our length but we think that we hardened that capability will be later on this year. Third quarter we'll be able to really bump-up and safe train starts and run trains at the size that we have the capability of operating. So, we're smart that not only -- I don't want to be short-term focused. I think we're building this railroad for the long-term and invest in the right places that helps us to be able to keep this railroad running efficiently two, three, four, five years down the road. Rob anything on the capital? Rob Knight : I think you covered it. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask one about the train schedule. I think that UP in September announced they were moving to PSR approach and develop the three corridors and plans to rolling those out. Jim you didn't start till I think mid-January or so. So, with the framework that a big part of PSR or a big component is reviewing and changing the schedules, it seems like a lot of that was done before you got there. So, is it possible that you have kind of another round of reviewing the schedules resetting? Or how should we look at it given a lot of the plan seem to be in place before you even got there? Jim Vena : I think the team -- Tom, great question. The team did a great job of speeding up the railcars getting rid of some touches. I think the next step is we get to refine that. We -- when I look at the network we have trains that are operating that we have opportunities to be able to speed them up make -- to be able to start less trains so that's the next piece that we're doing. So, great foundation built on by the entire team before I got here on January 14 and we're building on that, but lots of opportunity from what I see in how we operate our trains and yards. Lance Fritz : And Tom, let's also be clear that Unified Plan 2020 when implemented was perceived and that's one of the reasons we brought Jim on. It's perceived to be an evergreen process. So, we -- getting Jim's perspective, his fresh eyes on that first round of implementation, we're going to find more and we'll continue to find more year after year after year. So, it's meant to be an evergreen process that continually gets fine tuned. Kenny Rocker : And Tom, the other thing I'll add is that Jim and I our commercial teams are working together, so our envision of a more reliable product. And again, we think that will help us grow in the marketplace. Tom Wadewitz : But just to be clear on that. So, do you think there is another significant review of this schedule, or is it more kind of tweaking things? Lance Fritz : No, it's still significant. Tom Wadewitz : It's still significant? Okay. Appreciate that. And a quick one for you Kenny, just on the coal and grain side, I mean, I guess, when you have the corridors is there a shot you prioritize trains typically. I would think of coal and grain being lower priority than merchandise and intermodal. So, I mean, is there a pent-up demand for coal and grain where you have probably some -- the network starts running you can handle some more volume in those areas? Is that a reasonable thing to consider in the near-term that you might have some pent-up coal and grains to handle? Kenny Rocker : Well, first of all, I debate you on the fact. We really appreciate the coal and the Ag business. So, I need to clarify that. It's a small upside to that and we're working with the receivers and the shippers on both sides of both the coal and the Ag side. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So, to start, I just wanted to clarify on the productivity target. Is the $500 million plus guidance a growth productivity number? And if so, could you share your outlook for net productivity this year? It sounds like the $60 million of operational challenges we saw in the first quarter isn't going to zero in the second quarter, but it should be down significantly. So, I just wanted to get some more color around that. Rob Knight : Yeah, Justin, this is Rob. That's a great question. Our $500 million plus productivity guidance goal is a net. So, we achieved $60 million in the first quarter to your point. And yes, there will be some lingering carryover weather related cost in the second quarter, but significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter. But that does imply for us to get $500 million plus for the full year when you consider we have only $60 million of it which was great work considering the conditions that shows our confidence and our ability to continue to make progress as the year progresses. Justin Long : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, going back to the terminal rationalization and network changes, are you expecting this to generate any gains on sale as you look out the next couple of years? And if so, were any gains getting baked into that 2019 or 2020 OR guidance? Lance Fritz : Hey, Justin, no gains other than normal annual gains which we talk about all the time. We always have our real estate team looking for opportunity to monetize assets, we no longer need. That's a normal flow of business. There's nothing unusual that has been baked into our guidance for 2019 and 2020. And we'll just keep evaluating our property as it makes sense. Rob Knight : If I can just make one other comment, just a clarification. At Union Pacific, we do not count real estate sales in our operating ratio calculation. Justin Long : Okay. That\u2019s good to clarify. Appreciate the time. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks. Good morning. Kenny, maybe a question on the volume outlook. Just is my understanding what we've seen so far in the first quarter, obviously, there's some weather disruptions and some softer numbers and then you maintained the outlook for the full year. Obviously, there's been some profound of activity, inventories maybe a bit on the high side. It sounds like we're working through that now. Is there something else that you're seeing that makes you a little bit more confident that we can hit that? There's obviously an implied sort of acceleration as you move into 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. It seems like maybe there's still some lingering impacts on the network. I just wanted to get a sense of sort of how you're looking at it? And what you're hearing from the customers about sort of the demand environment to get you comfortable and certainly a little bit of that acceleration as we go through the rest of the year? Kenny Rocker : So, yeah, just I want to reiterate the low single digit volume forecast for the year. And yeah, we are talking to our customers. The economy looks stable right now, and there is sort of a mixed bag with it. I'll tell you that there are commodities like our metals business. I talked a little bit about our petroleum. We talked for a while about plastics. Industrial production is still on the positive side even though it was revised downward a little bit and the uncertainty is around international trade. On one end you've got the Ag business that we export out that we've talked about. And then the other piece that we're looking at is, will there be an impact on the trade coming from Asia? And how will that demand look. But overall, we feel like it's a pretty stable economy for us to grow in. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then you touched on this earlier in the call. Just on the headcount and how we think about maybe that flowing out over the course of this year. Obviously, there's a big sequential step down in the first quarter and presumably volumes come back in a better way as the rest of the year progresses. Any sort of incremental color you can help us with in terms of how we should be thinking about that as 2019 progresses. Can you make further progress sequentially from where we are as we see some natural sort of variation of volume going forward? Rob Knight : Hey, Chris, this is Rob. I mean, you know, we're not going to give a specific headcount number. But when you look at our confidence coming out of the first quarter where our headcount was down a total of four with some challenges. Obviously, that impacted that number and our commitment of a $500 million plus productivity number, which is going to be a -- a big chunk of that is going to come from the labor line. It does imply that we are confident in our ability to continue to drive headcount down and hopefully with positive volume that is our plan. So, the combination of that is powerful and that's what gets to the sub-61%. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Rob Knight : Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on the planned CapEx shift. You guys have always been adamant that you guys still need to pursue growth while implementing PSR. I think, there's been some skepticism about whether that's possible or not. But kind of just given some of the CapEx shifts in Brazos and such, is there like a slight shift in that plan? Lance Fritz : No. So, Ravi, two things. One is, we continue to view capital the same way we always have viewed capital, which is it's got to generate an attractive return. We'll put it where we need it. We plan capital from the bottom up, but we still think we're going to be at or below -- I think below is our guidance, 15% of revenue. Where that capital is going is shifting around as Unified Plan shifts traffic and puts emphasis on some areas of the network where maybe it hadn't been before. The second part of your question, which was can you grow when you're implementing a PSR railroad? And we think absolutely you can. We think the end game is a consistent reliable service. Our customers want that. As we demonstrate we delivered that. We believe there's upside to the volume that is available to us. So, we think growth is achievable. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And I also, I believe you guys filed with the STB for trackage rights agreement with Norfolk Southern. Can you give us a little more color there? Is that just temporary thing to get past the weather issues, or is it more of a longer term solution? Lance Fritz : Ravi, I'm not sure exactly what you're referencing there. I will say that we have coordinated with other railroads through these weather events and are still doing some of that with peer railroads. That's just part of the normal course of business when we face significant traffic disruption. Ravi Shanker : Okay. I can follow-up offline. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hi. Good morning, guys. So, Jim and Rob maybe a question for you guys on the redeployment of some of the existing CapEx, since sort of capacity producing initiative as you're pushing some of the CapEx from Brazos and extending sidings in the Sunset. Jim, are there areas that you see additional work needing to be done to sort of unleash further productivity? Can you give us a sense for how much runway there might be here not to just change the scheduling and the operations, but also to change the physical plant a little bit? I guess, the real question here is, how constrained are you by the setup of the existing network right now and when do those constraints lift? A \u2013 Jim Vena : David, good question. So I think we've got a great network. I think we have -- we can operate in a real very fluid manner. As we implement PSR, we actually get more capacity. So we're going to spend capital only in places where it allows us to be more efficient than we are today and deliver a better product to our customers. So with this whole -- at the end of the day when we're done with this PSR, done meaning that we've got most of it implemented, because it's a continuous view. We want to be able to give our customers the best service so that they can compete in the marketplace against everybody else and we win and they win. And that's what we want to build. So this is not -- I don't feel constrained anywhere, but down the Sunset there was an opportunity for us to be able to improve our service to our customers, to be able to be more efficient ourselves. We can get into Chicago quicker if we can. All the better. We're real strong in Texas. We want to continue that and we want to build on that. So our customer wins, they win more business we win. So that's what's it all about. David Vernon : And then maybe as you come out of that process, as you think about -- in your prior experience as far as kind of the way capital is deployed the management at MOW function, when you come out of this thing, where do you think the long run CapEx isn't coming? I know you guys have been saying sort of sub-15%, but with a layer mix of traffic kind of running over the network could it be -- can you help us understand kind of how below 15% that long-term CapEx number could be? Lance Fritz : Rob, would you handle that for us please? Rob Knight : Yes. David I'll just reiterate what you heard us say and by the way we're very proud of the effort that has been under way for several years to get us to the -- where we are today in terms of a sub-15% of our revenue in terms of a confidence level of our ability to spend capital where the returns are there and still be at that 15% or lower number. That's a pretty good progress. So I would just say that, we totally understand the value and the impact of capital dollars both on the positive side in terms of investing where growth and opportunity and returns are there, but also on the cash side of being as disciplined as we can and not spending capital where we don't need to spend and freeing up capital dollars where we can. We're all about that. But at this point in time, our guidance remains 15% or less of revenue under capital spending and a lot more to play out as you've heard from Jim all morning today, as he looks at different opportunities going forward. David Vernon : So there's no sort of commentary on whether the PSR or post-PSR world would be even better than sub-15% number or...? Rob Knight : At this point no. David Vernon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Kenny, I'd like to come back on international intermodal. You obviously had a very nice increase year-over-year and you called out some business wins. Can you give us a sense of the timing of those wins? And how much left of the comp spaces that that's going to drive? And if there's any -- when you look at your pipeline of what might be coming up, do you feel good about any upcoming potential new business wins that will allow you to keep growth going forward? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So we lap those here within the next couple of quarters -- next couple of months here. And yes, I do feel very bullish about the pipeline that's out there our business development pipeline. And as I've stated, the beauty of what we're seeing with this more reliable service products, we saw that before the floods is that it opens up rail-centric market for us. And as we get more confident, we're expecting that to open up truck-centric type opportunity. But we've got a good cadence of opportunities that we can compete on and we just want to make sure that we can win those at the appropriate levels for us. Walter Spracklin : When you look at the pricing environment, you're kicking up nicely every quarter it seems. And I just wanted to understand if that's due to some of the prior weakness or lower trucking or higher trucking prices and therefore may slow? Or is it more of a better rail pricing environment than what you've seen previously? I just want to get a handle on how much more pricing trends we can anticipate? Or do we start to see it dip down as pricing in the trucking market starts to come back down a bit? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So we -- you're right we saw a stronger pricing environment during the second half of last year. I'll tell you this year, we are seeing some softness in the spot market. So we still think that the overall contractual truck market is a stable market. I'll call that stable. So the expectation really is that the commercial team they're just going to price to the market that's out there and we're expecting that a more reliable service product will also help us in that. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And just a housekeeping if I may. The tax rate that you called out there just north of 23%. You indicated that Q2 might be a little lumpy. Do you have a guidance for the Q2 tax rate relative to the full year tax rate that you guided? Rob Knight : No. Other than Walter I did call out the $21 million Arkansas item that will show up in the second quarter. So that will show up in the second quarter and the full year as lower rate than what we previously were projecting based on that and the impact of equity exercise of options on our tax rate. Walter Spracklin : And should we use $24 million longer term, which is was what you kind of guided to before these kind of lumpy items. Is that in a good number for... Rob Knight : Beyond 2019, that's probably a reasonable assumption. Walter Spracklin : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning. Just one question here. So the IMCs has had a strong call it 12 months on the pricing front. Your competitor is obviously in discussion with their IMCs. You got a 55 OR goal and I would be presumptuous, but I would say intermodal is going to play a significant role in achieving that. So my question is, why don't you guys push harder on domestic intermodal price to really catch up with what the IMC saw? Or is it that you're under some multi-year contracts with the IMCs and we could see that maybe when those contracts reset or am I missing something altogether? Kenny Rocker : Yes. What I'd say is that you've see our price come up sequentially. I get -- I have a guess that I can see how we're pricing this business and we are pleased that we're pricing to the market. I won't go into any details on how we're differentiating the pricing instead of our domestic versus our international intermodal business. But I can tell you that as the market shows out, we price to that market. And I'll continue to say that as we get our service product more reliable and also in our intermodal network that we'll expect that we'll be able to price accordingly. Tyler Brown : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. Fadi Chamoun : Good morning. And thank you for squeezing me in here. Just one lingering question for Jim. Jim, when I look at the kind of classification assets relative to the size of the manifest network of Union Pacific and compare it to some of the other railroad the Canadian railroad, -- kind of -- the other railroad that implemented PSR. You still have significantly larger classification and network relative to the other railroad with PSR. So is there a specific reason why maybe because of mix or other issues, you would have that larger classification network? Or is it fair for us to kind of interpret that as a potentially long-term strong opportunity for rationalization? A \u2013 Jim Vena : Fadi, it's a good question. Every railroad is different and intermittently knowledgeable of one another okay to the point where I understand how the setup is. So we have to be careful in that -- a hump yard there is nothing wrong with a hump yard. It's the most efficient way to handle 1,800, 2,000 cars a day. There is nothing better. It's low cost. It works well. So if the business is such that you need it, it would be remiss to start pulling around by moving cars to other places. My focus is you take the touch points out. You go longer haul trains. You have trains that can handle more cars. And if we need a hump yard, then we put it in place. I think there's opportunity, but never judge one railroad over the other, because of the traffic mix and the kind of flow of traffic that we have. So I know how many CN has and I know how many of the other railroads have. And I can tell you that we will get to the point where we have just enough hump yards to handle the cars most efficiently. And it's -- in some places, it's more important for us to shut down multiple yards that we have in a city where we go down from three to two or to one. Just like we're looking at the intermodal that we mentioned in Chicago. We've got a number of work sites in there and we think, we can give our customers a better product by dropping and consolidating and be able to operate in a smoother manner in Chicago and give a better product to our customers and be more efficient. So that's what's it's all about Fadi. Hopefully I explained it. Q \u2013 Fadi Chamoun : That's great. And maybe one close follow-up, so you've talked in the past about trying to remove the level of maybe a customization that has been built over time and inherited this manifest network. Is this process still ongoing? Or have you changed the service and the design of the service to the point where that's becoming more active I guess? A \u2013 Lance Fritz : Fadi, this is Lance. Yes, that process is still under way. So if you go back, the way we would describe the network prior to Unified Plan 2020 was, really an accumulation of unique train service designs. Automotive network and a coal network and a grain network and an ethanol network and rock network and et cetera et cetera. As the first phase of Unified Plan 2020 happened, we consolidated a number of those unique services into manifest service, so that a train was handling more than one type of commodity. There's still work to be done there. There's still plenty of opportunity to be done there. And at the same time Fadi, there are still going to be parts of our network that are specialized unique trains. For instance, the coal network makes all the sense in the world. In most cases to remain in a unit shuttle train network, as do green shuttles, as do some of our rock network. But we have just taken that too far I think in our previous design and we've unwound a good part of it and there's still more to be done. Q \u2013 Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. It has been a long call. So I thought I just ask one on the 7% increase in train lengths. Just wondering, if you can give a bit of color on where that was achieved in the network either by line of business or by geography and talk about how much higher you're able to take that based on the current siding infrastructure? A \u2013 Jim Vena : Well we do it across the company. Actually, we did in our east-west northern flow from the West Coast all the way to Chicago. We did it on the Sunset. We were able to do it on the mid-America north-south from Texas up to Chicago and up into Minnesota. And we also were able to do some of it and we're just starting there on our bulk capability. We think there's capability to be able to operate those trains in a much more efficient manner. So we'll continue to do it, Cherilyn. So it was spread out through the whole company. A \u2013 Lance Fritz : Yes. And Cherilyn, in terms of what's feasible? You're exactly right. Different routes on the network have different train length capability, but there's -- that's not a hard and fast rule, right? We've talked historically about -- it's about where can you meet and pass traffic? And that doesn't mean every train on that corridor has to be built to the length of the sightings. You can always dictate that some of the traffic exceeds siding length and that means the pass for -- the opposing train has to take the siding. So there's a lot of moving parts there. We've got plenty of upside from where we are right now. Q \u2013 Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Would that 7400-foot train lengths achieved their mark would that be a record for the company? A \u2013 Lance Fritz : I don't know. We'd have to look at that. A \u2013 Jim Vena : I wish it was because I have records. But Cherilyn, we'd be guessing. So -- but if there is a record better than that Cherilyn, I want to go by it. Q \u2013 Cherilyn Radbourne : All right. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Adam Kramer : Hey guys, this is Adam on for Jason. I guess I'll try and keep it quick here with just a single question for you guys. And this may be more for Jim. But I just want to ask about the challenges of implementing PSR at UP versus CN and taking a much longer outlook, much longer in terms of time. Is there anything that would inhibit similar outcomes over time at UP versus CN? A \u2013 Lance Fritz : Hey Jim, would you also -- when we answer that question reflect on timing of implementing. Q \u2013 Jim Vena : I think sometimes people forget that it took a while at CN to really get it moving and get it to the place where it became the most efficient railroad in North America. It wasn't a quick fix and go. And I think it was -- it took some time and lessons learned. There's some things you can do quicker, but you also don't want to impact your service to customers and lose a lot of business because of it. So I'm doing it and we're doing it as quick as we can. We think we have a great plan and we'll move ahead. What I found here at Union Pacific was -- it's a brand-new company. I didn't know a lot of people when I showed up. But I tell you the quality of the group right through the whole company and I've visited a lot of places. I flew into every one of the locations, major locations that we have in this company and I found people at the front line that want to be. There their goal is the same as my goal. They want to have the best operating efficiency in the industry. So when you start with that as a base, it's a wonderful place to be and it goes from the top to the bottom of the company and back up. So it's truly an exciting place to be. Q \u2013 Jim Vena : Thanks Jim, appreciate the time. A \u2013 Lance Fritz : You are welcome. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Ben Hartford : Hello, thanks for taking the time. I just want to circle back on -- in international intermodal you included a question mark here in the slide and obviously you talked about the inventory overhang to start the year. As you think about international for the balance of the year and adding some of the uncertainty, due to the fact that inventories are a bit elevated? Or is it a bit more structural? And if we look at the west -- the port data in March East Coast were stronger than West. Is there something structural going on as it relates to diversion away from the west? Or is the uncertainty just due to the fact that inventory levels here at the beginning of the year are elevated? A \u2013 Kenny Rocker : I think it's easy to forget that the -- hopefully have started back in 2018 and so -- and they carried all the way into 2019. So we're talking about a pretty long period of time here. So yes it is about the inventory levels. We do need to see how they work off. As I mentioned we'd have a lot more clarity as we get through April and May. Now on the second half of the year, we'll have tougher comps but we're expecting that a stable economy will still provide a positive number there. Q \u2013 Ben Hartford : Okay. And maybe this is as a follow-up on the domestic intermodal side for you and Jim as well. As you think about domestic intermodal, I think you talked about pricing to the market, but also helping that -- or hoping that a more reliable service product would help that sales the value proposition. As you think about the next three to five years as PSR takes hold, the market is going to do what it's going to do. Spot pricing was weak. But as you think about the conversion opportunity over the road, over the next several years that was removed as -- on this outlook supply as well. How do you see the domestic intermodal conversion opportunity stripping out sterilizing some of the cyclical noise right now? As you get service where it needs to be is this still a product that can grow at a multiple of US underlying let's say U.S., IP or GDP growth? A \u2013 Kenny Rocker : Yes. So I've stated in my comments and I reiterated. I'm bullish. We're bullish on the fact that there is upside on the domestic intermodal business and yes a more reliable service product will help us out there. And I got to emphasize this, as we're talking about it. Also in our manifest business, there's still a room for us to grow in our rail-centric business. And for us to capture manifest business that's moving truck. So it's not just domestic intermodal piece we're bullish across-the-board here. Q \u2013 Ben Hartford : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much Rob and thank you all for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in July. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting record 2019 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.22 a share. This represents an increase of 4% in net income and 12% in earnings per share compared to 2018. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at an all-time best mark of 59.6%, a 3.4 percentage point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2018. This is the first time Union Pacific has ever recorded a sub-60% operating ratio for a full quarter. And while that's a remarkable achievement, it's magnified when you consider the challenges we faced from significant flooding that adversely impacted volumes and added incremental operating costs during the quarter. That's a testament to the tireless dedication of the men and women of Union Pacific. Working with our customers and the communities that we serve, the team safely restored our rail operations while continuing to drive productivity through our G55 + 0 and Unified Plan 2020 efforts. As a result, our operations have returned to normal, enabling us to focus on providing a safe, reliable, and efficient service product for our customers. The Unified Plan 2020 transformation at Union Pacific is full steam ahead, and I continue to be encouraged by the great opportunities we see for our customers and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide some details on our results. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, our volume was down 4% as gains in our Industrial business group were more than offset by declines in Premium and Energy. However, we generate a positive net core pricing of 2.75% in the quarter, as we continue to price our service product to the value it represents in the marketplace while ensuring it generates an appropriate return. Freight revenue was down 2%, driven by the decrease in volume, partially offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Starting off with ag products : Revenue for the quarter was up 4% on flat volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 7% driven by continued reduction in export grain shipments. This was partially offset by strength in export wheat and domestic corn. Volume for grain products was down 1% as sustained demand for biofuels and related products was more than offset by challenging environment for exports. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 12% due to strength in export potash, diesel exhaust fluid and sulfur. Moving on to Energy : Revenue was down 13% as volume declined 9%, coupled with a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Sand carloads were down 50% largely due to the impact of local sand within the Permian Basin. Coal and coke volume was down 7% driven by ongoing headwinds of contract changes and retirement. Flooding in May and June also negatively impacted shipment. In addition, coal exports were lower due to softer market conditions. However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipment, which was a primary driver for the 30% increase in petroleum, LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter. Industrial revenue was up 4% on a 2% increase in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 4% primarily driven by strong market demand in the south for rock shipment. Plastics volumes increased 6% due to higher production. Forest products volume decreased 10% driven by reduced paper shipment as a result of high containerboard inventory and decreased lumber shipment associated with lower housing starts. Turning to Premium : Revenue for the quarter was down 2% with a 5% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car improved by 4%. Domestic intermodal volume declined 11% during the quarter as a softer market coupled with weather-related service issue led to lower volume. Industrial intermodal volume was up 1% in the quarter as volume returned back to seasonal levels following a tariff pull ahead in the previous two quarters. And finally, finished vehicle shipments were up 1% as second quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 1% from 2018. Light truck and SUV sales were stronger and able to offset declining car demand. Looking ahead for the remainder of 2019, for ag products, we anticipate continued strength in biofuel shipment due to the increased market demand for renewable fuels to help offset the headwinds in the ethanol marketplace associated with exports. We also expect stronger beer shipments, along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business. Furthermore, we expect uncertainty to persist in the grain market due to reduced U.S. crop production and foreign tariffs. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. While year-over-year comps for sand ease in the second half of the year, local sand supply will continue to impact volume. We also expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019, and weather condition will always be a key factor for coal demand. For Industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments driven largely by plant expansions coming online later this year, coupled with continued strength in the construction market in Texas. However, we are watching the forest products market as housing starts are forecasted to be down year-over-year in the second half. And lastly, for Premium, the U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2019 is 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. However, consumer preference for SUVs over sedans will continue to help offset the declining car demand. Domestic intermodal volume is expected to be impacted by truck competition in the second half of 2019, which may limit opportunities for over-the-road truck conversions, but longer term fundamentals still provide a bullish outlook for over-the-road conversions. In addition, uncertainty in trade and the economy could create a tough fourth quarter comp due to the pull ahead we saw in late 2018 for international intermodal shipment. And so before I turn it over to Jim for his operational update, I want to share that I continue to be encouraged how we work collaboratively with the operating team. Jim and I have been making difficult decisions to improve the overall supply chain and aligning our sales with our customers to find the best way to serve and grow with them. In the end, this builds us a solid platform for more reliable service product for our customers. And now I'll turn it over to Jim. Jim Vena : Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Kenny. As you've already heard this morning, our network was once again challenged by significant prolonged flooding in our Mid-America Corridor. We responded by rerouting traffic and deploying additional people and equipment to quickly restore operations. And I am pleased to report that with the weather behind us, including Hurricane Barry, our network has returned to normal operations. I would be remiss not to say how proud I am of our employees who responded to the challenge, working efficiently and without injury to restore operations in the face of some pretty adverse conditions, while delivering an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59.6%. This truly was a remarkable achievement. It all starts for us with safety. As safety remains job one at Union Pacific and our commitment is relentless. We have opportunities to improve our rail equipment incidents, and we're working as a team to learn and improve each and every day. Turning to slide 11. I'd now like to update you on our six key performance indicators. Despite the weather, most of our metrics improved year-over-year. This is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020. Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 14% improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 4% improvement in freight car velocity compared to the second quarter of 2018. Train speed for the second quarter decreased 6% to 23.1 miles per hour as flooding impacted fluidity. Train speeds also were affected by the 30-plus percent increase in daily work events being performed as the part of Unified Plan 2020. While these work events are helping us increase train size and drive asset utilization, the team is still working to execute these work events even more efficiently and drive faster train speeds. Turning to slide 12 : Continuing our trend from the first quarter, locomotive productivity improved 19% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of June 30, we had somewhere around 2,150 locomotives stored. Driven by an 8% decrease in our workforce levels, productivity increased 4% year-over-year. In addition to improving productivity, delivering a great service product is of equal importance to the team. Car trip plan compliance was basically flat year-over-year as the benefit from an increased freight car velocity and lower dwell were offset by the impact of weather on our network. We expect our service product to improve going forward. In fact, we're already seeing improvements in July. Slide 13 : We continue to push forward with Unified Plan 2020, and the slide highlights some of the recent network changes. From a terminal rationalization standpoint, we stopped humping cars at our Proviso yard in Chicago and curtailed yard operations in Salem, Illinois, at our 36th St. Yard in Denver, East Yard in San Antonio. Proviso, in particular, was a very old and inefficient hump yard, still using retarder operators to manually flow cars into the ball tracks. By moving this work to outlying yards, including one of our most efficient in North Platte, we are not only saving labor dollars but avoiding capital as well. In addition, we have made a number of changes in the Kansas City complex to improve service and increase efficiency. We've largely consolidated traffic out of Armourdale facility while cars previously handled in Des Moines, Iowa are now switched in Kansas City. And our plan to simplify intermodal operations in Chicago is well underway. We idled our Global three facility, and the Canal Street Container Depot will follow shortly. Going forward, we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches on our network, which will undoubtedly lead to additional terminal rationalization opportunities. And we are making excellent progress with our train length initiatives as illustrated by the graph on the right. By putting more products on fewer trains, we increased train length 10% since January of this year, and I expect to see continued improvement as the year progresses. To wrap up, while a number of bold steps have been taken and the results are evident, there are a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. Once again, our network showed tremendous resiliency in the face of significant weather during the quarter as we have returned to normal operations. As we move forward, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for both our customers and our shareholders is our number one priority. And with that, Rob, over to you. Rob Knight : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Today, we're reporting second quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and 3.4 points of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio to 59.6%. This represents an all-time best quarterly operating ratio for Union Pacific and is a testament to the great work we are doing with G55 + 0 and Unified Plan 2020. Our quarterly results were, however, affected by some one timers so before I jump into the details, let me give you some technicolor. Like the first quarter, significant weather events impacted volumes and added operating expenses. These weather challenges resulted in a 0.6 point negative impact to our operating ratio and $0.07 earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2018. And I'll detail that more in a minute. We also recognized a $32 million payroll tax refund, along with $3 million of associated interest income. This was part of the $78 million refund that we outlined in the 8-K that we filed in March. The refund had a 0.6 point favorable impact on the operating ratio and $0.04 EPS tailwind in the quarter compared to last year. The combined impact of lower fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a favorable impact for the quarter of 0.6 points on the operating ratio and $0.04 of EPS compared to 2018. The good news is that despite the weather challenges and lower volumes, we drove core operating margin improvement of almost 3 points or $0.23 of EPS compared to the second quarter last year. To give you a little more detail on the weather impact, we attribute about 2 points of the 4 points second quarter volume decline to flooding or roughly $75 million. We also incurred around $19 million of weather-related costs in the quarter, primarily in the compensation and benefits and purchased services and materials cost categories. With all of our routes returned to service, we do not expect any weather-related cost to carry over into the third quarter. And now let's recap our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% versus last year. The primary driver was the 4% decrease in volume. Operating expense totaled $3.3 billion, down 7% from 2018. Operating income totaled $2.3 billion, an 8% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $57 million, an increase of $15 million compared to last year. Interest expense of $259 million was up 28% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense increased 14% to $488 million. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.7%. For the full-year, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the mid-23% range. Net income totaled $1.6 billion, up 4% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance decreased 7%, as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. As we noted earlier, these results combined to produce second quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59.6%. Freight revenue of $5.2 billion was down 2% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $399 million, down $13 million, when compared to 2018. Business mix was essentially flat for the second quarter driven by decreased sand volumes and significantly less intermodal shipments. Core price was 2.75% in the second quarter. Slide 19 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 8% to $1.1 billion versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total force levels, which were down 8% or about 3,500 FTEs in the second quarter versus last year. Productivity initiatives along with lower volumes resulted in a 5% decrease in our TE&Y workforce, while our management engineering and mechanical workforces together declined 11%. Fuel expense totaled $560 million, down 13% compared to 2018, due to lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed. Average diesel fuel prices decreased 4% versus last year to $2.21 per gallon and our consumption rate improved 5% through the combination of lower volumes and more efficient operations. Purchased services and material expense was down 9% compared to the second quarter of 2018 at $573 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the quarter were reduced mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, partially offset by weather and derailment-related expenses. Turning to slide 20. Depreciation expense was $551 million, up 1% compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, we estimate that depreciation expense will be up 1% to 2%. Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $260 million in the quarter, which is down 2% when compared to 2018. Other expense came in flat versus last year at $247 million. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up around 5% compared to 2018. Productivity savings yielded from our G55 and Zero initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately $195 million in the quarter, which was partially offset by additional costs associated with weather and derailments. As a result, net productivity for the second quarter was $170 million. It has been a tough first half of the year, but as we exit the quarter, the positive momentum from our productivity initiatives gives us confidence that we will still deliver at least $500 million of net productivity in 2019. Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations through the first half totaled $3.9 billion, down slightly compared to last year. Free cash flow before dividends, totaled $2.3 billion, resulting in a free cash flow conversion rate equal to 77% of net income for the first half of 2019. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $27.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $2.5 billion since year-end 2018. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. As we have previously mentioned, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times. Dividend payments for the first half totaled more than $1.2 billion, up $123 million from 2018. This includes the effect of 10% dividend increases in both the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of this year. We repurchased a total of 21.9 million shares during the first half of 2019 including 3.7 million shares in the second quarter at a cost of $639 million. Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $5.4 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. Looking out to the remainder of 2019. Although we expect second half volumes to improve sequentially from the first half that improvement will not be enough to produce year-over-year volume growth. In fact, our best thinking at this point is that volume for the second half will be down around 2% or so versus 2018. And as Kenny mentioned earlier, our pricing strategy is unchanged as we continue to price our service product to the value that it represents in the marketplace, while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return. We remain confident that the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2019. As it relates to our workforce, strong productivity initiatives and to a lesser degree lower volumes have resulted in a 6% year-to-date reduction. Looking out to the balance of 2019, we expect the combination of operating efficiency and lower business levels should result in full year force levels to be down around 10% versus 2018. Importantly, we are still confident in our ability to achieve a sub-61% operating ratio in 2019 on a full year basis, which implies that our second half operating ratio will be better than the first half. Furthermore, we still expect to be below 60% by 2020. We have to play the hand that we are dealt when it comes to volumes, but rest assured our commitment to achieving our financial targets is unwavering and has never been stronger. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered record second quarter financial results driven by exceptional operating performance. For the remainder of 2019, we look forward to building on the momentum from Unified Plan 2020 and providing a consistent reliable service product for our customers. As always, we're committed to operating a safe railroad for both our employees and the communities we serve and we remain focused on driving increased shareholder returns by appropriately investing capital on the railroad and returning excess cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning, and great job on the execution on your UP 2020. Just maybe Jim or Kenny, your thoughts on the lane closures as you shift yards and the impact on volumes as you move into the second half. Is this more an economic call Rob on the volumes? Or is this more lane closures and shifting target on volumes? Kenny Rocker : Hey, good morning Ken, this is Kenny. First of all it's a very minimal impact and a lot of those volumes that were impacted again were the lower profitable business. The commercial team did a really good job of being proactive in working with customers to make sure that we have solutions in place. So, we feel -- again, it's very minimal and we feel good about the decision to make those calls. Jim Vena : One thing I would add Kenny is -- what we're trying to do Ken is -- we're not trying to do it we're doing it. We think we build a better product for our customers. We build a better service in Chicago and other places where we're looking at the flow of traffic and it doesn't make sense for us to have six locations that we touch railcars and try to move them around. We consolidated into the minimal spots. We put them in the best place to win and we grow with the customers that are with us to be able to go from L.A. We want to build the best service going across our network. We're close. When we fix these touch points that we have, we end up with the best service that we can provide and we grow with our customers. Ken Hoexter : And Rob just as a follow-up given your move to keep the sub-61% OR and a better OR in the second half which seems reasonable just given the pace you're at just want to understand the kind of cadence of your employee cuts. Is this something you see accelerating just given the steps Jim is taking on reducing locomotives? Is it spread out on different parts? I guess is it T&E focused or is it kind of more widespread? Rob Knight : I would say its widespread Ken. And yes, year-to-date as I called out in my remarks, we're down about 6% and we expect the year average to end up around 10%. So, that does imply improvement. And it is widespread and it's really driven largely by the success of the Unified Plan 2020. And we hope at least that we'll have a free -- flood-free zone to be operating in starting today. Ken Hoexter : Great. Appreciate the time guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. So, maybe to focus on productivity, you reiterated the guidance for over $500 million in productivity for this year, but given you're maintaining the OR outlook despite the weakness in volumes and weather it seems like the expected productivity in 2019 is moving higher. Can you just give us a sense for the incremental productivity gains you expect to achieve this year versus your original expectation? And maybe give us some sense for how you're thinking about the second half relative to the $170 million of net productivity in the second quarter. Just curious do you expect that number to continue trending higher sequentially? Lance Fritz : Rob, do you want to take that? Rob Knight : Yes. Justin I would just say that really what it proves out in my mind and you've heard me say this many, many times is that we're not going to use the lack of volume as an excuse not to make aggressive achievements on our productivity. And I think with Jim and his team and the implementation of Unified Plan 2020, I feel stronger about that than I ever have frankly. And so yes, we are still -- we're sticking with our $500 million at least productivity net number. And that does imply that the second half is stronger than the first half because the first half was burdened with the inefficiency cost related to the flooding and other weather events. So, the net pace will pick up in the back half and that is our expectation. And it's across the board, but it really is largely driven by the success of the Unified Plan 2020. Justin Long : And just thinking about that sequential change, do you think third and fourth quarter can look better than what you posted in the second quarter from a net productivity perspective? Rob Knight : I mean in total yes -- we're going to stay away from giving quarterly guidance on that. But I would say in total if you look at second half versus first half, again, largely because of the overhang of the flood impact cost in the first half, yes, we expect the net number to be stronger in the second half. Justin Long : Okay. And then I guess finally thinking about productivity into 2020 you maintained the guidance for a sub-60% OR next year. Can you talk about what that assumes for productivity even if it's just from a high level? Does that assume that the productivity dollars next year are higher than what we're going to see in 2019? Lance Fritz : Hey Justin we haven't yet put together a game plan for 2020, but you're right, we're holding firm on our guidance for overall OR. And I'll let Rob speak to the details of that. Rob Knight : Yes. Justin I would say Lance is right. We don't have the final numbers on that. But I would tell you that the levers that we pull will be the same levers they always are and that is volume which we haven't finalized our outlook in terms of volume; quality reliable service that we're confident we are improving that product which enables us to continue to get appropriate price in the marketplace. And we're in the sort of still early innings by my definition of the Unified Plan 2020. So, clearly there is more productivity dollars that we will be going after to achieve that sub-60% next year. Justin Long : Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. So, Rob, I just want to just quickly clarify. The 10% head count that's an average or year-end? I'm not sure. Rob Knight : That's an average of 10% reduction year-over-year. Scott Group : Okay. Kenny, on the pricing side so with the moving pieces here the volume environment maybe, I don't know if anything's changed with BNSF just directionally is the pricing environment getting any tougher as you see it? And then I know mix is sort of an impossible one to forecast but such a dramatic change from minus 4% in the first to flat in the second. Any directional at all sort of color or idea on how we should think about second half? Kenny Rocker : Yes. You asked a number of questions there. I'll take a few here. First of all, we're focused on our pricing strategy. We've got a number of competitive forces out there beyond just the competitor in the West. There's barge and there's trucks. I'm really proud of our commercial team and their ability to just stay very focused on pricing to the service product that we have and the value we present. I'll tell you that I'm also looking forward to getting this weather behind us because I expect that our service product as it improves is going to give us an ability to compete in the marketplace. So, I like our chances as our service product improves to stick with our pricing strategy and price to the market. Lance Fritz : Scott I'll address your mix question. You know we don't guide the mix because it's very hard to figure out as we just demonstrated Q1 to Q2 and there's mix within mix as Rob says all the time. So, bottom-line is when you look backwards what happened between Q1 and Q2 was about a large drop in intermodal that aided mix. And as you look forward, we'll just have to see what the markets present to us. Scott Group : Okay. Thanks. And Rob if I can just ask you one more quick one. So, the other railway revenue was sort of flattish year-over-year down a little sequentially, any thoughts on how to think about that in the back half? Rob Knight : Yes. Nothing I would call out that's going to change the pace of that at this point. Scott Group : Thank you guys. Appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : Yes, thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the head count. And so some significant improvement on head count and certainly for productivity. I was wondering if maybe you could help us sort of understand if there's a piece of that that's sort of reaction to weaker-than-expected volume and sort of what piece of it that's sort of more of a sustainable run rate. And presumably at some point as we move into 2020, I'm guessing you guys are assuming sort of a better more stable potentially growth volume environment. So, I would imagine you wouldn't cut heads beyond what you think you can kind of manage that, but if you could give us some sense of what you're doing that's going to catch up because the volume environment's been soft. And really what's kind of core to the bigger-picture plan? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Chris, you've got it just right. When volumes get softer, we know how to adjust our resources to match what volume represents. But I would have to say, the lion's share of what you saw was about Unified Plan 2020 and productivity. And you can see that kind of across the board. We had to adjust the amount of resources we put at locomotives as we parked about a quarter of the locomotive fleet if not more. And you can see that directly related to the headcount, to the manpower that we have attached to maintaining locomotives. The same is true on maintaining cars. The same is true on the TE&Y workforce. We've taken a lot of work out of the network and it's being reflected now on our manpower. And we've got \u2013 there are more of those adjustments to be made as the network continues to stabilize and as we continue to find opportunity. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a broad question, Kenny about sort of the demand environment. So, clearly softness in volume \u2013 some of it might be some lean dynamics where it sounds like it's relatively minimal on your network. When you think about sort of what you're hearing from the customer environments why has it been so sluggish over the course of maybe the last four, five, six weeks? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So I'd tell you, we are seeing some softness in the truck environment. Clearly, trade is impacting some of our ag business and we'll continue to look at other pieces of the business in the second half. I'd tell you at the same time, I am feeling bullish about our franchise. We've got a lot of upside with our petrochem business, our industrial chem and plastics, our construction product. And I'm feeling really good about our crude oil business. So we'll see what happens in the second half. And like I said as our service improves, I like our chances to compete in the marketplace. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to go back to price for a second. I don't think you really showed too much leverage to the tighter truck market in 2018, when you calculate, it differently. So there's a 2.75% price still on the core side. Is that really sort of a lag basis from what we saw in the truck market and things are getting re-priced and showing up now? Hence I guess, the formulary would be, if you think the truck market is going to soften a little bit more can you maintain that level of coal price or something pretty close to it through the rest of this year and into 2020? Lance Fritz : Hey, Brian, this is Lance. I'll let Kenny or Rob speak to more of the detail. But when you mentioned, we calculate our price on a holistic basis that is the absolute dollars yielded during the period divided by all revenue. So in the second quarter 2.75% that's pretty solid performance in a relatively soft truck market and there is an impact in terms of what moves as to what gets counted as yield, right? I mean, you can take a price action last year on a book of business and if it doesn't move this year you get no credit for it. That's how we calculate our price. So there's a price/volume impact in there that is very hard to tease out. Kenny Rocker : The only thing I'll add is that, we'll see what happens in the second half. It doesn't change our pricing philosophy or our approach to be disciplined here. Maybe it means a couple few more opportunities. But regardless the opportunities that we're presented, we're going to be very disciplined about what business we accept and compete for. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thank you for that. And then Kenny one more for you to follow-up on coal. We've seen a lot of headlines there recently a couple of bankruptcies a big push for large-scale consolidations. So I just wanted to get your thoughts. It's been challenging for a while, but this seems like it's another step change. Just want to get your thoughts on how you adjust for that for the commercial side both in the short-term and long-term. Do you need to change how you price maybe more to natural gas try to push more exports? And then Jim, if I could get you to comment on the operating side, I think the network did a really good job of adjusting for the fallout in frac sand but this is clearly a bigger chunk of the business. It's probably got a longer and potential tail downward than some of the secular challenges. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So we've been living in a coal environment for some time, so this is not a surprise or anything new to us. It doesn't change our approach to ensuring that we compete and win the business at the appropriate return for us. We're going to stay committed to that. I will say that as you hear about some of these bankruptcies or closures it doesn't take away from the fact that another producer or shipper up in that area might be able to move that volume. So you got to keep that in mind as you're thinking about that. Jim Vena : So, Brian the only thing I'd add is this is a railroad and as long as I have and the gray hair I have markets go up markets go down pieces of the business go up and down. If you're a good operator, good company you know how to react to it. We've reacted by making sure that we don't get ahead. We plan properly with our assets. We make them as efficiently as possible. We're making the coal train, specifically more efficient so that we can have a better return on the product that we're moving, and that's what's it's all about. We have to react fast. And in other places where we see increasing business, we have to put assets in there to do that in a smart way. So it's as simple as that, Brian. Lance Fritz : Hey, Brian, one last \u2013 this is Lance. One last thing to note and that is thinking about this market holistically long-term, we've talked about this that coal has been challenged in kind of a secular decline. You see that in cold unit closures. You see it in investment in alternative sources of energy. And we'll \u2013 we've got a game plan for that in the long term at \u2013 and over time, we also care deeply about making sure that there are good healthy capitalized coal producers to serve the market. They exist today, and I know they're working hard to make sure that their future is solid and we just support them as they do that. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks for the thoughts. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Jim, I was just hoping you could talk about the additional and maybe structural cost opportunity. For example, where is the active locomotive fleet today? Where do you think you could go? What's the target for car velocity against the 200 miles per day you're doing \u2013 you're achieving today, opportunity for system-wide train length? Anything else that just gives us a sense of where you think the further opportunity is on the structural cost side relative to the improvements \u2013 the significant improvements you guys have made to-date? Thanks. Jim Vena : Appreciate it. Listen, you just don't list it. And I think there's opportunity in car velocity, there's opportunity in the locomotives, there are opportunity on terminals, there are opportunities on how we handle our trains, how we \u2013 how many touch points we have on cars. So I think like Rob said in the prepared notes, we're early in this. We've got lots of long runway to go, and many innings left to be able to deliver Amit. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I wasn't going to ask you what inning you're in but thanks for adding that anyways. Jim Vena : I do as soon as I've said that. Somebody was going to ask me what is. Appreciate it. Thanks. Amit Mehrotra : But you kind of teed up my follow-up question with respect to how all that translates to the OR. And given your early innings into all this, I would just expect your OR targets at this point when you've got six months of very strong operating performance in a tough environment to be frankly more ambitious, because there's another rail out there that has much lower revenue per carload but significantly better OR. It, obviously, takes time. So this is not a critique by any ways but I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on what the structural profitability potential is for the business based on both your longer tenure at the company and then also what other industry peers are being able to achieve? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Rob, would you take that for us? Rob Knight : Yeah. I'll make -- I'll comment on that. And Jim if you wish to contribute, obviously, you can. I mean, I would say you've heard me say this, I have never felt better about our ability to achieve the targets we've set because of what you're outlining and because of what Jim and the team were doing with Unified Plan 2020 and that is we're going to get through as sub as we can, 61% this year and then as sub as we can next year of 60% and ultimately to that 55%. So everything you're asking about we agree that there are opportunities in there. And that's -- when you add it all up that's what's going to drive us to that 55%. And I get the criticism I'll wear it that we haven't put a date out there yet on 55%. But our philosophy and our goal and our drive here at Union Pacific is to get to that sub as we can 60% first and then not stop there by any means but continue to drive towards that 55%. Jim Vena : The only thing I'll add is I like to just deliver the number and then we'll talk about it like we delivered a 59.6%. I like that number and there's opportunity there. And we'll continue to deliver. I'll let Rob worry about how we appraise the number, okay? Amit Mehrotra : And just to be clear it wasn't a criticism. I think we all respect and appreciate how hard it is to deliver the results you achieved. But I just wanted to I guess ask the question because I had to but I appreciate it. Thank you. Rob Knight : I got the whole question. I understood a bit. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could ask that OR question in a slightly different way. Jim, as you just said you're at a sub-60% already. I realize that's just a one quarter number but it was a difficult quarter. You have a lot of momentum going forward. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the feasibility of getting to that sub-60% by 2019. And specifically what would need to go right for that to happen? Would volumes have to come in better than the down 2%? Any help framing that scenario would be great. Jim Vena : I think the best way to frame the operating ratio number is it's a result of a lot of hard work, okay? So I'm very comfortable with what we've been able to do. I've been here six months and four days. And the whole team we've worked hard at train length, car productivity, freight, how fast we move the cars, the locomotive engineers, how well they're handling for fuel conservation. We're making sure that the mechanical people, how many people we need, how well they're inspecting the cars. It's a full story. And it's -- this whole company is engaged in making it the best most efficient railroad in North America. That's what we want. I'm not sure the time line exactly, because I'm not sure what's going to happen. We had a hurricane last week yet a small one not a category three or four or five, but we had a hurricane effect us. So I can't tell you Allison. I wish I could. But what I'm comfortable with is we have the right team. People are out there from the -- everybody in the company knows what we're trying to do, give a better product to our customers, grow our business and have the most efficient railroad in North America. That's what's it's all about, simple as that. Allison Landry : Okay. I appreciate that. Lance I think maybe a month ago or so in the media you had said that you guys were taking share from BN as a result of the success of our -- the United -- the Unified Plan. Could you put some maybe numbers around that in terms of volumes or share gain? And maybe give us a sense, of which end markets that you're seeing these share gains? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Allison thanks for the question. Yeah, if you look at the first half, I would say our growth is moderately better than our primary competitors. That can come from a lot of different angles. It could have to do with how their network is operating versus ours. I would say one such point for sure is our franchise is different. And we think better, we think it's the best franchise in the industry. What we would anticipate and expect as we look forward is Unified Plan 2020 creates a more consistent, reliable service product for our customers. We're a more efficient service provider. That should set us up to win in the marketplace and to have our customers win in their marketplace. And I anticipate regardless of the economy that we face that gives us the best opportunity in that economy to win and grow. I don't -- I'm not sure exactly what that looks like. I'm not sure what that looks like in comparison to BN or anyone else but that's what we're trying to achieve. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. Jim, I've got a couple for you. I wanted to see -- I appreciate the detail and the framework on what you're doing with yards and terminals. I wanted to see if you could take a step back and just give us a sense of what you started with and where you're at today, and then maybe give us a comment on broad-brush what you might get to. So just hump yards in January and maybe what you're at today. And then rail terminal, how many you had, how many you're at today, just to kind of frame it. And then I guess just a sense of how far do you have to go. Can you go from your 12 went to 10? Can you go to five or six? Or how we might think -- how you might frame that and how we might think about it on yard rationalization? Jim Vena : Okay. So when I look at the hump yards, I don't look at them because they're -- I've mentioned this before and people have heard me say this countless times they're very efficient when they handle a lot of cars and we need to have them there. You could figure out a way and then not put a car through a hump yard and save 24 hours on the car that's what it's all about any yard. So that's what -- that's the way we're looking at it. Right now we have one hump yard complex left in our Northern region. Our Northern region is a pretty big piece of railroad and it's at North Platte. That's it. And we have a non-mechanized switching yard that we classify it as a major yard but it doesn't have all the mechanization in California -- Northern California in Rolesville. But that's it that's what we have. So it's pretty hard to cut. I think North Platte is going to be there for a long time. We're asking it to work harder though. We're putting more railcars in there. And the cars they have they have to do them efficiently and we move them out. They are setting records today on how fast they're able to switch cars and get them through that complex. And I expect that to improve substantially. We've got some smart people out that are able to do that. So that's the way I look at it. I'm not sure what the heck we had. I'd be guessing on the number. I don't keep it that way. We have complexes that we need. Houston is a growth area. We expect that hump to be efficient and stay there. So it's all about being able to move the cars quicker. On the intermodal if I could be real quick, Kenny and I are aligned. In fact, we have a plan of where we're moving and we'll do that. We'll announce it as we come ahead when we need to. It's all about again giving a better product to the customer, able to handle their containers in and out in trailers faster, so that they have a better market, and we can grow. And we can compete against trucks take some of that traffic off of the highway and compete against the other railroad that we compete against head-to-head and see if we can win. And I think we will. So that's where we are. That's the best I can describe now. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So it sounds like you've done a lot already with hump rationalization or at least in the North, so we shouldn't necessarily expect a lot more of that going forward. But the intermodal terminals you still have room to go. Maybe on a different element of the operation the train length expansion of -- I think you show about 10% June versus January. It's a pretty impressive number 7,700 feet on average. How much runway is there on that? Are you constrained at this point from a sighting perspective? Or could that number continue to rise a bit further? Jim Vena : Look, all I can tell you is we're not constrained. We'll invest in places where we're constrained. We did that on the route coming out of L.A. going towards El Paso closing some gap. So we announced that three months ago. We're just about completed with that. It will help us. There's a little bit of investment, I guess, little against the $3.2 billion that we have, but we'll continue to invest to do that. Yes, train size will grow, no if ands or buts. It will grow across the whole network. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Jim Vena : Yeah. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah, thanks very much. I guess the first one here is for Rob. I mean, I know you mentioned this coming back to the OR here, I know you mentioned that you haven't put in your plans for 2020, but you effectively got a guidance for 100 basis point improvement given the guidance you have for 2019 and 2020. I guess we're all looking at you possibly getting to your 2020 target by 2019. And obviously, keeping 60% in place for 2020 because that's your guidance, wouldn't be the right thing. So, I guess, what I'm asking is if we're starting with the 100 basis point improvement as our base assumption in 2020 versus 2019 as you get your numbers together, what factors will you be using to determine whether that's to -- is that too low or too high? And perhaps I know Jim try to chime in, but the track -- the success you've been having so far today, correct me if I'm wrong, but it could amplify that 100 basis point improvement in 2020? Rob Knight : Yeah, Walter. First of all, I would say, we are not guiding to just one point of improvement. Again, kind of back to my commentary of we're going to get a sub-61% this year as we can and then as sub as we can on the 60%. So, yes, I get that the 61% to 60% is one point, but we're going to try and do as best we can to achieve as much success beyond that one point as we can. That's the sub comment. But the factors, it all kind of starts with our read of -- as we look to 2020 when we get to that point our read of what the economy is, and what do we think volume is going to be. And as we continue to drive it, as you've heard me say, many times as we continue to drive and improve our service reliability that gives us confidence to continue to be aggressive and achieve core pricing gains, which is going to be a lever. And then the balance of the ability to squeeze out and make margin improvement is going to be wrapped up in our Unified Plan 2020 of which, I mean, I don't think you can hear more confidence from the team here in terms of our ability to continue to drive efficient operations and drive productivity dollars, which will fall to the margin. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That makes sense. My second question is more kind of high level Jim. You've seen precision schedule railroading implemented a couple of times either directly or from a distance. And each time it's led to a fairly significant service disruption, which once gotten through, it becomes a weapon and a tool to improve service, but there's always that initial phase of service disruption. I'm hearing from Lance and perhaps I'll let you chime in, you're looking to do it this time without having that service disruption. What is going to happen? I mean, 10% workforce reduction, these kind of things lead me to believe that the customer is going to be affected. Can you help me get comfort that the comfort -- that the customer is not going to be affected with this time in terms of this movement to PSR? Jim Vena : So it's a \u2013 Walter, the history, you're correct. So let's not rewrite history. It's -- that's the way -- there was a lot of noise. I was involved with some of it and there was some noise. What we're doing here is we're trying to keep the noise down as much as possible being real smart about how we do it. Listen, I had a plan the first day I showed up. We wanted to park 500 locomotives. I didn't park 500 locomotives per state. I said let's work through this in a systematic way. We make it more efficient. We look at the touch points. We see where we are. I had a plan with Proviso from when I used to work at another company CN, okay? In Chicago, I went to visit Proviso. I didn't like that yard when I was on the other side. So it was going to happen, but we did it at the right time, right place and that's what it's all about, Walter. We're trying to do this in a systematic manner instead of holding it up and seeing what you can put together after all the pieces. So, hopefully we keep the noise as much. But Kenny knows, there's going to be some noise, and we talked about it. But I'll tell you what I give Kenny and the whole team a lot of credit. We're being proactive. We're getting out in front of it. We tell the customer what we're doing. We tell them what -- when we made the changes in accessorials, we told them. We gave them a chance to change their processes instead of just putting them in place. We're doing that specifically to try to keep them in. We understand how important the customer is to us. That's what drives our whole business model. So that's the way we're doing it, Walter. Walter Spracklin : Awesome. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks very much guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi, morning. Yeah, I just had a quick follow-up to the extent you can answer on the -- what you're doing in the intermodal complex in Chicago to improve the throughput and speed. Any sense that you could put on the timing of it, a little more specifically? Just curious because obviously the intermodal volumes of likely domestically have been on the softer side. I'm just wondering once that gets into place this is the second part of the question, is that when you could really start to more aggressively market the product? Would that be the plan? So that's why I'm curious about the timing of the whole complex improvement. Lance Fritz : Yeah. So Jordan I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Kenny and Jim to fill in more detail. So I think what you're referring to is really two different things that are occurring in Chicago : one, Jim mentioned earlier and that is consolidating and specializing our intermodal ramps. So, G3 focused on international intermodal, G2 focused on domestic intermodal and Yard Center focused on some specialty niches. That work is under way. G4 is -- or excuse me, I'm sorry, G4 focused on international. G3 has already been consolidated or is in the process into G4. G2 is in the process of being invested and also growing. So that's kind of an operational focus and that's a clear benefit to our customers. It simplifies the drayage equation and it provides a more consistent reliable service product. Second thing that's happened in Chicago is, we've rationalized service lanes in interchange with our interchange partners, both CSX and the NS at a high level and that's providing a more effective service product that's an interline service product. So the interchange happens more reliably, quicker. And you don't dwell boxes around ramps as long as you used to. So I'll let Kenny and Jim talk to how that impacts our customer base; what it looks like going forward. Kenny Rocker : Yes. And the only other thing I'll add is that, we have proactively worked with our customers to get the dwell down on our intermodal ramps at the destination. I mentioned this earlier, about 15 hours. So all of those three things of reduced complexity, the interline changes and the dwell has improved. But I'll tell you, we have worked with our customers. They are starting to see the benefit. We're looking at the service metrics and they are turning around. We have one of our -- group of our larger customers in and we've been talking to them. And they've expressed a very positive tone with this. So we feel very encouraged moving forward. Jim Vena : Last thing I would add is this. We want to look at our product, especially intermodal. We're talking intermodal end to end. So it's all about when the ship arrives at the port, how well we're able to move the containers out of the port, terminal that's international and how fast we can get it consistently to the customer so that they can use it. I think we build that model end to end. We're able to compete against everybody on the West Coast and on the South Coast to see what we can do to increase the business, because of the model we have, the facilities we have, we turn them quick. So I'm really excited. I think we're going to build a model that is as good or better than anybody out there in the marketplace. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. Kenny, could you give us a little bit more color on the down 2% volume? Should we sort of expecting the same variation across the product groups? Or is there any sort of additional insight you can give us into which traffic categories are going to -- what the trends by traffic category? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I mentioned the things earlier. We're going to just look at the trucking market here and see what happens. There still seems to be a lot of capacity out there. We can't control the foreign trade policy and we'll look at that. We talked about the comp getting better in our sand network, but we expect that to deteriorate a little bit more. But, again, having said all of that, the fact that our service will be improving, I like our chances to compete with truck more. The fact that we've reduced a lot of complexity out of our supply chain, gives us an opportunity to compete more. And we'll see what happens, but I like our chances. David Vernon : Okay. So, it's a little bit weaker in Premium and Energy, continuing to kind of be the weakest segment. Kenny Rocker : That's correct. Yes, that's right. David Vernon : Hey, Rob, just as a follow-up. I know you guys -- we talked a lot about margins and stuff like that, but if we look at the -- sort of the back half of the year, I think, consensus is expecting 11% EBIT growth. Given the 2% down volume, obviously, productivity is a little bit better in the back half of the year. Yes. Are you comfortable with an expectation of sort of like a 10% growth in EBIT line, just based on what you know right now with the down volume? It's really tough from the outside in to get the incremental and decremental, right? And, obviously, with the PSR thing happening at the same time, it's really confusing. I'm just trying to help our clients understand, kind of, what that trajectory and earnings growth should be, as opposed to just looking at the OR. Rob Knight : No, I get it, David, and I'll disappoint you in that we aren't going to give earnings guidance, as we don't. So, I mean, we're going to do as good as we can. And I think that you've heard us talk about the confidence that we have in driving margin improvement and how that turns out in terms of the earnings. We'll be as aggressive and hopefully as successful as we can. But I'm going to stay away from giving any earnings guidance. David Vernon : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just looking at the kind of head count cuts in the back half of the year, can you just help us understand, if this was kind of always part of the PSR plan? Or are you being more opportunistic given a softer volume environment to kind of make more cuts here while you can? Lance Fritz : Yes. I'll start with that. The short answer, Ravi, is we've always anticipated that labor would be a fairly large portion of our productivity savings for the year, which we've highlighted as plus $500 million net. So that's always been part of the expectation. If we do less work, we size the workforce for that less work. Rob Knight : But, yes, Ravi, I would add to that, that's the driver, that's the key drivers, is our confidence of the Unified Plan 2020. But given the fact that we have eyes on as best as we can at this point of the volume numbers that we gave for the back half, that we take that into consideration as well. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And just a follow-up. The Canadian rails have been really bullish on the international intermodal opportunity for the last couple of years and then going forward. Some of that kind of insinuates kind of some share shift from the U.S. ports, the Canadian ports. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing on the international intermodal side? And kind of do you see that as a secular shift in the industry? Lance Fritz : Kenny, can you take that? Kenny Rocker : Yes. We have seen over the last few years a little bit of share shift versus the West Coast. I'll tell you that, if you look at the weather issues that we faced, coming out of the couple of quarters of pent-up demand, we still feel pretty good about the fact that our international intermodal volume was up 1%. As we get back to a more stable economy, again, we still feel good about our opportunity to compete and grow that international intermodal business. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben Hartford : Hi. Thanks for the time here. Kenny, just wanted to follow up on the back half volume outlook. Just to clarify, in terms of how you guys are thinking about the cadence through the back half of the year. Do you expect it to return to a more normal seasonal volume cadence through year-end? And maybe in that same vein, what are you hearing as it relates to IMO 2020 plans from shippers, particularly in the international intermodal side? Any plans to pull forward ahead of that? And how do you think about the impacts there for a petro-chem product perspective? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So a couple of questions there. First I'll just say that, the things and some of the challenges will be what they are. We'll see what happens with the domestic trucking market. We'll see what happens with trade. We still feel very good, again, about the construction business that we have, the crude oil that we have. And the plastics business, we expect that to continue to grow. Everything that Jim is doing on the operating side, again allows us to compete. It allows us to get after rail-centric business that we lost during the floods, which allows us to increase a lot of the truck-centric business moving forward. So we feel positive about that. In terms of IMO 2020, we spent a lot of time with our international intermodal customers and we don't see anything significantly changing. We don't see anything from a pull ahead perspective changes. We don't see anything changing from a supply chain perspective, meaning that they might preference the Western port over an Eastern port. So, we haven't seen that. We've been talking to our customers all along the whole time. And right now, you shouldn't expect anything structural from what we're hearing. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thanks. And a quick follow-up. Jim, could you just provide a little bit of perspective on the changes in Chicago the reduction in ramps? It sounds like there's more to come as it relates to intermodal from a service standpoint. But when you think about that change, how pleased have you been? Do you expect any further changes around the Chicago area to be able to accomplish what you're alluding to on the intermodal side? Jim Vena : Listen, pretty straightforward. We've announced the changes that we're going to make there. I think that changes sets us up to have a great product within Chicago service that whole area and be able to stretch ourselves from Chicago to other markets. So, we're not changing anything. The time line is good. People are on board. Kenny has done a good job of explaining it to the customers. So, you'll see us make the change as we move forward. Some of the changes will take us a little bit longer five, six months to get them in place to be able to do that or up to a year, but we've got the plan there as we do in other places. Ben Hartford : Thank you. Jim Vena : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Hey Jim, we're seeing a lot of your efficiency metrics really start to move higher, particularly on the locomotive productivity in train linked departments. But the customer-facing metric your long-time performance versus your trip plan actually failed year-over-year, remains in the low 60% range. And what's probably pretty cost critical in workforce productivity feels like it's lagging a bit as well. In your prepared remarks, you said, car trip compliance had improved in July. Could you expand on that and speak to a sequential place of progress here with the weather behind you? And on both customer facing and the workforce productivity front, when might we start to see more stair step-like improvement? And what's going to drive that? Thank you. Jim Vena : Son of a gun. You're tough Bascome, okay? You hold me that, but I love the question. I appreciate it. So, if we take a look at workforce, it's -- we adjust for the work that we have to do and we've made some quick adjustments. And I think, we've done a good job of being smart about how we do it and you'll continue to see that. Rob has given the numbers of where we expect to be. I'm not going to add anything there. I don't need to add anything there. And as far as the productivity metrics in general, all of them, we think there's opportunity on them and we will continue to be productive in every one. We are touching. So, if you start with a car, how fast it moves for the customer and the weather had a big impact on us. So, what we did was, we didn't adjust the number. The number came in the way the number came in. We've got hit for the weather and we parked cars. We didn't make it to the customer. But, now that we're out of that, we've seen it's substantial. It's at least 10% higher our improvement and we'll continue to do that. We know we have to deliver a great product for our customers to be able to grow this and have been in the long term an efficient railroad and a great product for our customers. That's what it's all about Bascome. That's what we're trying to do. Lance Fritz : Bascome, so the moving parts on that service product, it's a mixed bag in the second quarter. Freight car velocity is a direct impact on customer experience, right? They're getting their cars more frequently from origin. Embedded in that, is terminal dwell. That's a direct impact. First OS launching on time has a direct impact. That car trip plan compliance that's a very specific holistic number that says from the time, the car was tendered to us that we do exactly that plan that day. And things like flooding made us use alternative routes and switch in different places. So, once we get a network that's smooth and steady and normal, we see the kind of thing that Jim is talking about which is a pretty quick snap back. It's a lagging indicator, but it is an indicator. And we expect that to go like the other service indicators are going. It just might take a little longer. Kenny Rocker : I can tell you just real quickly. We're sitting out with customers each week. And we're seeing an improvement. So, I want to give Jim and Lance and the team a pat on the back. We didn't talk about first mile, last mile, which we're also seeing a pretty significant jump in also and as a very tangible metric to customers. So, I -- we're expecting that to get better as we move along. Bascome Majors : It's great to hear about the substantial progress with the flooding behind you here. Rob any -- are we going to get an update from you guys on the long-term outlook next spring or summer like you normally do in the last year of a long-term plan? Any guidance on when that might happen? Thanks. Rob Knight : No. Stay tuned. We'll always update. As we said earlier on the call here, we'll be putting together our 2020 plans more firmly as -- between now and then and stay tuned. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. It's been a long call, so I'll just stick to one question and that is, you sound fairly confident that we're starting to move through the overhang associated with inventory pull forward in advance of tariff. So, I just wonder if you could elaborate on what you're hearing from customers or seeing in your carloads that influence that confidence. Kenny Rocker : Yes, I'll take that. First of all, what we're hearing one thing that's good is that, we are hearing that we're going to get a normal peak season volume here. So that lets us know that, a lot of the noise that we saw with the pull ahead is over. Again, we know what the domestic market is like. The only outlier that's out there from a trade perspective that probably impacts us is really just on the ag side and we talked about the soybean market. So, it really becomes a timing issue and we'll see what happens. Cherilyn Radbourne : That's helpful. Thank you. Kenny Rocker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : All right. Thanks Rob, and thank you all for your questions. To wrap it up, I want to again acknowledge the tenacity and the determination of Union Pacific's workforce. Hats off to them for producing great financial results in a pretty challenging quarter. And with that, we look forward to talking to you again in October. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. I have also asked Jennifer Hamann, our newly-appointed Chief Financial Officer effective January 1st, to join us for the Q&A portion of the call. So before we get started today, I want to take a moment and thank Rob for his service and contributions to Union Pacific over his 40-year career, particularly the last 16 years as CFO. Rob\u2019s been a critical member of our senior team and was instrumental in driving Union Pacific\u2019s financial success. We wish him all of the best in his upcoming well-deserved retirement and thank you very much, Rob. I also would like to welcome Jennifer to the CFO role. She and Rob are doing a great job working through the transition and I am confident that Jennifer is the right choice to lead our financial initiatives into the future.  This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2019 third quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.22 a share. This represents a 3% increase in earnings per share and a 2% decrease in net income compared to 2018. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at a 59.5%, a 2.2 percentage point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2018.  Once again, this represents an all-time record quarterly operating ratio, beating our previous low established last quarter. That\u2019s quite an achievement when you consider the fall-off in volume during the quarter. We are continuing to drive productivity through our G55 + 0 and Unified Plan 2020 efforts, which are also producing a safe, reliable and consistent service product for our customers. The work our employees are doing as part of Unified Plan 2020 is foundational to the company\u2019s success and there are additional improvement opportunities going forward for both our customers and our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was down 8% as gains in our Industrial business group were more than offset by declines in Ag Products, Premium and Energy. At the same time, we generated a positive net core pricing of 2.5% in the quarter as we continue to price our service product to the value it represents in the marketplace while ensuring it generates an appropriate return. Freight revenue was down 7%, driven by the decrease in volume partially offset by a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Starting off with Ag Products, revenue for the quarter was down 1% on a 2% decrease in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 3%, primarily driven by continued reductions in export grain shipments, partially offsetting feed grain declines with strength in wheat. Volume for grain products was flat as sustained demand for biofuels and supporting products was offset by reduced exports. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 5% primarily due to soft global demand for potash. Moving on to Energy, revenue was down 20% as volume declined 15%, coupled with a 5% decrease in average revenue per car related to negative mix with the loss of long-haul sand volume. Sand carloads were down 45%, largely due to the impact of local sand. Coal and coke volume was down 17%, due to the softer market conditions resulting from lower natural gas prices and weak export demand. In addition, contract changes and retirements also impacted volumes in the quarter. However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 18% increase in petroleum, LPG, and renewable carloads for the quarter. Industrial revenue was down 1% on a 2% increase in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car due to negative mix with increased short-haul business. Construction carloads increased 16%, primarily driven by a strong market demand in the south for rock shipments. Plastics volume increased 7% due to higher production. Forest product volume decreased 11% driven by softness in the lumber and paper markets. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 9% on an 11% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car improved by 2%. Domestic intermodal volume declined 11%, primarily driven by an abundant truck supply coupled with softer demand during the quarter. International intermodal volume was down 12% during the quarter, reflecting weak market conditions related to trade uncertainty, escalating tariffs, and challenging year-over-year comparisons, driven by accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff in September 2018. And finally, finished vehicle shipments were down 4% for the quarter. Third quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 2% from 2018. Strong light vehicle and SUV sales did not fully offset declining car demand. Looking ahead for the rest of 2019, for Ag Products, we anticipate continued strength in advanced biofuel shipments and associated feedstock due to an increase in demand, which will help offset challenges in the ethanol marketplace. We also expect stronger beer shipments along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business. And furthermore, with the recent outlook with China to take more Ag Products, we hope to see some relief as those exports resume. However, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on foreign tariffs within our Ag market. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. Local sand supply will continue to impact volume, although the comps should improve over the long term. We also expect coal to experience continued challenges with volume throughout the balance of the year and weather conditions will always be a key factor for coal demand. Looking at Industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments driven largely by plant expansions coming online later this year coupled with continued strength in the construction market in the South, but we continue to watch housing starts and the projected softness in the overall market. And lastly, for Premium, the light U.S. vehicle sales forecast for 2019 of 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. Although, we remain encouraged by the tentative agreement between General Motors and their autoworkers, we are still keeping a close watch on it and the associated volume impact. Domestic Intermodal volume is sequentially strengthening, but when compared to 2018, it is expected to be impacted by truck competition in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect international intermodal to return to its normal seasonal flow but face tough year-over-year comparisons due to accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff increases in 2018. And now, I will turn it over to Jim. Jim Vena : Thank you, Kenny. Well, we finally had a clean quarter from a weather perspective, and I think our results speak volumes for what is possible. Our operating metrics continue to improve and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of how the team has responded to the challenge of rightsizing our cost structure in the face of declining volumes while driving significant productivity. For example, crew starts were down 15% in the quarter and outpaced the 8% decline in carloads we experienced. This, along with our Unified Plan 2020 actions drove an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59.5%, which truly was a remarkable achievement. While we are continuing to drive productivity, these gains are overshadowed if we aren\u2019t simultaneously improving safety. Our incident experience has not improved, but we are committed to getting better, as always safety remains job one at Union Pacific. I\u2019d like to turn over to slide 11. I\u2019d now like to update you on our six key performance indicators. We continue to see substantial year-over-year improvement in our metrics. In fact, earlier this year, I said, we would blow by some of our goals and we are doing just that. It is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020. Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 20% improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 10% improvement in freight car velocity compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our train speed for the third quarter as a whole decreased 1% to 23.7 miles per hour compared to 2018. We turned the corner in September and saw year-over-year improvement and the trend has continued into October. As I have mentioned in the past, our train speeds continue to be affected by additional daily work events being performed as part of Unified Plan 2020. While these work events are helping us increase train size and drive asset utilization, there is an opportunity to execute these work events even more efficiently and drive faster train speeds. Turning to slide 12, continuing our trend from the second quarter, locomotive productivity improved 18% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of September 30th, we had around 2,600 locomotives stored. Driven by a 13% decrease in our workforce levels, workforce productivity increased 4% year-over-year. In addition to improving productivity, delivering a great service product is of equal importance to the team, car trip compliance improved 10 points year-over-year driven by increased freight car velocity and lower terminal dwell. While we are pleased with our progress, we do expect our service product to improve going forward. In fact, we are already seeing sequential improvement in October. Slide 13 highlights some of the recent network changes we have made as part of Unified Plan 2020. By shifting classification work to surrounding terminals we are able to reduce operations at our Roseville hump yard resulting in increased car velocity for associated manifest business. In addition, we reduced switching operations at our yard in Alexandria, Louisiana, moved the work to a more efficient terminal in Livonia. We also stopped humping cars at Neff yard in Kansas City. As a result, we will now build overhead blocks to drive cars deeper into the network and leverage existing flat switching terminals in the Kansas City Complex. Going forward, we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches, which undoubtedly will lead to additional terminal rationalization opportunities on our network. Currently, one of our main areas of focus is to utilize our existing network capacity, and we are making excellent progress on this front as illustrated by the train length graph on the right. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by over a thousand feet or 15% since January of this year. In fact, we have specific initiatives up against the Sunset, Central, and North-South corridors on our network and they are paying big dividends. Earlier this year, we discussed investing capital in our Sunset Corridor for siding extensions to support productivity initiatives. Through a collaborative team effort, that work was completed in record time. As a result, I am pleased to report the train length in the Sunset Corridor has increased 18% since January 2019. Furthermore, operational changes in our North-South Corridor between Chicago and South Texas have driven train length up over 21% since the start of the year. Looking forward, I expect to see continued improvement in train length through a combination of transportation plan changes and targeted capital investments. To wrap up, on slide 14, we have made a number of changes to our operations in the last year and the results have been outstanding. However, there are still a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. As we move forward, look for us to continue pushing the envelope and taking bold steps as we transform our operation, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for both our customers and our shareholders is nonnegotiable, and our team is committed to making that happen.  And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for the last time. Rob Knight : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Today we are reporting third quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and a 2.2 points of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio to 59.5%. This represents an all-time best quarterly operating ratio for Union Pacific and the second consecutive quarter with a sub-60% operating ratio. This is once again a testament to the great work that we are doing with G55 + 0 and the Unified Plan 2020. Our quarterly results were affected by some one-timers, so before I jump into the details, let me set the stage. An increased frequency of rail equipment incidence resulted in approximately $25 million of added operating expenses in the quarter. These excess costs for cleanup, destroyed equipment and damaged freight resulted in a 0.5 point negative impact to our operating ratio and subtracted $0.02 of EPS compared to the third quarter of 2018. The combined impact of lower fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a favorable impact for the quarter of 0.9 points on the operating ratio adding $0.04 of EPS compared to 2018. The good news is that despite lower volumes, we drove core margin improvement of almost 2 points compared to the third quarter of last year. Now let\u2019s recap our third quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. The primary driver was an 8% decrease in volume. Operating expense totaled $3.3 billion, down 10% from 2018. Operating income totaled $2.2 billion, a 2% decrease compared to last year. Below the line, other income was $53 million, up 10% from 2018 driven by lower benefit plan costs and increased rental income, partially offset by higher environmental costs. Interest expense of $266 million was up 10% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of a higher total debt balance. Income tax expense decreased 4% to $466 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.1% and for the full year we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 23.5%. Net income totaled $1.6 billion, down 2% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance decreased 5% as a result of our continued share repurchases. As I noted earlier, these results combined to produce third quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and an operating ratio of 59.5%. Freight revenue of $5.1 billion was down 7% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $393 million, down $89 million compared to 2018. Business mix had almost a 1 point negative impact on freight revenue in the third quarter, driven by increased shorter-haul rock business and decreased agricultural product volumes, along with reduced sand carloadings, somewhat offset by fewer intermodal shipments. Core price was 2.5% in the third quarter, similar to the pricing that we achieved in the first half of 2019. Although, the reported yields are slightly lower, this is not indicative of any quarterly pricing actions. As you have heard me say many times before, in order to get credit for price under our methodology, which we believe is the right way to calculate price, you have to move the volumes. In the third quarter, the fall-off in volumes negatively impacted our price yield. Having said that, beginning with our fourth quarter results, we will no longer report detailed pricing numbers. We are making this change solely for commercial reasons as Union Pacific is the only Class 1 railroad to publically report detailed pricing results, which we now believe disadvantages us in the marketplace. This should not be read in any way as Union Pacific becoming less disciplined or less focused on pricing. Of course, price will continue to play a key role in achieving our financial goals and our guidance is unchanged, and rest assured, we will continue to yield pricing dollars above our rail inflation costs. Slide 19 provides a summary of our core -- of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 10% to $1.1 billion versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total force levels, which were down 13% or about 5,700 FTEs in the third quarter versus last year. Productivity initiatives along with lower volumes resulted in a 13% decrease in our TE&Y workforce, while our management, engineering and mechanical workforces together declined 15%. Fuel expense totaled $504 million, down 24% compared to 2018 due to lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed. Average diesel fuel prices decreased 12% versus last year to $2.09 per gallon and our consumption rate improved 3% through more efficient operations. Purchase services and materials expense was down 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2018 at $574 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the quarter were reduced mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, partially offset by reduced foreign car repairs. Turning to slide 20, depreciation expense was $557 million, up 2% compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, we still expect that depreciation expense will be up 1% to 2%. Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $236 million in the quarter, which is down 13% when compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower equipment lease expense and less volume related costs. Other expense was down 3%, compared to the third quarter of 2018 at $277 million, driven by lower environmental expenses partially offset by an increase in costs associated with damaged freight and destroyed equipment. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up low-single digits compared to 2018. Productivity savings yielded from our G55 + 0 initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately $170 million in the quarter, which was partially offset by the additional costs that I mentioned in my opening remarks. As a result, net productivity for the third quarter was $145 million, with year-to-date net productivity now sitting at $375 million. This is a remarkable outcome when you think about the challenges that we have overcome such as unprecedented flooding and a weak volume environment. In fact, we continue to gain traction with our productivity initiatives and are confident that we will still deliver at least $500 million of net productivity in 2019. Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters totaled $6.3 billion, down slightly compared to last year. Free cash flow before dividends totaled $3.8 billion resulting in free cash flow conversion rate equal to 83% of net income for the first three quarters of 2019. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $28 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $2.9 billion since year end 2018. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times. As we have previously guided, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times. Dividend payments for the first three quarters totaled more than $1.9 billion, up $209 million from 2018. This includes the effect of 10% dividend increases in both the first quarter and third quarter of this year. During the third quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares at a cost of $1.1 billion. We also received 3.2 million shares in the third quarter associated with the closeout of the $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in February. But between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $7.1 billion to our shareholders in the first three quarters of this year. Looking out to the remainder of 2019, with the current softness in rail volumes and the underlying economic uncertainty in the marketplace, we expect fourth quarter volumes to decline year-over-year at a similar level to what we experienced in the third quarter. Clearly, we would love to have additional volume, with a more consistent and reliable service product we are poised to grow our business. Going forward, we will continue to price our service to the value that it represents in the marketplace, while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return. We remain confident that the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation costs in 2019. With respect to capital investments, we now expect full year 2019 spending to be around $3.1 billion or about $100 million less than our previously announced $3.2 billion plan. Although, we are continuing to invest in projects that support the Unified Plan 2020 productivity initiatives, we have scaled back some of our growth capital spend in light of current business volumes. As it relates to our workforce, strong productivity initiatives and to a lesser degree lower volumes have resulted in a 9% year-to-date reduction. For the balance of the year, we expect continued combination of operating efficiency gains and lower business levels should result in fourth quarter force levels to be down at least 15% versus 2018. As a result, full-year force levels should be down slightly more than 10%, which positions us nicely going into 2020. Importantly, with improving margins in the second half of the year, our guidance of a sub-61% operating ratio in 2019 on a full year basis remains intact, despite the fall-off in volumes. Furthermore, an early look at next year\u2019s productivity lineup gives us confidence, with our ability to achieve an operating ratio below 60% for 2020. As you have heard me say many times before, we have to play the hand that we are dealt when it comes to volumes. But let me assure you, our commitment to achieving our financial targets is unwavering and we are moving aggressively to improve regardless of the economic environment. Before I turn it back to Lance, if you can indulge me for just one minute. As was said, this is my final earnings call and I want to thank all the men and women of Union Pacific for the dramatic improvements in safety, service and financial results over the last 16 years. I am very proud that we have improved our operating ratio 28 points, increasing our market cap by over $100 billion over that time and I am confident that the team will continue to drive great results as we drive to a 55 operating ratio. I have never felt better about the path that we are on operationally and I also know that Jennifer will be an outstanding CFO. And finally, I would like to thank everyone listening today for all the professionalism and support that you have given me and Union Pacific and I wish you all the best. With that, I will turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered solid third quarter financial results and we made tremendous strides to improve our productivity and service product as part of Unified Plan 2020. For the remainder of 2019, we look forward to building on our successes and we provide a highly consistent and reliable service product for our customers. Although, there are some unknowns looking ahead at the economy, confidence in our operational capabilities, as Rob just mentioned, has never been greater. As always, we are committed to operating a safe railroad for our employees and the communities that we serve and we have some work to do there. We remain squarely focused on driving long-term shareholder value by appropriately investing in the railroad and returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning. And I will start with a congrats to Rob and Jennifer on the announcement. Maybe to start on headcount, if we just look at the guidance for the fourth quarter and take the exit rate this year and hold that steady, it seems to imply another 6% reduction or so in the headcount in 2020, if you just hold things flat sequentially throughout next year. I know it\u2019s somewhat volume dependent, but should we be thinking about a 6% reduction in the headcount at a minimum for next year, and can you just speak to the opportunity beyond that level as you continue to implement PSR? Rob Knight : Yeah. Justin, this is Rob. We haven\u2019t finalized our 2020 plan, and so volume will obviously have a role in what the headcount actually ends up being, but we are confident in that and we are hopeful that volume is positive, and we will grow that very efficiently from a productivity standpoint. Having said that, you are right, we are exiting at a very efficient level. We are gaining momentum with the Precision Rail Unified Plan 2020 initiatives that Jim talked about. So, directionally, I think you are thinking about it right, we are not guiding to that number, but that directionally is exactly what we are thinking. Justin Long : Okay. And then maybe secondly more of a near-term question. Last couple of years, we have seen the OR stay fairly flat sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter. Should we be thinking about the OR staying flattish sequentially in 4Q of this year as well or is there something that could cause a divergence from that trend we have seen in the past couple of years? Rob Knight : Yeah. We are not giving quarterly guidance on that, but I think directionally also there you are thinking about it right and I gave you sort of an early look at what we expect to see on the volume front, which I think would be a similar decline in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third quarter. So there\u2019s nothing unusual outside of that. We are obviously going to continue to implement the Unified Plan 2020 initiatives and do as good as we can, but you are thinking about it directionally right. Justin Long : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Justin. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks. Good morning and congrats to Rob and Jennifer. Rob, it\u2019s been great working with you. Wish you all the best in your retirement. I guess I wanted to come back to the headcount dynamic, certainly a 15% reduction in the fourth quarter is dramatic and a big, big number. I guess when you think about sort of when you set the target for 10% decline earlier this year relative to what we have seen from a volume perspective, you can make an argument that obviously volume has sort of disappointed I guess. So, how do you feel about sort of the balance between your resources and what we are seeing from a volume perspective? Is there opportunity, I am coming at this question, I guess, slightly similarly to Justin, but kind of a little bit different. Is there an opportunity to kind of get a little bit more aggressive on the headcount as we kind of go through this 4Q, 1Q kind of hopefully bottoming in volume? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Chris, this is Lance. Without putting a really fine point on it, the short answer is largely yes, right? We have been a little disappointed in the topline versus what we were hoping to see when we came into the year. As a result, we have adjusted headcount more aggressively to match that drop in volume. You see that happening in the third quarter as we had headcount lower than volume, and I expect we will continue that. Jim, do you want to add a little technicolor in terms of some of the opportunities that you see in the operations? Jim Vena : I think the numbers speak for themselves. Lance, I think, the team did a great job of taking into account where the volume ended up this quarter and what we were able to react, and we are going to do the same thing. We are going to react to -- on any volume. Hopefully, the volume goes up. But at the end of it, we will react in the right way and we see a sequential drop in the number of people that we have as we move forward against the flat line business model. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful and I appreciate that. Can we talk a little bit about the topline and yield specifically. I guess from a yield standpoint, some sequential deterioration here. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the competitive pricing environment that you are dealing with in your markets, and then maybe some of the mix dynamics that are kind of working their way through? Is there any predictability to the mix as we look out to 4Q or maybe 1Q, can you sort of highlight that, but those kind of dynamics around yield would be very helpful. Lance Fritz : Before I turn it over to, Kenny, I just want to remind everybody, Rob said this, that we calculate yield in the most conservative way, and so when you get a 10% or an 8% drop in volume in the quarter, it has a real significant impact on our ability to generate yield. And Rob, again, had said very specifically that there was nothing specific in the quarter that drove yield sequentially to decline just a little bit. But with that, Kenny, do you want to talk about the pricing environment that you are in right now? Kenny Rocker : So, first of all, I just want to give a shout out to Jim, wishing the operating team for creating an environment where we can price to a really strong service product out there. So our commercial team is doing a really good job of keeping pricing discipline and aligning our price consistent with that service offering that\u2019s improving. Having said all those things, there is a very competitive truck environment that is out there. I think all of you are aware of what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace and we complete -- compete daily with a number of rail carriers in North America. But I think the important thing for you to hear is that we are going to maintain pricing discipline especially as our service products is improving and as that service product improves, we also expect that to help us grow. Lance Fritz : Rob, do you want to touch on mix? Rob Knight : Yeah. Chris, as you know, we don\u2019t give guidance on mix and the reason for that is we have such a diverse product mix that we have mix within mix. You have heard me say that many times. Having said that, the challenges, and perhaps, to some, the surprise in the third quarter mix was I think largely explained by the increase in the shorter-haul rock shipments that we called out. I mean, intermodal, I think, everybody gets that. Most of the other moves like Ag everybody kind of gets that. The shorter-haul rock shipments that increased I think were perhaps a little bit of a surprise to some on the mix. Having said that, I see no reason why the fourth quarter wouldn\u2019t -- would be materially different from what we saw in the third quarter. Again, I am going to stay away from specific mix guidance, but directionally I would envision it looking similar. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks very much. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning, and Rob, yeah, also congratulations, wish you the best, pleasure working with you over the years and congratulations to you as well, Jennifer. The -- let\u2019s see, the volume trend, I mean, obviously there are a lot of moving parts and the weakness in volume. But I think it\u2019s notable that there\u2019s a pretty big delta in volume performance for Union Pacific versus Burlington Northern. And just wanted to see if you could shed some light on what might be driving that, in particular, I am referring to the intermodal where it looks like kind of four-week moving average you are down about 13%, BN is down about 2% and there is a pretty wide gap in the coal side as well. So just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on what\u2019s driving that and whether you think that might change over the next couple quarters? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I will tell you that we would have appreciated a stronger economy to help us compete for more opportunities. But the fact that the service product on the intermodal side is actually strengthening is something that we appreciate. And yes, we have seen a lot of competition out there from both the trucking side, and as always, we compete with the western rail carriers and the North American rail carriers. So that has going to be around for us and we will continue to compete there. Lance Fritz : Yeah. One thing that I would add, Tom, is we are very happy with our service product and the trend that it\u2019s on. So it\u2019s currently a very good service product and it\u2019s showing itself to be reliable and consistent, and I think it\u2019s going to continue to improve. So from that basis, we are in a great place to compete for business. Having said that, we are also continuing to be a very, very disciplined on our price. So we are not trying to chase market share, we are not trying to chase the market down against loose truck, and we will just compete based on the service that we provide, we will price for that. And as the economy strengthens, which it will at some point and as truck capacity tightens up, which it will at some point, we are in a great place to take advantage of that. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Just, I guess to follow-up on that a little bit further, are there contract shifts in the intermodal and coal side that might account for part of that and I guess in terms of the PSR impact, sometimes you make big changes to, as an example, in Chicago, the terminals you are using and you can cause some initial disruption to the customer but then obviously you hope to run better in the future. But is there an impact from contracts or kind of initial disruption from PSR? Jim Vena : Yeah. Chris, I will take that, a mix of questions. The short answer is in terms of design of our network in the intermodal space. There has been small single-digit impact on intermodal volume from rationalizing low volume lanes, low density lanes. That made sense in the book of business. It still makes sense. And when you aggregate that back up to the entire railroad, it\u2019s really largely an asterisk.  When you get into the other parts of your question about contracts, we don\u2019t talk specifically about customers, but I -- but we did call out both in the first quarter, and I think, Kenny mentioned it again this quarter that, we did have a coal contract change hands that is impacting this year to a degree and we haven\u2019t talked about any other contracts precisely. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : All right. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So want to ask a couple on the cost side, comp per employee a little higher than we thought, any thoughts on how to model that going forward and rail inflation next year? And then purchase services were flat sequentially given the weak volumes and PSR. I would have thought there would be some opportunity there, maybe can you just talk about the opportunity that is left on purchase services cost? Rob Knight : Yeah. Scott, this is Rob. Let me take the cost per employee. The -- kind of delta, if you rose, as to why it was up above what we would expect in terms of the inflation was really some of the overtime which a lot of changes going on in operations but the overtime is something that did inflate that cost per employee up a little bit. As we look to 2020, again we haven\u2019t finalized our planning assumptions yet, but I would say, it\u2019s probably overall inflation for 2020 is going to be in the neighborhood of 2%, with labor probably in the 2.5-ish range again. And on the purchase services, I guess I wouldn\u2019t call out anything unique there, obviously, as we pursue the Unified Plan 2020 initiatives there will be opportunities we think for us to continue to rationalize and be as efficient as we can on that line as well. Scott Group : Okay. And then we got the sub-60 OR guidance for next year. Rob or Jennifer or maybe Jim, if you want to comment, the street is already well ahead of that. Given the macro, does that seem reasonable or -- and then maybe asking it a little bit differently. So when we have looked at past instances of rails doing PSR, you have seen better margin improvement in the second year than the first year. Does that seem like a reasonable way to think about it or not? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Let me start, Scott, and then I will hand it over to Rob and Jim. So the bottomline for next year is we have got guidance out there sub-60, but we have constantly said we are going to be as sub-sub-60 as we possibly can be. As we enter next year, we have got good momentum, right? If we can get a little cooperation from the economy, that would be very helpful. We have had some puts and takes this year. We have discussed those through the quarter, so we know what those are. But we are going to get as sub of 60 as we possibly can. And with that, I will turn it over to Rob and Jim to fill in. Rob Knight : Yeah. Scott, I would just add to that that, as you know, every step on the ladder of efficiency that we have had over the years we have always tried to get there as safely and efficiently and quickly as we can, and frankly we have. So I would say that\u2019s similar to the numbers that we have out there. I feel, as I said in my comments, I feel as good as I have ever felt in my career about where we are operationally. So the things that I feel like we can control to get to that sub-60, I feel extremely good about. So the variable right now as I look to 2020 is really the economy, and as we sit right here today, we are certainly hopeful and thinking that the volume will be on the maybe slightly on the positive side of the ledger, but that\u2019s still an unknown at this point. So I think that\u2019s really the big variable as to how sub, sub can be on that sub-60 guidance for next year. Jim Vena : Listen, the only thing I can add, I think, Lance and Rob have done a great job of giving the macro view of it. Operationally, we are just starting. I think, there\u2019s lots to do. I think, I have been here for nine months, a couple of days ago. I think what the team has been able to deliver and you see it in the metrics that are real key. I think -- I don\u2019t think, I know, next year is going to be a great year operationally. We will take whatever business. Hopefully it\u2019s an increase in business, and Kenny, a substantial increase. And we will show what this team can do, and if not, we react to it properly. I see lots of headway and I am excited by what I see coming forward for the end of this year and next year. Scott Group : Jim, can I just clarify one thing with you? So, you -- at the beginning of the year you laid out a 10% labor productivity target. We are getting a lot of headcount out, but because volumes are down so much, like, we are getting maybe half of that on the labor productivity. So does that imply that there\u2019s a big opportunity left next year, are we thinking about that right? Jim Vena : I think, we are headed in the right direction. You are thinking right. We are -- the more we can put, the less train starts, put more product on the trains, make it more efficient, adjust our yards just like we did in Kansas City, we drive productivity better, we will see that improve as we move ahead, Scott. So nothing wrong with the way you are thinking. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks to everyone. And Rob, good luck on your retirement and congratulations, Jen, from me as well. So it was pretty that you are no longer going to announce core price. I think that now makes every Class 1 rail that doesn\u2019t disclose price. That\u2019s a pretty dramatic change from five years or six years ago, where that was kind of key to the rail kind of bouquet as investment pieces. Why do you think that\u2019s changed, I mean, is that because it\u2019s just gotten more competitive to get price, is it because of a tougher regulatory environment? Why have you seen that shift do you think? Lance Fritz : So I can\u2019t speak for other railroads. I can speak for us. And that is by publishing a yield number every quarter. We work against ourselves commercially. I mean, in the simplest way, when Kenny is talking to a customer and trying to maximize that price discussion, our conservative yield calculation frequently works against us in that conversation. It\u2019s as simple as that for us. Rob? Rob Knight : Yeah. Ravi, I would just add, Lance nailed it, but I would add, as I said in my comments, you are right, it is a shift. But I think, as I exit the company, I also have never felt better about the understanding and value of understanding the impact that the pricing has on our financials. And you combine that with the continually improving service product, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Kenny and the marketing team completely understand that it\u2019s our objective to drive as positive a price and earn the adequate returns that we can in the marketplace. So rest assured, I guess, the point is, rest assured that, because we think commercially it\u2019s not to our advantage to be talking as precisely as we have about price, don\u2019t interpret that to mean that we are not aggressively going after pricing opportunities, which we think are still there and we are going to aggressively pursue that. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Just a follow-up. Lance, I think, you said earlier that, you guys are very clearly not chasing share and going after volume over price. Just given some of the volume delta this quarter between you and your chief regional competitor, do you feel like there is some of that going on in the marketplace? Lance Fritz : Our marketplace, as we relay to you every quarter, it remains very competitive and it remains competitive specifically in the intermodal space not just against rail competition, but specifically against truck competition. Trucks are pretty darn loose right now, which means the capacity is readily available and widely reported that truck pricing has been dropping. So we are looking forward to seeing a bottom of that and then an upturn. And I anticipate that will occur. I don\u2019t know when. But you see truck orders substantially down, you see production starting to turn negative and that all bodes well for competition as we look forward. Rob Knight : And the best way to combat that is an improved service product and that\u2019s what we are getting right now. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and again, congrats, Rob and Jennifer. Just going back to the volume side for a minute, we have easier comps here in 2020. What do you feel, Kenny, about the absolute activity levels and maybe some of the key areas to talk about? You just mentioned truck, but honestly, I am a little surprised that that\u2019s been such a factor, so maybe you can help expand on that? And then while we have talk about sand for a long time, it continues to go down. I just wanted to see when you mentioned the long-term comps get easier, is there still a big shift in local sand that\u2019s coming up that you think is going to be a mix headwind as well? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So, first of all, it\u2019s a little premature for us to talk about the plan for the following year. But, yeah, I would expect that we would be on the slightly positive side of the ledger. As we look towards the future and the fact that we have got a good service product really helps us out. When you look at the sand business, yeah, that local sand penetration has been with us now for a good 18 months. I will tell you that I would expect that those comparisons to slow over time. So maybe not the immediate near-term, but over the longer term, it certainly should, those comparisons should get easier for us. Brian Ossenbeck : And then to follow-up on the trucking side, because I feel like you didn\u2019t get as much benefit when the cycle was tight, so a little surprised to hear that it\u2019s a bit of an overhang here in some of the markets? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. We are keeping an eye on the trucking market. Over the last couple months and even over the last couple weeks, we are seeing it firm up a little bit. We are also keeping an eye on what will happen in terms of a peak season out there because there is some interplay between our domestic business and our international business. But right now, we would really appreciate more help from the overall economy. Brian Ossenbeck : Got it. Then just one quick one for Lance. Can you just give us your view on regulatory environment and do you see, it still feels like it\u2019s a little more active, not necessarily active from that perspective. But are we certainly seeing a lot of movement in a few different areas than we have with labor negotiation that\u2019s starting up, which I appreciate you probably can\u2019t say too much on that. But just want since there\u2019s a lot coming between now and the end of the year just kicking off here, I just wanted to get your thoughts on topics more generally? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Sure. So let\u2019s take them in two pieces. I will start with the regulatory environment. So the STB is poised to be fully staffed with five Board members in the not too distant future. And they have already started getting more active on a host of items that they are pursuing, either old items on the docket that just weren\u2019t handled over the course of the last five years and in some cases new items. Our posture is we are continually engaged with the STB to help them understand what some of the negative impacts could be of some of the regulations that are being considered and also help them understand that each regulation can\u2019t really be taken on its own. It forms a mosaic of regulatory impact. And the end game for the railroads for the STB is to make sure that the railroads are healthy and can continue to invest capital in the railroads so that we have a robust infrastructure to support the United States. So we constantly are having dialogue and communication about current state of the railroad. How good the service product is? What we are working on? And what the risks are of some of the regulations that are being considered. In terms of our negotiation with labor, you did see that there was a lawsuit filed against the Smart TD. That was to compel that specific union to negotiate on crew consist or at least consider that through arbitration as a negotiating item. That it was -- it\u2019s a technical matter and I look forward to that being addressed through the courts. The end of the current moratorium is November 1. So sometime around that time frame, unions are free to put demands on the railroad management teams and railroad management is free to put demands for negotiating on unions. I anticipate that\u2019s going to happen. I anticipate it\u2019s going to be a robust negotiating season and I look forward to that, and I look forward to be able to work with our unions to continue to position Union Pacific as a competitive strong supporter of the U.S. economy. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thank you, Lance. Appreciate that. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask firstly about the profit potential, as volumes and revenue get better, some of the huge progress you have made on the cost side is, obviously, being masked a little bit by the revenue environment. So just in that context, when we do get back to revenue growth, hopefully, as soon as possible, probably, next year, can all of that incremental revenue drop to the bottom line, just help us think about the cost in the business whether structural or variable and how those -- which of those would have to increase once revenue growth kind of moves from negative to positive? Rob Knight : Amit, this is Rob. I think you are spot on. We would love nothing more than to see volume be as positive as possible and there obviously are some direct volume variable costs that would come on Board with that, but at a very productive level. But I think you hit the nail on the head, and that is we are well-positioned now as volume does return for the incremental margins to be impressive, because there is no, I mean, we won\u2019t have to add back the costs that we have been able to right-size and achieve through the Unified Plan 2020, so the efficiencies and the incremental margins, to your point, from the incremental volume that comes on Board should be extremely efficient. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Jim Vena : That\u2019s where that work that the operating team has been doing on train size really pays off and when we talk about train size opportunity into the future, volume growth is just going to be our friend. Amit Mehrotra : Right. And that\u2019s a good segue into my next question or follow-up question on the operating stats. The train length progress has been really impressive. I think it\u2019s like 8,000 feet or maybe a little bit more now. What -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a question for Lance or Jim, but what\u2019s the upper limit there, I mean, can you get to 10,000? How quickly can you increase that and have you made enough -- I know you made a bunch of investments reallocated some capital towards extending sidings earlier this year. Is that all done where now you can continue to grow that, just talk about how quickly you can continue to grow that because the progress there has obviously been impressive? Lance Fritz : Well, thanks for the feedback, Amit. Listen, the team has done a great job. You don\u2019t change from a 7,000 foot railroad to an 8,000 foot railroad in nine months without touching a lot of places. We have a great network. So that\u2019s what\u2019s nice about as business comes, which it\u2019s going to come, we drive more of it to the bottomline because the costs are not going to go up 1 to 1. In fact, I\u2019d be very interested to see what happens when the business goes up next year.  Second is we will invest -- we found some places in this network that we need to invest and we will invest and make sure the same as we have done on the Sunset to increase train size and be more fluid and have less trains running with more product on it. The upper limit, I don\u2019t guess. It\u2019s a traffic mix depending on what kind of traffic you have. We have some traffic that is very tough to build big trains with just because of origin and destination and others we have the possibility to be able to increase them. So I continue to see improvement. I know what other railroads have had the capability of doing, one that I worked at. So I think we will buy that number that they have had without an issue next year as we build this infrastructure even better and harden it. Rob Knight : There is one last thing to note here, and it\u2019s lost on a lot of people. It\u2019s a benefit of the train design that we have got Unified Plan 2020 and that is much more of our volume is running in mixed manifest traffic now. Kenny talks about it from the perspective of that\u2019s enabling us to win business that we used to pass on because it wasn\u2019t conducive to a unique boutique train. Well, in the old days, if 40% or 45% of our network was in the manifest world, that number is looking more like two-thirds and three-quarters, which means volume can grow across different segments and we can leverage it into train size, whereas that opportunity to do that historically was probably a little more limited. So that\u2019s a big benefit of the Unified Plan 2020. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Rob, congrats. I hope you don\u2019t miss these calls and our questions too much. Thanks so much. Rob Knight : Actually, I will miss it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A question for you, I know the network is in good shape for the incremental margin next year, volumes snapped back. Question, though, on the headcount front, can you gear up quickly or would you need to gear up quickly given how much reduction you have had so that you can ensure the operations from that perspective will run smoothly? Lance Fritz : Yeah. I am going to at the highest level say, yes. We have changed a number of things that make our ability to be more agile on both the upside and the downside. But on the upside, our time to hire and train and bring out a crew, a conductor, has been cut dramatically. We are actually looking forward to the next time we have to add conductors to exercise that new muscle. Jim, there are some other things we have been doing. What are your thoughts? Jim Vena : Lance, I think, you hit it right on the nail. The bottomline is, is I don\u2019t think we have to increase. We have an increase in business. We are not going to increase on a same percentage as we go up or going to become more efficient. It helps us become even more efficient. I think we have shown what we could do this quarter. When you have this kind of an adjustment in volume and for us to drop 5,700 FTEs in the third quarter shows that we have got the capability to make the right adjustments when the business level is and a lot of that cut was because of the efficiencies that we built into the system. So I am looking forward to what happens the next few months and into the next year and I am very excited about it. I think the numbers will dictate a great result for this company moving forward. Jordan Alliger : Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on intermodal, we keep hearing that service is much better from various folks out there on the rails. You guys as well intermodally. So when you talk to your customers, I mean, is it truly a price spread between what you offer versus trucks that\u2019s going to get the needle to move back to positive volumes, and if so, what sort of -- pick a length of haul, what sort of spread versus trucks percentage wise, let\u2019s say, induces a shipper to move the volume to rail, especially given the service and what have the discounts narrowed to now, if you have any input on that? Thanks. Jim Vena : Yeah. You are right on that service has improved and our customers are realizing that and it will take a while. I mean, we are talking about a few months now where our service has really turned a corner from the weather event. The spot rates have now lowered. They are less than 20% from the highs where they were over 25% last year in terms of being depressed. In terms of where we need to be in that delta, we have always said that we would like to be from the contracting rates anywhere from 10% to 15% lower than the contracted rates and so we will continue to see what happens in the marketplace going forward. Lance Fritz : Hey, Jordan. This is Lance. Two points, one that the truck capacity, overcapacity of truck supply really needs to get adjusted for those spot rates and contract rates to start going back up. And then the second thing to note is, our service product consistent, reliable, over a period of time will start convincing customers who have historically split their book of business but would have benefited by putting more on rail to put more on rail. So over time, theoretically, I think, we should see more opportunity as opposed to less even in the status quo environment. Jim Vena : I think the important thing is that we are already seeing wins. The commercial team is already putting together some wins out there that are specific to UP 2020 and so the expectation is that that will continue as we move forward in the next year. Jordan Alliger : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. And Rob, obviously, congrats and really enjoyed working with you through all the years, and to Jen on your new role of finding a way to talk to analysts again. Just a great call so far on the big picture, but maybe, Kenny, if I can just drill down maybe a little nearer term here, looks like we have started off the quarter even worse than the run rate that you are highlighting that the fourth quarter should look like third quarter, particularly at Energy and Premium, which are down 18%, 13% with the quarter now down 11%, so a bit worse than third quarter. Is there anything you would put that on flood, snow, anything you look to turn around on easier comps as we move forward? Lance Fritz : Yeah. If you look at it, clearly we have some tough comps. I think we all remember some of the pull aheads that we were faced on the intermodal side especially with our international intermodal, and clearly, natural gas is in a different place than it was around the same time last year. So structurally those are two fundamental issues that are there. We will continue to also keep an eye on what\u2019s going on in the automotive industry. Our Detroit team is working with GM, and although, we didn\u2019t see a significant impact in the third quarter, we are going to be working with them and all the auto players to see the impacts that it\u2019s having early on in the fourth quarter. Ken Hoexter : Okay. But just to, I guess, understand that, the pull ahead would make it even tougher comps. So you are saying that was maybe an earlier quarter event so it gets easier as the quarter rolls on? Lance Fritz : No. What I am saying is that those comps are impacting what you are seeing in terms of the delta that we are down. Ken Hoexter : Okay. L For this quarter. Yeah. Jim Vena : Since start\u2026 Lance Fritz : Since start\u2026 Jim Vena : Since start of the quarter. Ken Hoexter : Yeah. All right. And then, Jim, great slide on kind of the newer moves on kind of continued rationalization. Are there maybe your thoughts on additional yards or is it incremental from this point forward as you have cleaned out the humps, just trying to see if there are any more step function improvements that you see as you move into 2020? Jim Vena : I think, if you look at what we are trying to do, it\u2019s a great question, because I look at it holistically for the whole company, not just looking at numbers of what we are doing. All we are trying to do is move cars as fast as possible, remove the touch points and give better service product and that\u2019s what we are doing. And this is a winning game, so we drop our operating, we have become the most efficient railroad in North America, we are able to then compete against everybody. So what I see out there is we just started. We are truly baseball season, great time of the year, maybe not if you are a Yankee fan right now, a little tough, but at the end of it, I think, that we are early innings and we still have a lot to do productivity-wise in this company, and stay tuned, and we will move ahead and I will announce them as we are ready to go. Ken Hoexter : All right. Great. I think the Yankees would say it\u2019s still early. So thanks a lot, guys. Jim Vena : I was waiting for that. I was waiting for that comeback. Appreciate it. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate the time, guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. And congrats to Rob and Jennifer. Maybe, Jim, just following up on your recent comments about productivity. Could you maybe give us your initial thoughts on what this could look like in 2020 given that the improvement in the key metrics have really accelerated here recently? And maybe without asking you to put a specific number on it, because there a reason to think at least directionally that it should be bigger than the $500 million or plus this year? Jim Vena : I am not going to put a number on next year. Let\u2019s wait and see what we -- where we end up with and where we want to put the place mark for next year. But operationally and what I see in this company and what I have seen from my history is that we will continue to improve our efficiency. We will be able to draw more business on because we win in the marketplace with a better product. We look at it end-to-end. I am going to try to make Kenny\u2019s job easier moving forward. So I think it\u2019s a win-win for us moving ahead and that\u2019s about as close as I will get to giving you any numbers. Allison Landry : Okay. Fair enough. And as you go through the network rationalization process, have you seen any meaningful opportunities for line sales? Jim Vena : Stay tuned. We will just work through it as the business mix and what we look at. I think we have already got a pretty good plan of what we look at our network. But at this point nothing to announce. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you. Jim Vena : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time. Kenny, I wanted to ask you a long-term question about the Energy franchise, obviously, you have got coal and sand challenges right now. You have got a plus signup of petroleum products. I\u2019d like to understand kind of what kind of flows near-term are driving you positive and what do you think is the risk that that positive could shift negative as we get into 2020 and the pipeline complex gets closer to being built out up in the Bakken? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So longer term, again, we think the comps for the sand will improve. We will see what happens there. On the crude oil side, we feel very optimistic about that market and we -- I look at that as a couple to a few years type of opportunity and we are gearing up, and we have got the resources out there, and I think you have read where the government has increased the curtailment, so we are expecting more volume to come along. David Vernon : Is that predominantly Canadian origin stuff, or is that also some stuff coming out of the Bakken? Kenny Rocker : That is the Canadian origin that we are looking at into the Gulf. David Vernon : Okay. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the growth near-term? Kenny Rocker : Correct. David Vernon : Okay. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up in the Industrial Products sort of segment, the average RPU [ph] came in a little bit softer. Can you talk a little bit about what the mix dynamic is going on inside of that segment and what the outlook is there sort of over the next couple quarters? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So Rob talked about this a little bit earlier, and we really have got some strong double-digit growth on the construction products. Our rock shipments have a shorter length of haul. That\u2019s there. You could possibly make the -- as you look at a lot of the Petrochem business, it\u2019s also a lot that moves inside and interchange into the Gulf. So you have got a strong mix there of growth that is not as longer haul as say some of the other pieces of business like our lumber that\u2019s down. David Vernon : And will that -- will those sort of mix trends sort of continue for the foreseeable future or do you see any sort of major shifts ahead or it\u2019s just kind of this shift continuing? Kenny Rocker : We would expect both the Petrochem and the Construction Product business to continue to grow. I think the economy will help us out with the housing market right now, it\u2019s been pretty flat, and again, that\u2019s also truck susceptible. So a stronger economy will help us compete better in that housing market and we would hope for a little bit more help with the overall side there. David Vernon : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting my question in, and Rob, congrats as well. I am just going to ask one, but this may be a longer term question. When you guys look at the Intermodal business, if we comp you relative to industry growth, I think, Union Pacific has probably fallen behind there over the last decade, but obviously you guys have improved returns and margins in that time period. So I guess looking forward with the new operating plan, I mean, is Intermodal a now more attractive business than maybe it was in the past or you guys have been calling out for a couple of years here competitive pressures. I mean, is that more competition from north of the border that Jim might know very well or how do you think about it looking forward? Lance Fritz : Yeah. So let\u2019s talk about the Intermodal business broken into two pieces, international and domestic. They are both attractive. Our work on cost structure has made growth in both attractive to us presuming it\u2019s in the right price. And from a domestic Intermodal perspective, we have got a track record of growing domestic intermodal up until about the last call it 18 months and I think that has more to do with the flip on truck capacity than almost anything else. Once overcapacity happens in trucks, there\u2019s just a lot of behavior that breaks out the marketplace that makes it difficult to grow in an attractive return. Our current cost structure has changed the playing field for us in terms of what\u2019s an attractive piece of business and our current service product has changed the playing field so that customers look at us and think, boy, they are a viable alternative to my truck network. So both of those I think should be positives for us to get back on the path of growing domestic Intermodal. That still needs to also occur in the context of truck capacity getting right-sized. Internationally, there is no doubt that Southern California ports have lost some market share both to Canada and to a smaller degree the East Coast ports and that is troubling. And that I think has less to do, I know it has less to do with our service product from California ports to, let\u2019s say, places like Chicago and more to do with the overall cost and infrastructure of landing a box and paying fees at ports. So we are really trying to help the port of -- ports in California along the West Coast of the United States understand those dynamics and understand that it\u2019s a very competitive environment and the whole supply chain has to be involved in winning that business back to the West Coast ports. Net-net, our service product is being designed on an end-to-end game. So it\u2019s not just the transit over the road we are worried about, what dray looks like around our facilities in Chicago, what grounding looks like, how quickly we can turn our equipment with stripping and reloading, all that is moving in the right direction, and I think, all that is going to create opportunity in the future. We need to do that in partnership with our ports as well and we are. Brandon Oglenski : And well, I said, I was only going to ask one, but I guess, Lance, in that regard, I mean, have you guys changed your marketing efforts on the Intermodal side to address some of these challenges? Lance Fritz : For sure we are having those conversations. You have seen our product design change. We de-market it and got out of low density lanes. We have changed the layout of our Intermodal ramps in Chicago so that they are much more focused and dedicated. For instance, G4 in Joliet on international, G2 in Proviso on domestic, G-- the yard center on North-South on automotive parts and that\u2019s helping. So, yeah, I would say, we are addressing the marketplace in a different way to have a service product that wins. And it\u2019s a good looking service product right now. And right now it\u2019s basically up to the marketplace, and Kenny\u2019s team to make those matches happen and to get essentially the truck overcapacity back into the right box. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. We have turned on things like the Intermodal reservation terminal reservation so that our customers have really good visibility on which containers or which boxes they are going to move on what date. So it takes out any confusion or ambiguity there, which the customers love. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and yeah, congrats, Rob, Jennifer, on the new roles and the new retirement. Best of luck. I want to come back on your answer to the intermodal difference between you and BN. When I see a company that is implementing PSR the way Jim is doing it at Union Pacific, ripping out that level of workforce and locomotives and so on. I would expect some service disruption, and I would argue that these declines relative to your closest peer would be par for the course here. Is there any of that going on. I mean, that would suggest that the disruption and the decline is temporary and that when you are completed your PSR, you can use it as a weapon rather than a cost reduction tool. You can use it as a share gain weapon and just stay tuned for more rather than your commentary about a real competitive environment. I mean, that doesn\u2019t leave -- that\u2019s a much more negative, I think, if you are pointing at a more competitive or a competitor, I guess, is a little less encouraging than if it was just due to temporary disruption on service, any comments on that? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Walter, so let me put a little finer point on the answer that we gave a little while back. Specific to Intermodal, specific to rationalizing our lanes, that impact might be a couple of 3 percentage points. So you are right, there\u2019s a bit of that and I would expect us to grow back through that. But there is still a piece in that particular marketplace that is both truck overcapacity that has to get back in the box and it will. Those always ebb and flow over time in business cycles and I think those are the two big moving parts. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And then just following up on the pace, Jim, of PSR adoption, in the past we have always noted it to be very fast, very significant early on. This quarter compared to Q2 was effectively flattish, obviously, we were expecting a little bit better given you had a lot of flood impacts in the second quarter, hoping for a bit more of a improved third quarter relative to the second quarter. I don\u2019t want to answer it for you, but obviously prior PSR implementation generally has been done in a nice strong economy and growth environment. Is that the reason why we are seeing a bit more of a muted pace in the early execution or is there another reason? Jim Vena : Son of a gun, I am telling you, Walter. So 5,700 FTEs, 13% drop versus volume 8%, train length up 16%, dwell time dropped, freight velocity up, workforce productivity on a dropping business model better, so if that\u2019s average, son of a gun, I want average again next quarter, okay? That\u2019s the way I look at it. I think we have got to be smart about it. We don\u2019t want to blow up the place. I could have park a thousand locomotives the first day I showed up. I am not going to do that. I think it\u2019s a long game and I don\u2019t mean long by years, but it\u2019s a long game, do it right. Get the right product and this whole intermodal discussion, it\u2019s a great question, and this is where we want to be. We want to be where we have a very efficient railroad. We are able to open up new markets. We are able to beat the competition which is other railroads and truck and bring more product in without dropping our price. So that\u2019s the game we are playing. I am excited about it, Walter, and you are a tough, your kids must hate coming home with their score cards, you are a tough marker. Walter Spracklin : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Lance Fritz : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. Rob, I have to offer, one, my congratulations on your retirement. I think sitting in my chair for as long as I have I am definitely jealous of seeing somebody retire. Also, it\u2019s been a pleasure to work with you over the years. You have been extremely generous with your time and always gracious with your responses. Jennifer, welcome back. All I can say if you are going to work with us analysts again you must be a glutton for punishment. Two quick questions here, one, Jim, clearly there\u2019s been a lot of success here in PSR. But train speeds are the one thing that I would call out that I am a little bit surprised at. I knew there were some puts and takes, but relatively flat in a declining environment. Can you talk a little bit about that and what we should expect going forward and then I have one more follow-up. Jim Vena : Okay. So let\u2019s talk about train speed. People want to worry about train speed. I look at car velocity which is the end-to-end measure that the customer looks at. It\u2019s not just a subsection. So what we have done is we have taken some of our trains that used to run through and been able to not stop and get end-to-end, and we have added work events for them. We get them at 3,000 or 4,000 cars instead of running extra trains. So at this point, we are looking through that. What I see moving forward is, we will have the fastest train velocity of anybody in the railroad network that we compare ourselves to. So we are working towards that and I expect some noise some more. If I have a choice of increasing the train speed by a tenth of 1% and running the car velocity quicker and being able to drop the number of cars I need by 5,000, I will take the car drop and car velocity over the train speed. So that\u2019s where my mind is with it. Jason Seidl : Okay. Fair enough. And my last question, Rob, I am going to go for you for old time\u2019s sake. You talked a bit about rent expense dropping. You mentioned volume is one of the reasons it was off over 13% in the quarter. Given that volumes are going to be down on a similar fashion in 4Q, would you expect rent expense to be about down the same in 4Q as it was in 3Q? Rob Knight : Yeah. Without a fine point on it, I can\u2019t see any reason why directionally it wouldn\u2019t look similar to the third quarter. Jason Seidl : Okay. I appreciate the time as always. Lance Fritz : All right. Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Fadi Chamoun : Yes. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. Congratulations, Rob and Jennifer, on the announcements. One question for Jim, I mean, the operating ratio will have a pace that is also influenced by some of the topline dynamic we are seeing. But if I think in terms of actual progress on redesigning the operating plan and rationalizing the classification assets and all the kind of Unified Plan 2020 you are doing. Does less volume help you get more things done, and hopefully, as we come out of this volume downturn we can see a stronger payback than we would have otherwise? Jim Vena : No. Fadi, in fact, it\u2019s the other way the way I see it. I would love to have increase in volume come on. Volume helps us in that we are able to really run the place more efficiently and more -- as cars come on on the same trains that we are operating on. So I see volume as a helper. It helps us both topline and bottomline. But on top of that efficiency wise it helps us even better. So that\u2019s exactly what we want, Fadi. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up. Thanks for that, Jim. If we do see next year another challenging volume environment down mid-single digits, is there any constraint or any roadblock that would prevent you from taking another 10% plus out of the headcount? Jim Vena : I hate to be negative but the answer is no. We will react on what the market gives us. What the competition gives us and what is available for the economy. So we will react in the right way up or down and I am hoping that it\u2019s up and everything that we see is with the floods and everything we have we see a good year starting next year. So that\u2019s where we are, Fadi. Lance Fritz : We are looking forward to volume presuming the economy stays healthy. I would love to see a little bit of growth. That would be welcome. But whatever the economy is, Rob says this, it\u2019s probably a fitting ending to the call. Rob says that every time we get together and that is the economy is what the economy is. We deal with the hand that we are dealt and we don\u2019t use that as an excuse and we won\u2019t. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Fadi. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. In closing, we have made really good progress in the third quarter delivering a more consistent reliable service product with a fundamentally smaller cost structure. And although, I\u2019d much prefer a growth environment, our operating performance gives us a lot of confidence that as volume returns to the network, we are going to leverage it very efficiently and return even stronger results. With that, I look forward to talking with you again in January to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer.  This morning Union Pacific is reporting 2019 fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.02 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $2.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 59.7%, a 1.9 percentage point improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. . : Before we go any further, I want to recognize all of our employees for their remarkable service and productivity achievements in 2019. The women and men of Union Pacific are transforming our railroads.  Step change increases in car velocity and trip plan compliance while using one-third fewer cars and locomotives takes ingenuity, initiative and teamwork and the team, through the implementation of Unified Plan 2020 is changing our network in fundamental ways to be safer, more reliable, and more efficient.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance and good morning. For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 11% primarily due to declines in Premium and the Energy business group. The decrease in volume partially offset by a 1% improvement and average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 10% in the quarter.  Let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance for each of the business groups. Starting off with Ag products, revenue for the quarter was down 2% on a 2% decrease in volumes and flat in an average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 1%, as fewer domestic shipments were partially offset by modest gains in exports. Volume for grain products was up 2% driven by an increase in ethanol from the Midwest to East Coast markets. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 13% primarily due to weakness in export potash. Moving on to Energy, revenue was down 25% as volume declined 20%, coupled with a 6% decrease in average revenue per car related to negative mix with the loss of long-haul sand volume. Sand carloads were down 53%, due to the impact of local sand as well as a slowdown in market activity.  Coal and coke volume was down 25%, due to a weaker market conditions resulting from lower natural gas prices and soft export demand. In addition, contract changes also impacted volume in the quarter. However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 19% increase in petroleum, LPG, and renewable carloads for the quarter and we expect to see this positive trend for crude oil to continue in 2020.  Industrial revenue volume and average revenue per car were flat for the quarter. Both construction and plastic shipments have been strong in all of 2019 and continued to be favorable in the fourth quarter as well.  Construction carloads increased 5%, primarily driven by strong market demand in the south for rock shipments. Plastics volume increased 2% due to plant expansion but tempered due to soft domestic demand. Forest product volume decreased 8% driven by softness in the lumber and paper markets. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 14% on a 15% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car improved by 1%. Domestic intermodal volume declined 8%, primarily driven by an abundant truck supply, coupled with softer demand during peak seasons. International intermodal volume was down 23% during the quarter, reflecting weak market conditions related to trade uncertainty, and a challenging year-over-year fourth quarter comp driven by accelerated shipments in 2018 seeking to avoid tariffs. And finally, finished vehicle shipments were down 13% for the quarter reflecting weak year-over-year auto sales, coupled with the GM labor strike. Fourth quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 1% from 2018. Strong light truck and SUV sales did not fully offset declining car demand. Going forward, we will begin to report on our three business groups, Bulk, Industrial and Premium. For 2020, in our Bulk segment, we expect coal to experience continued challenges with volume in the New Year and weather conditions will always be a factor for coal demand.  However, on a positive note, we anticipate continued strength in advanced biofuel shipments and associated feedstock due to an increase in demand. We also expect stronger beer shipments along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business.  In addition, with the recent signing of the Phase I trade deal with China, we expect to see those Ag exports resume in the latter half of the year. For Industrial, local sand supply will continue to further impact volume. However, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments driven largely by a plant expansion coming online this year as well as continued strength in the construction market in the south.  Additionally, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products.  And lastly, for Premium, the U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is 16.7 million units, down between 2% to 3% from 2019. Consumer preference for SUVs over Sedans will continue to partially offset the decline in car demand. Domestic intermodal volume is sequentially strengthening, however, will continue to be impacted by truck competition in the first half of 2020. From where we sit today, we expect a more balanced supply demand in the truck market by mid-2020, which supports intermodal competitiveness during the second half of the year.  We expect international intermodal to return to a nominal seasonal slow but faces tough year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter due to the accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff increases in early 2019.  As we began 2020, I feel really good about where we are headed. Our service product has improved significantly and the table is set for us to grow and win business with our customers. I am excited to see the benefits of an improved supply chain continue for our customers.  And with that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jim for an update on our operating performance. Jim Vena : Thanks, Kenny. As you\u2019ve already heard this morning, we continue to deliver strong results which I think speaks volumes for what is possible. Our operating metrics continue to improve and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers. The team once again responded to the challenge of rightsizing our cost structure in the face of declining volumes while also driving significant productivity and I couldn\u2019t be more proud.  For example, crew starts were down 20% in the quarter and outpaced the 11% decline in carloads we experienced. This, along with our Unified Plan 2020 actions drove an operating ratio of 59.7%, which was outstanding. While we will continue to drive productivity, it cannot come at the cost of safety. As always, safety remains our number one priority at Union Pacific. Turning to slide 11, I\u2019d now like to update you on our six key performance indicators. We continue to see significant year-over-year improvement in our metrics. This is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020. Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 5% improvement in freight car velocity and a 13% improvement in freight car terminal dwell compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Train speed for the fourth quarter increased 1% to 26.2 miles per hour, compared to 2018. Now turning to slide 12, continuing our trends from the third quarter, locomotive productivity improved to 14% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of December 31st, we had around 3,100 locomotives stored, which excludes 300 units that were either sold or retired. Driven by a 17% decrease in our force levels, workforce productivity increased 4% year-over-year despite the volume decrease. Car trip compliance improved 9 points year-over-year driven by increased freight car velocity and lower dwell demonstrating our team\u2019s commitment to delivering a consistent and reliable service product for our customers. We are pleased with our progress in 2019 and we expect to see continued improvement in our service product going forward. Slide 13 highlights some of the recent network changes we have made as part of the Unified Plan 2020. We recently stopped humping cars at Davidson Yard in Fort Worth. We also reduced switching at our Settegast Yard in the Houston area and shifted the work to nearby Englewood Yard. On the third quarter earnings call, we talked about a change in Kansas City to stop humping cars at the Neff Yard. Building on that change we recently curtailed operations at Armourdale yard and moved the work to a single location at our 18th Street Yard for the entire Kansas City complex. In addition, we continue to adjust our local operations to align with customer demand while remaining focused on delivering the quality service product. Going forward, we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches leading to additional terminal rationalization opportunities on our network.  Increasing train size remains one of our main areas of focus to utilize our existing network capacity and we are making excellent progress by putting more products on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by 16% or over 1100 feet since the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 8200 feet in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Looking forward, I expect to see continued improvement in train length through a combination of transportation plan changes and targeted capital investments that I will talk about more on the next slide.  In 2019, we invested approximately $3.2 billion in railroad infrastructure pending final approval by our Board of Directors for 2020, we are targeting base capital spending of $2.95 billion with an additional $150 million for strategic siding extensions. About 80% of our planned 2020 capital investment is replacing spending to \u2013 is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network.  We will purchase no new locomotives in 2020, although we will continue to modernize our existing fleet. Targeted freight car acquisitions will support both replacements and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in capacity projects on our network to improve productivity and operational efficiency including investments to support the consolidation of intermodal operations in Chicago.  We also plan strategic siding extensions to increase train length capability in targeted locations. These sidings will support our efficiency initiatives by increasing the number of long trains we can operate in each direction thus reducing demand for crew starts.  Positive train control spending will focus on interoperability testing in an enhancement to our energy management system to reduce fuel consumption. To wrap up, we have made a number of changes to our operation in the last year and the results have been tremendous.  However, there are still a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. As we move forward, look for us to continue pushing the envelope as we transform our operations. Running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for all of our stakeholders is job one and our team is committed to making that happen.  And with that, I will turn it over to Jennifer. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Today we are reporting fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.02 and 1.9 points of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio to 59.7%. This is an all-time best fourth quarter operating ratio for Union Pacific and our third consecutive quarter starting with a 59%. As shown on Slide 17, we received a partial insurance recovery of $40 million associated with the flooding experienced in the first half of 2019. $25 million of the $40 million reduced fourth quarter operating expense adding $0.03 of EPS to the quarter as well as helping the operating ratio by half a point.  Lower year-over-year fuel prices favorably impacted the quarterly operating ratio by 0.2 points, although our fuel surcharge lag actually had a $0.01 negative EPS impact compared to 2018.  The good news is that in the face of significant volume headwinds, we drove core margin improvement of 1.2 points in the quarter. These results are a proof statement that true our company initiatives to improve productivity, the UP team is having great success running a more efficient reliable network. Looking now at our fourth quarter income statement, operating revenue totaled $5.2 billion, down 9% versus last year on an 11% volume decrease. Operating expense decreased 12% to $3.1 billion as we demonstrated our ability to be more than volume variable with our cost structure. These results net to operating income of $2.1 billion, a 5% decrease versus 2018.  Below the line, other income increased 22% driven by reduced environmental and benefit plan costs partially offset by lower real estate sale gains. Quarterly income tax expense increased 3% on a higher effective tax rate. For full year 2020, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Although net income of $1.4 billion was down 10% versus last year, our fourth quarter earnings per share only decreased 5% to $2.02 per share as our continued share repurchase activity offset roughly half of the income impact.  Slide 19 provides a breakdown of our fourth quarter freight revenue which totaled $4.9 billion, a 10% decrease versus 2018 driven primarily by the 11% volume decline. Additionally, fuel surcharge revenue had a 1% negative impact to revenue, down $125 million to $363 million.  Although not able to offset the impact of volumes in fuel, the combination of our ongoing pricing actions and business mix had a 2.5 point positive impact on our quarterly freight revenue. Consistent with our guidance, throughout 2019, total dollars generated from our pricing actions for the year well exceeded our rail inflation costs.  As Kenny mentioned, we will begin reporting under our new business team structure at our first quarter call, in mid-February, we will provide a mapping of our carload volumes to the new business groups and make available pro forma volume and revenue for prior years. At the same time, we also will start providing weekly revenue ton miles across key market segments beyond the three new business teams.  Slides 20 and 21 provides a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. Starting with compensation and benefits expense, this category decreased 18% to $1 billion driven by a 17% workforce reduction or about 7100 FTEs versus 2018. Our productivity initiatives, coupled with lower volumes resulted in a 20% decrease in our train and engine workforce, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 16%.  Fuel expense fell 20% to $512 million as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed through more efficient operations and through a combination of reduced purchased transportation, lower mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, our purchased services and materials expense declined 9% to $531 million.  Turning to Slide 21, depreciation expense of $559 million increased 1% compared to 2018. Equipment and other rents of $230 million decreased 14% driven primarily by lower equipment lease expense and less volume-related costs.  Other expense increased 5%, to $231 million, as a result of increased casualty cost and higher state and local taxes partially offset by the insurance recovery I previously mentioned. For full year 2020, we expect year-over-year depreciation expense to increase about 2% and other expense to be up roughly 5%.  Looking now at productivity, net productivity savings yielded from our G55 + 0 initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately $215 million in the fourth quarter. These results bring our full year 2019 net productivity to $590 million which significantly exceeded our guidance of at least $500 million and marks an all-time high annual productivity savings for Union Pacific.  This really is a remarkable accomplishment for the UP team considering the backdrop we achieved this against unprecedented flooding and a weakening environment.  Stepping back to look at full year 2019, we reported earnings per share of $8.38 a share, a 6% increase versus 2018 despite facing volume and revenue declines of 6% and 5% respectively. Importantly, as a result of the strong productivity gains I just discussed, we held operating income flat year-over-year at $8.6 billion.  As you know, over the course of 2019, we had a number of different items that impacted our operating ratio and earnings, but when you set all that aside, the important measure for us is improvement in our core performance, which was nearly 2 points better versus last year as we met our guidance of a sub 61% operating ratio for 2019.  And we can\u2019t talk about a full year operating ratio of 60.6% without acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our workforce. These results could not have been achieved without them. So hats off to the teams. Turning now to cash and returns, 2019 was another year of both strong cash generation and cash returns to our shareholders as free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $5.2 billion resulting in a cash flow conversion rate equal to 87% of our net income.  Beyond continuing our strong program of capital investments, we rewarded shareholders with two 10% dividend increases in the first and third quarters bringing our dividend payout ratio to just over 44% as we distributed $2.6 billion. We also repurchased 35 million shares of our common stock at an all-in cost of $5.8 billion reducing our full year average share balance by 6% versus 2018.  In combination, the dividends and share repurchases added up to a total of $8.4 billion of cash return to our shareholders. In addition to the cash generating power of our business, we funded part of this cash return to the strength of UP\u2019s balance sheet. We ended 2019 with an all-in adjusted debt balance of $27.4 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2018. Our solid investment-grade credit rating and a very attractive rate market allowed us to issue $4 billion of new debt during 2019, partially offset by the repayment of debt maturities. With that, we finished the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times as we are continuing to increase our leverage position to the previously guided target of 2.7 times, while maintaining minimum credit ratings of BBB Plus and BAA1.  Finally, our return on invested capital came in at 15% basically flat with 2018 as we stay disciplined with our capital spend in a challenging volume environment.  Let me close out today with our view of the year ahead. As we look to 2020, we expect to see volumes inflect the positive side of the ledger on a full year basis growing 1% or so overall. This view takes into account expected declines in coal and sand volumes, as well as the tough year-over-year intermodal comparisons that Kenny mentioned.  Against this volume expectation, we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy where the dollars gain exceed our 2020 rail inflation cost. This expectation is fully supported by the great service products we are providing to our customers and is integral to achieving our 2020 and long-term return objectives.  With regard to inflation, we expect overall inflation in 2020 to be around 2% with labor inflation closer to 2.5%. We also expect our workforce to be down around 8% or so on a full year basis. Coming off of a record productivity performance in 2019, we expect to yield at least another $500 million of productivity savings in 2020 as Jim and team continue to identify and pursue efficiency savings.  Together, we believe these activities should result in another strong step down in our operating ratio and while we don\u2019t anticipate a fuel tailwind like we experienced in 2019, we are confident in our ability to achieve a sub-60 operating ratio. In fact, we believe, we should close out 2020 with a full year number that looks more like a 59.  As it relates to our capital allocation, our high-level guidance for capital spending, capital structure and use of free cash flow remains unchanged. The first call on cash is our capital investment, which we still expect to be less than 15% of revenue over the long-term and $3.1 billion for 2020.  After capital expenditures, we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, maintaining our targeted payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and we should complete our previously announced three year plan to repurchase approximately $20 billion of shares by the end of 2020. That plan is now 70% complete leaving about $6 billion to repurchase this year.  In summary, we expect positive full year volume, solid core pricing and significant productivity gains will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation and margin improvements. We are taking another positive step forward with our operating ratio in 2020 on the path to our longer-term target of a 55% operating ratio. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As discussed today, we leveraged strong productivity to deliver solid fourth quarter and full year financial results. Unified Plan 2020 continues to serve as a catalyst for improved productivity and a better service product.  Looking ahead to 2020, we are committed to operating a safe railroad and providing highly consistent, reliable and efficient service for our customers while focusing on opportunities to grow the business and improve margins. Our strong operating performance in 2019 gives us confidence that as we attract business to our network, we\u2019ll leverage it very efficiently generating strong free cash flow and improve financial results.  This is going to position us to continue investing in our network and returning excess cash to our shareholders. So with that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Morning guys. Lance Fritz : Good morning. Kenny Rocker : Good morning. Scott Group : So, I wanted to start on the 8% headcount reduction for the year. Just so I understand, is that an average for the full year? Or is that a beginning to end of year number, just because, if it\u2019s an average, it doesn\u2019t seem to really imply any additional headcount reductions from here. So I just want to \u2013 is that the right way to think about where we are from a headcount standpoint? Jennifer Hamann : Hi, Scott. This is Jennifer. Yes, that 8% is a full year average and it does imply some further reductions from here. I think if you just roll forward where we are at into 2020, it would be around 6% or so. So, we are looking for further gains and obviously, volumes will depend on that and we are going to continue to try to improve our efficiency overall, but that\u2019s our view today. Scott Group : Okay. Okay. And then, on the volume outlook, so, slightly positive. Obviously, we are starting in a [depot] [ph] net gas is below 2, right. Maybe could you just share sort of what you are assuming for coal volumes this year?  And what are maybe the biggest tailwinds that you see in terms of the things out there, Kenny? And then, just as we think about the OR guidance and the volume outlook, volume guidance together, what\u2019s the sensitivity to operating ratio if you think the volumes ultimately stay negative? Lance Fritz : Kenny, why don\u2019t you take the volume question and I\u2019ll circle back on the OR question? Kenny Rocker : So, first of all, each of our customers have a unique decision tree that they are using when they are trying to figure out whether or not they are going to dispatch coal or they are going to go to natural gas.  I can tell you that our commercial and operating team have been really dogged in sitting down with our customers and looking at ways to improve efficiencies in the supply chain whether that\u2019s train length, whether that\u2019s cycle times, whether it\u2019s things like forecasting by days, we are doing everything we can to make sure that that supply chain is competitive.  When you step back and look broadly at the volume outlook, you look at the petrochem industry and the plastics that we will expect to continue to grow there some other things along with that that are not as large in volume like the feedstocks that will help us out. We also expect continued growth in terms of the petro side of things.  So, the crude oil business and then also if the weather is favorable, the rock shipments in the south, there is still a lot of upside there and a lot of growth in the south. Now, those are just the markets and you also think about the second half of the year. There is still some positives that I am expecting will happen on the trade side and that will not just impact positively on the Ag side during the, call it the September time range, but also our international intermodal side. So those are things that from a market perspective we expect to happen. Having said all those things, our commercial team has a very aggressive mindset to say regardless of whatever the market happens we need to go out there and win because we have a better service product. So we are going out there. We are creating intermodal products.  We\u2019ve got a \u2013 this is all public information. We have a product for our international intermodal business that\u2019s with Northern Iowa Railroad and Valor Victoria. On the Bulk side, we are going out and securing more business based on the new service product that we have for our grain products moving west. So, you heard about the markets and it\u2019s also good to hear about the mindset of our commercial teams. Lance Fritz : And, Scott, regarding your question on the volume to top side and the impact on OR, the way we\u2019ve wired up the plan right now and what we\u2019ve shared with everybody this morning, we do expect to see some volume growth.  Now, take that exactly as intended which is, it can be very small, but we do expect it to be a plus sign, not a minus sign. And as you point out, the first part of the year is challenged. It\u2019s still got headwinds against tough comps on international intermodal and of course a loose truck market and natural gas pricing against coal.  But when you take it all into account, you take some of the impacts that we expect to see from the recent trade deals and tightening of the truck market we anticipate the second half looks better. All put together, that wires up for us to something like a 59 operating ratio and that\u2019s what we are pursuing right now. Of course, there is a lot of moving parts and it\u2019s early in the year. So, we\u2019ll just continue to manage as we see the markets evolve. Scott Group : All right. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. If I can just follow-up on the last question, just what level of truck market tightening are you really envisioning? Is it just a more of a return to a normal market? Or is it something like a 2018 like, almost ELD like scenario given the kind of [five] [ph] supply side catalysts we have in place? Kenny Rocker : Yes, we are seeing some tightening occur now and what I call it is, we do feel like we are at the floor. Again, it\u2019s some of the things play out with trade we are expecting by mid-2020 to tighten more \u2013 for me to put a hand on whether or not it\u2019s going to get back to normal level, that\u2019s hard to say.  But we do in talking to all of our customers and seeing some of the bankruptcies that have taken place in the market, we expect for it to certainly be a better truck environment for us to compete in.  Finally, just as we think about the truck market, I just want to emphasize on our premium - our intermodal network, our service product has improved better. Customers are seeing less dwell for their commodities. We\u2019ve talked about the reduced complexities in Chicago. And so, all of those things really create a lower cost structure that gives us a lot of confidence that we can compete in the marketplace. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just a follow-up, now that you are kind of comfortably into the PSR process and you are like sub-60 or at this point [indiscernible] 2020. What\u2019s your line of sight to G55 and kind of when you guys get there and kind of what level of incremental heavy lifting do you need to get there?  I mean, is that mostly a top-line driven walk from this point on or do you think there is still big cost components that will get you another 400, 500 basis points more? Jennifer Hamann : So, Ravi, this is Jennifer. You\u2019ve heard us talk about the long-term target and I think you\u2019ve also heard us say, and remember that when we first put that out there, we were not in the phases of adopting Unified Plan 2020. And so, now that we are in that we are even more confident in our ability to get there. But we have also talked about it in terms of kind of the three levers in terms of volume, price and productivity and certainly what helps us to this point has been the price and productivity.  We\u2019ve not had as much on the volume side. And so, with the great service product that the operating teams put together, we feel very confident about our ability to start bringing that volume on and we will leverage that very efficiently. But we still have obviously great productivity opportunities ahead as well. We said that we are looking to get about another $500 million here in 2020. That\u2019s off of $590 million in 2019. So, those are big numbers and we feel very good about that. So, we\u2019ll continue to press on all fronts as we move forward. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, Jennifer. Just I wanted to follow-up very quickly if I could on the headcount question, because I actually didn\u2019t follow the math on that. If you just take the average levels in the fourth quarter and extrapolate that, it would translate \u2013 that itself would translate to 8% decline in average headcount.  So, I could be calculating something wrong. But if you can just offer a little bit more clarification there just given how important that is to the overall productivity of the company? Jennifer Hamann : So, thank you. Yes, I mean, the headcount reductions are very important for us overall. We\u2019ll continue to push that. The math is, assuming some volume improvement and that we want to leverage that very effectively. So, we are going to continue to push that forward and again, we are saying 8% plus minus is what we are looking for in a full year basis. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. And just as a follow-up, again, I guess, this question is for Jennifer. And that\u2019s really \u2013 how do we interpret, just conceptually at least $500 million of net productivity? And the way I\u2019ve just always thought about it is that, it\u2019s kind of like the uplift in profits that you expect in a neutral revenue environment and I just want to ask, is that a fair way to think about it?  And also, just the guidance that you are giving for 59 OR assume some drag from mix, because if you get the $500 million plus, and you overlay some revenue growth on it, I would have just assumed the OR improvement would have been better than a 59 OR. So if you can just help us think about conceptually the $500 million relative and kind of layering on the revenue growth on top of that? Jennifer Hamann : Sure. So, when we think about productivity and talk to you about, that does exclude volume. So, when we talk about being able to turn around and move to the positive side of the ledger, from a volume standpoint, that\u2019s where you start talking about incremental margins which we think could look very favorable for us.  We think we\u2019ve got a great plan put together for 2020 and feel very good about the guidance that we are giving, 59 OR. Making another very solid step forward in 2020 and we are looking to do that with not much volume and off of a 6% down year this year.  So, I think it\u2019s a good move for us and next solid step down and we\u2019ll continue to press the envelope. But we want to do it safely, reliably, continue providing the really good service product and keep moving forward. But we are not trying to meter our progress either. We are going to try to go as fast as we can. Amit Mehrotra : Jim, I know you love this question. What inning are you in the PSR process? Jim Vena : Well, baseball finished. So, let\u2019s talk football, it\u2019s right in the middle of the real exciting part. Amit Mehrotra : What yard line are you on? Jim Vena : Well, I started on the 20 yard line, or 25 yard line and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve hit the middle of the field yet. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That\u2019s enough for me. Thank you very much. Jim Vena : Thank you. You are welcome. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, maybe more specific one on efficiency for you. How do you think about fuel as you look at the network here? You get longer trains, a younger locomotive fleet, better horsepower management, but you haven\u2019t really seen the improvements from the field as some of the other peers have done, I think Canada or even CSX. So, what level of confidence you think you have in that improving and how big of a event mover do you count on that in the next couple of years? Jim Vena : I think, fuel is an area where we can get better. We are investing this year with more locomotives that will make it even easier for us. That\u2019s be able to get some fuel conservation. So we did a lot of work in 2019 and we see the same sort of trend line going. Every railroad is different in their topography, but we feel that there is still money left on the table that we can save and be more fuel efficient. Bigger trains, more cars on less trains is probably the biggest way for us to get the more fuel conservation. And I\u2019d be guessing on the final number. We are shooting for an improvement from last year and we\u2019ll continue to have that. Brian Ossenbeck : But the pace of improvement \u2013 excuse me - start accelerate here, so I think you are doing about 1% or 2% last couple of quarters, but train lengths are up as you mentioned about 16% year-over-year. So is this a lagging indicator or something that needs to have a few more things fall into place before you can get the material benefit on that? Jim Vena : I wouldn\u2019t change the trend line that what we\u2019ve done in 2019 as an improvement in the trend line in that low 1%, 1.5% sort of gain that we should be able to be more efficient on fuel. So, at this point, that\u2019s what I see for numbers. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks, Jim. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Brian Ossenbeck : And again one on exports. Kenny, can you just clarify what you mean on the trade deal in terms of what type of benefit you expect on the Ag side? And then how you think about the export corn, which is down about half when you look at the current marketing year here in the U.S.? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes, so, there is \u2013 the larger piece of the pie is really on the soybean side and that\u2019s really more of a \u2013 probably more, I call it more about a fourth quarter type look for us. Brazil comes in during the first part of the year.  But then there are some other parts of the grain that we could see a slow uptick and as you mentioned, corn would be one of them, milo could be one of them, wheat would be one of them. I think it\u2019s too soon to tell the timing of it. We\u2019ve been talking to our customers and a lot of traders are talking and I\u2019d expect more clarity as we move throughout the year over the next few months. But what you need to hear is that, get into space one trade deal we see it as a positive. Lance Fritz : Yes, Brian, this is Lance. So, the Phase 1 trade deal essentially takes China as a headwind and sets it up to be a potential tailwind. Very high level, they are committing to over doubling their purchases of U.S. goods with a concentration in Ag in some other areas.  That if it comes true, or if even a large portion or even a half of it comes true, it\u2019s a really nice tailwind for us going into the next couple of three years. So that there is \u2013 it just basically turns a headwind into a tailwind. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks, Lance and Kenny. I appreciate. Kenny Rocker : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Thanks, good morning. Could you just maybe speak to the rate of OR improvement throughout the year? And should we expect it to accelerate meaningfully once volumes do inflect positive since you are not currently getting all the full benefits of PSR? I guess, in other words, should second half margins be a lot better than the first half? Jennifer Hamann : So, Allison, as you know, our margins tend to be follow some of the seasonality. We tend to have some of our weakest \u2013 or I guess, highest ORs in first quarter, improve through the year. Third quarter tends to be our best margins then they go down a bit.  Some of that has to do with weather. Some of that has to do with the volumes that we are moving. So, we don\u2019t see anything at this point that would fundamentally change that pattern. We are not going to guide to quarterly numbers. But that\u2019s how you could think of it. Allison Landry : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just another question on the productivity. I guess, first, does that include the lapping of weather and inefficiency costs that you saw in the first part of 2019? And then, Jennifer, I think you said that it does not include incremental on volume.  Is that right, because I think if I do the math and back out productivity, it seems to imply low teens incremental on sort of what I\u2019d call organic growth and normally you do much higher than that? So, if you could help us and walk through that. Thank you Jennifer Hamann : So, to the last part of the question about productivity, I think we said that that excludes volumes and so if you put volume on top of that, that helps us drive much better incremental as we move through the year. So, I think that, what was the first part of your question again there? Allison Landry : Does the $500 million include lapping of the weather and inefficiency costs from the first half of 2019? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, yes. Allison Landry : Okay. Lance Fritz : It starts from scratch. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, it starts from scratch. Right, right. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning. And Jim, nice job on the continued improvements or team, I guess. But, maybe just thinking, I am still a little confused by some of the answers upfront, if volumes are up and you are getting pricing \u2013 core pricing gains, it seems like you are targeting up flat employee absolute number, given the 8% decline, which would make \u2013 I guess, if you are looking for volumes to increase, maybe that\u2019s the flow through.  And then, given the productivity savings, the math would seem to suggest the larger operating ratio improvement. Is there may be a larger mix negative impact that we are looking at than \u2013 and maybe kind of you can dig into the coal impact. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s more export \u2013 loss of export tonnage or contract losses or anything on the domestic side? Lance Fritz : Hey Ken, this is Lance. And I\u2019ll start by just making sure we lay a crystal clear expectation of ourselves in 2020. And that is, we expect as part of the $500 million in productivity to have both carryover productivity, which is some of the headcount question that you are asking about, as well as incremental productivity.  If our volume is flat this year, we are going to have incremental employee productivity. If our volume grows, we will not add back resources at the same pace that we will grow. Now we are expecting growth to be pretty minor, I think is probably the right word and it\u2019s largely second half.  So, we are building kind of a cautious plan that gives us flexibility depending on what actually occurs as the year progresses. So I just want to be crystal clear about that. There is \u2013 we are sharing with you what we are comfortable sharing at this point. But the expectation is, continued productivity, some carryover, more realize through action and we\u2019ve got plenty of actions up against that. Jennifer Hamann : Right, and just building off that, I mean, our headcount of 8% plus, minus really is somewhat dependent on what happens with volumes, but again, we feel confident in our ability to drive the productivity and I think you\u2019ve seen us do that this year as the volumes have fallen off. We have been very aggressive in terms of the actions that we\u2019ve taken.  And so, again, to Lance\u2019s point, we feel good about the plan. But there is, we are sitting here on January 23rd. There is a lot of the year left in front of us and we\u2019ll take the actions that we need to take. But we are bullish about the opportunities, particularly as we look to see some volume return to us in the back half of 2020. Kenny Rocker : Hey, I think I\u2019ll add. I think you were asking about export coal. And we said this publicly before, it\u2019s a smaller percentage of our coal book is less than 10%, but yes, it has been impacting our export. Coal has been impacted. We will wait to see what happens with both the weather and natural gas. Natural gas plays a much larger role in how our customers are going to start on what they want to do with coal. Ken Hoexter : Kenny, if I could just get my follow-up with you then, if the international intermodal was down 23% significantly more than the West Coast markets noted, is that share a shift loss of contracts? Is there anything you want to highlight, I guess, as we look to balance that out? Kenny Rocker : We actually had tougher comps. I mean, if you think, if you go back to the 2018 fourth quarter, we had a really strong quarter. And so, now what you are seeing is just the comp and we should lap that here in the first quarter of this year. I mean, yes, the first quarter of this year. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. Wanted to \u2013 I guess a question for Jim. When I think about the \u2013 you had a tremendous pace of cost takeout or network improvement, how would you think about the duration of the big cost saves in network improvement? Is this a three year program that you\u2019ll still have a lot left to do in 2021?  Or is it\u2019s something where you really capture \u2013 you get from the 25 yard line to the \u2013 into the end zone in 2020. So just wanted if you could offer some thoughts on that and then also perhaps what the really big buckets are that are left for network productivity? Jim Vena : Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. So, if we think about \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this for way too long. So, you\u2019d never ever stop looking to productivity gains. You always look for what you can do to make the place better. So, the team delivered a great 2019. I would like to give everybody at Union Pacific a lot of credit with what we\u2019re able to deliver. But that\u2019s behind us. So, moving forward, we have projects that are short-term. So we have projects across the entire company that will help us to be able to deliver more productivity. Specifically, we have also some projects that will a while. We announced over a $100 million being spent on sidings. We don\u2019t expect to get them in the early part of the year.  That will be later and into next year. So the productivity gains are of this year. We see we have to deliver on that $500 million that we\u2019ve guided to and that means across the board and we see some more coming in the following years.  Never ever in my career have I've gone out somewhere and not found a way to make it a little bit better and improve. So I don\u2019t see that ending this year, but there is a big bucket this year and then it will get a little tougher as the time goes on. Tom Wadewitz : Are there particular areas that stand out if it\u2019s train lengths with some of the further siding investments is the big lever or a lot less than \u2013 I guess, terminal productivity and some of the changes with the hump yards? Or what would stand out as being the greatest remaining opportunity? Jim Vena : Train length is real important. Absolutely, train length is one that we have to deliver on. We think that we can make the terminals even more efficient. So we turn the cars quicker that helps the whole fleet. We\u2019ve got plans to put the intermodal terminals together in Chicago from six down to three. That helps us in the efficiency.  So, the way we handle our locomotives, I think we are not going to get rid of another 2,000 locomotives. We\u2019d only run an output just over 3,000 locomotives now, but we think there is gains there. There is gains on how we repair cars. There is repair on \u2013 there is money on gains on how we move our people around the network. The balancing of the network. There is a long list I could go through and spend an hour taking you through it. But I am very excited with what we have on the table for this year. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. So, just one last short follow-up. I think a number of the questions on the call are focused on the elements of your guidance. At the end of the day, it does feel like the guidance is somewhat conservative in terms of what you can do on the cost side and putting together some of the pieces, do you think it\u2019s fair for us to take away from the framework that there is an element of conservatism in the guide? Lance Fritz : Well, I\u2019ll start and say, Tom, that it\u2019s very early, specifically our confidence in the guidance we gave at the first part of the years and we build our plan appropriately. And then what you\u2019ve seen from us over years is we react as the year is progressing, as things change and universally, we know how to get productivity and we are demonstrating we know how to generate an excellent service product.  One of the things we\u2019ve got to demonstrate this year is growing with that service product. Part of Kenny and the commercial team, they are going to have to learn what the network is capable of and how to sell those products and get customers signed upfront. Jennifer Hamann : And I would just say, to add on to what Lance said, there is a 59 OR for us would be a new record level for us. It\u2019s an area that we\u2019ve not gotten to and so, we are going to continue to push the envelope and go as far as we can. But we felt good about the performance that we had this year.  But you know, we got there a lot differently than the way we thought we could when you think about the fact that we came into the year thinking we were going to have a couple points of volume growth that ended up down 6%. We certainly didn\u2019t anticipate the weather events that we encountered. So, to Lance\u2019s point, we are going to be very diligent about working hard to pull all the levers that we can and be aggressive to make improvements. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes, hi. Good morning. Just two questions. Just back on the Ag real quickly, can you talk a little bit about how much the export Ag business is to your total Ag franchise? And then, maybe just to give some sense, what was the adverse impact from exports in 2019? Lance Fritz : Yes, I tell you that, if you look at our grain business, it\u2019s a significant piece. I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s been where from a third to call it 40%. What was the second part of your question? Jordan Alliger : Really just, how much was that business let\u2019s say, down given the tariff issues in 2019? Lance Fritz : I\u2019d call it easily over half. I call it easily over half. Jim Vena : Yes, and those impacts, Jordan, that\u2019s on basically, China getting out of purchasing U.S. soybeans and going down to Brazil. DDGs which have been on again, off again were off for a fair period of time and it impacted even a little bit of corn, a little bit of wheat. So, the impact on export grain and grain products was pretty broad. Jordan Alliger : By half. Kenny Rocker : And the only thing I would add, Jordan, is that, really we would see it also open up the imports on the international intermodal side. I mean, that has a pretty sizable improvement of volume growth there too. So just keep that in mind too. Jordan Alliger : So, by half, you sort of mean half of the total decline in agriculture or I am just \u2013 didn\u2019t know what half meant? Kenny Rocker : There is a lot of upside here for us going forward on the Ag side and we are going to do everything we do to take advantage of it. Jordan Alliger : Okay. And then just one other question. Just on the \u2013 thinking about the volumes in 2020, how much of the \u2013 call it 1% volume outlook give or take is tied to intermodal recovery, whether it be domestic or international? Just trying to get a sense for how big a part of the volume story is related to your views on intermodal? Lance Fritz : Yes, Jordan, this is Lance. I don\u2019t think we put a fine point on exactly what volume is going to look like next year. But let\u2019s walk you through what needs to happen to have volume growth occur. In intermodal, we need international intermodal to get back to normal where U.S. consumers feel healthy and they are consuming and it\u2019s coming in off West Coast ports. That\u2019s important to us. Domestic intermodal, we need both consumers to feel good. We need truck market to tighten up a bit. So the competitive mode isn\u2019t quite as price aggressive and loose as they are right now. We need the trade deals to have a real impact on agricultural exports and imports. We need manufacturers in the industrial economy in the U.S. to gain a little bit more confidence and get their feet back under them in terms of capital investment and risk taking and then we continue \u2013 a continuation of what\u2019s going on in the petrochem industry from the standpoint of good feedstocks to make U.S. the cost \u2013 low-cost competitor for plastics manufacturing and finding markets for that plastic. So there is a lot of moving parts there. It\u2019s not one thing and of course, those moving parts will change over the course of the year. Jordan Alliger : Great. Thank you very much. Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. There has been a lot of questions about sort of the guidance and I guess, maybe I just wanted to think about if this way when you think about 2020, and maybe your expectations, if you were to see sort of upside to that, where do you think the most likely sort of places that will come from?  Or is it more volume stuff that maybe is a little bit less in your control or maybe is it a little bit more productivity or things that Jim was doing with the network just a little bit more in your control. Just want to get a sense, we do see upside that the guidance is sort of where you think it\u2019s more likely to be coming from? Lance Fritz : Yes, Chris, great question and thank you. So, the way I think about it is, if I could just invent the year that I would love to have in 2020, it would have a stronger upside. It would be a great mix. If I could magically make it happen, I\u2019d like to see frac sand come back stronger. I\u2019d like to see natural gas to go to $3.50 or $4 and take some of the pressure off coal. And I\u2019d really like to \u2013 Kenny hears this every day. But I\u2019d really like to see and experience the commercial team just relentlessly selling the new service product and getting a lot of traction quickly on convincing our customers that it\u2019s got staying power and what it means to their supply chains and being built deeply into their supply chains. That would tee up a pretty sweet year.  From the productivity side of the world, I have all the confidence in the world that our operating team, Jim, Tom, they are going after it as hard and strong as they can and it would be a blessing to have more top-line to work with. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. And then if I could just ask a question, I guess on price and mix and appreciate that the core pricing numbers are not going to be reported anymore. But when you think about some of the moving parts, I guess, sequentially from 3Q to 4Q just to help us a little bit in terms of what the pricing environment would actually look like today?  I appreciate your comments about what you think about the truckload market, Kenny\u2019s comments about how that might change as the year goes on. But, from 3Q to 4Q, can you give us a little bit of color directionally how things were kind of moving from a price mix perspective? Kenny Rocker : Yes, I would tell you, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve got formidable competitors on the truck side. And as I mentioned before, we do see that \u2013 it looks \u2013 it feels like it\u2019s bottoming out. We are expecting that to improve. You got to remember, we are coming from a third quarter to fourth quarter where we had improved service products, better dwell, stronger trip plan compliance and so we really inserted that into part of our value proposition.  So, regardless of the competitive forces out there, we want to make sure that we are pricing the product to the value that we are providing. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. And anything on mix as \u2013 mix from one quarter to the next? Lance Fritz : Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : I think it was slightly positive year-over-year when you think about, in particular although we had - coal was certainly down, but the intermodal piece was down significantly as well. So, a little bit positive. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciated. Lance Fritz : You are welcome, Chris. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. So, going back to volume, I know, Kenny, there has been a quite a few swing factors \u2013 significant swing factors in your individual items. I mean, coal was down, but intermodal minus 23% and when you give your guidance, we see a bunch of question marks in areas where there has been quite a bit of volatility.  Obviously, you haven\u2019t put question marks in your model when you came out your plus 1% volume. So I am just trying to get a little bit of sense just directionally on what you are assuming in \u2013 say, your coal Ag and intermodal, given how big those are an impact in the overall volume? On the Eastern Rails for example, I mean, they are guiding minus 15% revenue here in coal.  Obviously, you will be a little less than that. But is a high single-digit decline in your coal business a reasonable bogie for 2020? Intermodal, like you said, I mean, it was down 23% and it\u2019s going to have a tough comp in the first quarter, but again, are you projecting mid to high-single-digit recovery. Just to some way to quantify so we can gauge when we go back to investors and say, look, Union Pacific has plus 1% volume growth and it\u2019s predicated on a few things like this which gives us confidence or lack of confidence right at this point. But the question mark next to those line items that gives us a little bit of uncertainty as to what your plus 1% is implying? Jennifer Hamann : Walter, this is Jennifer. I am going to just going to reiterate our volume guidance and then let Kenny talk about the markets a little bit. So we said that we expect on a full year basis to get to the positive side of the ledger. We didn\u2019t say plus 1%. We said it just get to the positive side, but we are going to have \u2013 that does mean we are going to have to offset the declines in coal, frac sand and then a tough start to the year with the year-over-year comparisons relative to intermodal.  So, we haven\u2019t sized any of those things in terms of what the level of declines are and we are not going to. But that\u2019s all kind of in that mosaic that we\u2019ve put together is to give you that guidance that we are looking to inflect positive on a full year basis. So, Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes, we certainly feel the challenges with the low natural gas. But they \u2013 again we\u2019re three weeks into the month, three weeks into the year. I think it\u2019s premature to really look out ahead on what\u2019s going to happen there. Setting aside the Ag and the intermodal business, again, in terms of a timing perspective, the expectation is that the truck capacity should tighten up by mid-2020 and the expectation is that, from a trade perspective, things should get better for us in the second half of the year. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Understood. And coming back on the OR and I understand the 55 long-term target, but investors are pushing back a lot now on long-term targets as something to not put a lot of stock in, but clearly, Jim, you\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of work here. The data look very, very positive and amid a volume environment that to say challenging, is an understatement. And so, if we were to see a normalization, is it fair to say that within the next two years, we could see, again a normalization in 2020, could we see within a two year timeframe you are hitting those \u201clong-term over targets\u201d Jim Vena : Yes, Walter. The question of when 55 happens has a fair amount of moving parts, which is why at this point we haven\u2019t put a stake in the ground and say we think it\u2019s at this date certain. We continue to work to try to understand that ourselves and build a model and scenarios that we believe in that get the path there.  But stepping back and just thinking broadly about it, things that help would be favorable mix, more volume growth. I have a lot of confidence, all the confidence in the world in our ability to generate productivity and a great service product regardless of what the environment looks like. And then, making sure we have a pricing environment right.  We constantly talk about those three levers to pull and there is a lot of moving parts on those three levers being volume, price, and productivity. Certainly, productivity is going to get tougher and tougher as we get closer and closer to that 55. We are making a hell of a step. We made a hell of a step in 2019 and we are signing up for another good strong step in 2020 and I think over time, it will become a little more clear to us. Walter Spracklin : And do you think, Lance, if you are half way through the year, you get to more visibility to put a stake in that timeframe half way through the year when you get a little bit more datapoints to work with? Lance Fritz : Walter, we are closer to that time than we were this time last year and you and the rest of our investors and analysts will be the first to know when we are ready to put a stake in the ground. Walter Spracklin : I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Morning everybody. Jim, just wanted to check in on sort of how you are viewing operational performance versus the volumes that are coming through on the network especially as we look into the back half of the year when some of your businesses might inflect, specifically domestic intermodal given your views in the truck market, sort of your year-over-year comps. Should we look at the network being slightly more challenged in 2H 2020? Jim Vena : Though I don\u2019t see any challenge, that\u2019s the best thing that could happen is, we\u2019ve given Kenny and the whole marketing team a service product that allows them to sell, to be able to go out there and whatever the market can give, so we should be able to win and we want to win with our customers. So, as they come on, and we see a volume increase, that\u2019s the best thing that could happen.  In fact, an increase in business allows us to use the same trains with more railcars on it. It allows us to move things. There is some of course always if it\u2019s a unitrain business that comes on, you have to put new trains on, but we do everything we can to run them on manifest in intermodal trains. So, I\u2019d be very excited if the market gave us strong growth, we\u2019d put it on the same trains and you\u2019d see a incremental savings in our cost structure for the amount of revenue we bring in. So, that\u2019d be the perfect scenario for us. Jason Seidl : I\u2019ll knock on wood for that then. My follow-up question is going to be for Kenny. Kenny, how do you view the shift we\u2019ve seen in some global supply chains with the trade war? We\u2019ve seen a lot come back to North America in general, Mexico and always seen some go to Southeast Asia. How should we think about that impacting volumes from here on out? Kenny Rocker : Well, ideally, that would be short lived some of the products that originate in the Southeast Asia. As you know, a lot of that is going to the East Coast. So with a stronger trade agreement, we\u2019d expect more to come back to the West Coast.  I can tell you that we\u2019ve had really good engagement across the supply chain starting with the international intermodal folks to make the West Coast ports in the U.S. more competitive and we will continue to do that. Jason Seidl : Okay. I appreciate the color and the time as always everyone. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the time. I do have a long-term question on cost and then I wanted to have a follow-up as well. If you think about the business being down about some 20% in revenue ton miles last five years or so.  When you guys think about nominal cost inflation in this 2% to 2.5% range, is it right to think that the effective cost on the unit level for the business is a little bit higher as the base of business shrinks with the decline of coal? Or is that not the right way to think about the fixed cost leverage in the business? Jennifer Hamann : So, David, you are talking about on a revenue ton mile basis, how should we think about our cost structure. I mean, one of our challenges that we put to the team every year is that, we want to offset inflation. But when you have some of your higher RTM, I think this is where you are getting to your heavier tonnage volumes falling away from you.  That does make it harder for the team to be able to keep up with that. But I think that\u2019s the great power of the UP franchise is the productivity that we\u2019ve been able to drive and the work that\u2019s underway, quite frankly to get better at that, and to be even much more diligent with that and actually weight can be a help to us as we try to build those longer trains, that\u2019s going to improve our fuel efficiency. David Vernon : Well, I guess, it was kind of more from an effective cost inflation perspective, right did the remaining traffic on the network have a little bit more burden to pay for every year or is that not the right way to think about it? Lance Fritz : Well, clearly, we are a significant fixed cost business and what we\u2019ve demonstrated in long-term variable cost, there are different pieces that have different lives in terms of being able to adjust up or down. So, in an environment that you just mapped out, which is the one we\u2019ve lived the last five years, if volume is going down and it\u2019s going down in dramatic fashion, it is hard to keep up.  I think, one of the reasons that we are placing our employee base and the teams so much on this call is that, they\u2019ve done a hell of a job in a pretty difficult volume environment seeking out productivity even in the fourth quarter being a great example. You got volumes down double-digit percent and yet, we generated what, a couple hundred million dollars in productivity in the quarter. David Vernon : Okay. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, Jennifer, if you look at your core or your mix price on the revenue side and they are being up 2.5. It looks like there is a pretty big mix tailwind, because your declines were in your lower RPU traffic. Is that implying like a smaller conservation from core price in the fourth quarter? Or is that not the right way to read that slide? Jennifer Hamann : No, I think we got a similar question earlier and you know, mix was slightly positive in the quarter. But not a significant driver of that number. David Vernon : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So, on CapEx, you gave the guidance for this year, but I wanted to get your updated thoughts on CapEx longer term. If we are in this period where we start transitioning to a volume growth environment over the next several years, is there now enough capacity in the system to where you can hold CapEx relatively steady on an absolute basis, as we look at kind of 2021? And maybe just over the next several years? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, so, I\u2019ll start off and then Jim might want to chime in as well, but the great power that we are seeing through our Unified Plan 2020 implementation is through the idling of hump yards, closing terminals and other facilities. We are creating latent capacity in our network that we would hope to be able to deploy again as the volumes come back.  So, to your point, we do see, kind of a structural downshift that we are able to enjoy for some period relative to our capital expenditures and when you think about the number of locomotives that we have idled, the freight cars we have parked, that\u2019s capacity that we are anxious to deploy again and to be able to use in the marketplace. So I think you are thinking about it right. So, Jim, you might want to have some additional comments? Jim Vena : Well, Jennifer, I think you hit the high spots. What we are doing is this, is we are able to run the capacity. If you look at the capacity in the railroad, we are going to spend some money targeted to make sure that we can operate the trains more efficiently in places where we think we can lengthen the size of the train. But on the most of the networks, this network is built, so that we can handle more traffic. I do not see big investments in locomotives, of course.  We\u2019ve got lots of them parked. I don\u2019t see big investment in railcars. We are turning them faster, but is there going to be some targeted investments that we need for growth and for customer and just cars that are getting old?  Absolutely, keep the place current, sustainable over the long-term. So, I don\u2019t see anything on the railroad where we need to worry about spending capital to make it more efficient or worried about some business coming on.  That\u2019s the best thing that could happen and we will continue to spend capital with the projects that we\u2019ve announced. So, going down and building change in the intermodal franchise in Houston, in Chicago, and stay tuned, we\u2019ll announce some more. We are going to spend capital on those to make ourselves more efficient and have a better service product. So, it\u2019s a great place to be. We got lots of capacity. Let\u2019s bring the business on. Justin Long : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, I may have missed your answer to this on the coal outlook for 2020. I know you expect it to be down, but is there just kind of a rough sense you can give us on the order of magnitude? And I think last year, around the beginning of the year, you lost a coal contract. Is there any way to frame up how much of a headwind that was in 2019? And exactly when you start to lap that? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes, again. As I mentioned \u2013 I believe this is a little bit too early to go in and say what\u2019s going to happen out there, three weeks in, yes, we did lap the contract or we will lap that contract here this year on the coal side. Lance Fritz : Yes, and so being clear, that contract loss was lapped at the end of last year. Kenny Rocker : Correct. Lance Fritz : So this, we are now fresh ground. Kenny Rocker : Right. Justin Long : And is there any way to size that up in terms of car loads and what that headwind look like in 2019? Lance Fritz : No, we are not going to size that up, but what we\u2019ve expect out of coal this year is it\u2019s starting up pretty challenging, if natural gas stays at the $2, $2.25 level, it\u2019s going to be a tough year. Justin Long : Okay, makes sense. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone. I apologize, I missed the first part of this call. But I guess, I wanted to follow-up on that last line of questioning, Jim, specifically you know with your prior employer, we saw a lot of growth in the past decade on the network whereas Union Pacific and I know there was some specific headwinds in the coal book and what have you?  But I guess, really it\u2019s questions for Lance or Jim. What is specifically changing on the marketing or the sales front that you think you could reengage your customer base to actually drive some tonnage and revenue growth through the network? Jim Vena : Yes, I\u2019ll start and let\u2019s break growth into two pieces. One is, what are the markets like? What\u2019s the ground and the environment in which you are competing and for us as we look into this year, we think, broadly speaking, the markets start getting a little better, right. Significant tailwinds like in trade, like a soft truck market, like the pull ahead to try to avoid tariffs in international intermodal, those things start abating and lapping and so that should create a better environment for us to compete in. Second part of that question is, controlling our own destiny. And from that perspective, our commercial team historically has had an excellent relationship with their customer base. It\u2019s indicative of how we have implemented Unified Plan 2020, right? At the very beginning, we said our goal isn\u2019t to break a lot of glass and alienate our customer base, so that we have to come back around and go on a charm offensive.  Our intent was, we are going to take our customers along for the ride and keep them well informed and help them see how the changes that we are asking them to go through, as well as we are taking ourselves through to create a much better and much more reliable service product. That has occurred. That\u2019s in the process of occurring and now our commercial team is taking that and turning it into new business like the business Kenny mentioned up in Northeast Iowa, where we\u2019ve got a intermodal service product at the West Coast that two years ago would have never happened and now it\u2019s generating very attractive volumes. The same is true in the agricultural market, the same is going to be true across our bulk. Kenny Rocker : The only thing I\u2019ll add, I could rather offer few things and I want to just walk you through it. Again, the service product has improved. That\u2019s on tighter standards, so we\u2019ve got a tougher grade now for the customers that containers are being used more efficiently, because the container dwell has gone down. We\u2019ve also inserted technology into our network with our intermodal terminal reservation system, so they get clearer visibility of when they are going to get the container.  When they can expect it? We\u2019ve reduced complexity out there in the networks. Jim talked about Chicago and alluded to Houston out there. We\u2019ve talked about Santa Teresa in the past and the fact that, on an intermodal network, we expect to do a lot of block swaps there. So, really critically being transformative here on the product. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Jim Vena : Okay, Brandon. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys. Good morning. Could we just go to the capital \u2013 CapEx conversation you guys were having before? Just in terms of, you think about it, it sounds like there is some more of a targeted CapEx approach with the projects that you are implementing.  Your line of sight for the next few years with the projects, is this a sustainable level of base capital? I mean, should we expect a downward trend to that number over time? Just any thoughts there? Lance Fritz : Just let me step into that Allison. So, we\u2019ve always been targeted on our capital and by that, I mean, the very first thing we layer in is, what\u2019s it take to keep the doors open that\u2019s replacement capital and for us this year, on the track side it\u2019s $1.85-ish billion and there is a little bit more when you look over into the equipment side.  And then, from that point, we\u2019ve got to take your mandates like PTC and then we look for opportunity to invest where either there is targeted capital for growth or targeted capital for a service product enhancement which ultimately is growth or productivity. And so, everything that\u2019s in the capital plan is built like that.  It gets our first call on our cash and we are very comfortable that the level we are spending right now is an appropriate level. Sub-15% of our revenue and I don\u2019t really see that changing as we look forward. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then, just going back to the operating, you highlighted number of operating levers that you can still pull here. Not that any of them are easy, but which ones do you start to see becoming more challenging in 2020 just based on the improvements you\u2019ve made thus far? Lance Fritz : Well, you know what, it\u2019s always difficult to make big change, but I don\u2019t see any of them, we\u2019ve got a line of sight what we need to do. I think we are going to deliver on those \u2013 all those items that I listed of earlier on in the call and I don\u2019t see anything impacting us where we are not going to be able to deliver.  It\u2019s we see line of sight, we know what we have to do. We got the right people that can make sure we deliver it. And I am looking forward to just \u2013 and we are doing it in a nice smart measured way so that we don\u2019t impact our service. So, I don\u2019t see anything really holding us up. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Lance Fritz : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question. Jairam Nathan : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It\u2019s Jairam. So, I just noticed that there was a lot of talk about safety in your comments and if I look at other expenses, they were up about 5% and you talked about increased casualty cost and you are expecting another 5% increase this year. Are you kind of expecting a similar casualty number or should we see some benefits from the focus on safety? Jennifer Hamann : This is Jennifer. No, we are absolutely focused on safety as you said and we are not expecting a similar level of casualty costs. We absolutely believe we will be much better in 2020. What that 5% up guidance includes is higher state and local taxes primarily, which is we \u2013 as we become more profitable, those taxes go up. Lance Fritz : Just I want to add on safety, because I think it\u2019s really important that we talked about it for a minute and I appreciate the question. So, key foundation for a railroad and the industry and what we do every day is safety. We are not happy with the \u2013 where we are overall. Our goal is this to be the most \u2013 the best most efficient railroad in North America and that includes in safety.  So, we\u2019ve got lots of positives that we see on one side of it, but on the other side, about how we handle and measure safety, we need to get better and we are working hard. We\u2019ve seen the trend line gets better at the end of the year and I will expect us to continue that this year. Our goal is us to be the best railroad in North America and that includes the best in safety. So, that\u2019s what we are working towards. Jairam Nathan : Again, just as a follow-up, with the USMCA passing, do you see any \u2013 has that \u2013 do you see any changes near-term and how does that impact 2020 volume? Lance Fritz : Yes, so with the pass of SMCA it does take a little bit of a headwind and turn it into a tailwind. It was mostly about uncertainty and risk taking and where investment was occurring. So, I would anticipate that will have a kind of a long-term slow positive impact on our overall volumes. Jairam Nathan : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me. On the locomotives that you've got in storage, historically, Union Pacific has maintained a surge fleet. So, just curious for your thoughts on what size you might need in terms of a surge fleet and whether you would plan to start returning or selling the balance of those locomotives? Lance Fritz : Well, two things and Jennifer could jump in any time. I think, if we could find a buyer for some of the locomotives that we\u2019ve got excess, we were able to dispose of some, we would do that. And as far as a surge fleet, Cherilyn, it all comes down to \u2013 we\u2019ve got a number of locomotives in normal status that we could just go turn the switch, fuel them up and start running them.  So, if we needed to put them back in service, it would be pretty easy task and we are talking in the hundreds of that number. So, that\u2019s the surge. It\u2019s sitting there ready to go. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, and just to highlight Cherilyn, so we did in the quarter, reduced our total locomotive fleet by about 300. We sold a couple hundred. We did find a buyer and we scrapped another 100 or so. So, we are continuing to evaluate those things at all points and looking at what\u2019s the best financial decision for us to make as a company.  But we would look forward to bringing those locomotives that are in storage and putting them back into service because we do think that\u2019s the most cost-efficient way to handle future volume growth as to leverage that existing fleet. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay. And then, on the improvement in train size that you referenced, should we assume that that most of that still resides along the Sunset corridor and that the siding extensions that are penciled into the CapEx budget are directed to that region? Lance Fritz : I think, we are going to seize the extension of the Sunset with the CapEx that we are putting in on the sidings that will help, but we also see \u2013 to be able to deliver bigger trains with the volume decrease, the team did a great job.  So, if we see a volume will help us, if we have a slight uptick in volumes, but on top of that, I see benefit across the whole network. We are just starting down on the train length in every one of the corridors. So there is a little bit in all of them. A major piece will be the \u2013 through the capital investment, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. That\u2019s all for me. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Thanks for taking my question here. On the growth question, you guys have talked about an improved service product in probably a dozen of your answers to the Q&A today. That seems to be resonating with your message and it certainly is showing up in the trip playing compliance going from, call it, low 60s to mid-70s, the span of a couple of quarters here.  Are your customers starting to feel that, and when does the network get to sort of a stable steady fluid state where you really unleash the sales team and are confident that you can deliver industry plus growth on a go-forward basis? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes, just \u2013 Bascome, thank you \u2013 just to give a history lesson here, last year, during the first half, we had, what I\u2019d call both weather and a lot of changes to the network and we were talking proactively with our customers about what would happen by mid third quarter, call it, the second half of the year, our service products at the operating team gave us, I mean, it really picked up and customers really got confidence there. We have a number of internal measurements and surveys that we do, that we look at really every day and we are seeing that our customers are communicating through and then talking with them that they see it. Our sales teams, they are sitting down with them, laying out the benefits, selling the service, quantifying the value proposition is there. So it\u2019s really setting up a good 2020 for us. Bascome Majors : Thank you. And lastly, Unified 2020 Plan, I think you launched that in late 2018. Jim has been in the seat a year. Jim just took over in the CFO role and you are going to exhaust your buyback this year. Should we expect a detailed deep dive Investor Day sometime in the second half? Just anything you can do to help us on the timeline and will you be ready to give us a bigger update? Thank you. Jim Vena : Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Bascome. We are talking about when is the next good opportunity for us to \u2013 in a concentrated way, tell the story of what to expect. And so, stay tuned. We will \u2013 when that story is fully baked and needs to be shared, we will share it and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s later this year. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : All right. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions and for being with us on our call this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in April as we discuss our first quarter 2020 results. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's Web site. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, in Omaha, practicing safe social distancing are Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sakes; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our employees. During this COVID pandemic, the woman and men of Union Pacific continue to connect American businesses and communities to each other and to the world, whether it's stocking a home pantry, supplying essential goods to healthcare providers, or moving critical building blocks for U.S. industries, they're getting the job done and they're not missing a beat. Their spirit shows up in so many ways. I see it in our health and medical team, looking out for the safety of our employees. I see it in our operating team, moving the goods that make a difference in peoples' lives, and I see it in our leaders, helping us work together, staying on point and positioned for the future. Their dedication is inspirational and lays the foundation for better days ahead. Our rail network has never run better, and we continue to provide a safer, more reliable, and more efficient service product to our customers. I am so very proud of the entire Union Pacific team. Moving on to our first quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific's reporting 2020 first quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $2.15 a share. This compares to $1.4 billion or $1.93 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 59%, a 4.6 percentage point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019, and an all-time best quarterly OR. In addition to improving the efficiency of the railroad, we also made improvements in our safety results, which is always our top priority. For the quarter, our employee safety results improved 11% versus 2019. We also made progress in fuel consumption rate during the quarter. This reduces our fuel expense while also reducing our carbon footprint and the carbon footprint of our customers, which is a step in our commitment to address global warming. As I turn it over to the rest of the team you're going to hear how our first quarter results have further strengthened the Union Pacific to navigate the uncertainties that lie ahead. We'll start with Jim, and an operations update. Jim Vena : Thanks, Lance, and good morning everyone. As Lance mentioned, the railroad is healthy and operating smoothly as our customers have seen minimal rail service impact. We are taking every precaution to protect our employees. We are social distancing and using technology whenever possible to replace face-to-face interaction. Over the past few weeks, I've taken the opportunity to visit several field locations practicing good social distancing, to talk with our employees. I could not be more proud of how they remain dedicated to safely and reliably operating the railway without disruption as they recognize the critical role they play in delivering goods needed throughout our country. Their dedication is to be commended. Overall, the team had a very strong quarter. Really, the results speak for themselves. You see the impact of all the changes we've made at Union Pacific to become more efficient and provide a better service product to our customers. These changes drove an operating ratio of 59%, which was outstanding, and there are still many more opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization, and network efficiency. Now turning to slide four, I'd like to update you on our key performance metrics. For the first time, we are seeing improvement across all of our metrics, and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers. This is a direct result of our focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of our operating model. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, freight car velocity improved 8% driven by continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications. Freight car terminal dwell improved 11% largely due to improved terminal processes, transportation plan changes to eliminate car touches, and a decrease in freight car inventory levels. Building off our progress in 2019, we continue to implement changes in order to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives, which has led to an 18% improvement in locomotive productivity this quarter versus last year. As demonstrated by crew starts being down 13% in the quarter, which outpaced the 7% decline in carloads, we continue to take steps to deliver positive workforce productivity. Trip plan compliances, where our customers feel the benefit of our transformed operating model, the improvement in intermodal speaks for itself. With manifest and autos, we are holding ourselves to our higher standard as we tighten schedules, and we'll see improvements as we move forward. We are off to a great start this year, and we expect to see continued improvement in our service products going forward. Starting next week, we will provide some additional operating statistics, in particular, freight car velocity, which you have heard me say a number of times as my favorite one that I look at every morning on our Investors Web site on a weekly basis to provide more insight to how our operations are running. Let's turn to slide five. It highlights some of our recent network changes. As a part of our continued implementation of position-scheduled railroading, we consolidated mechanical shops in the L.A. Basin and Houston areas. In the L.A. Basin, we've consolidated from three shops to one; while in Houston we've gone from two shops to operating just one as well. Increasing train size remains one of our main areas of focus and we are making excellent progress. At our recently completed Santa Teresa block swop facility, we are consolidating intermodal traffic from our eastern ramps destined to port terminals in Los Angeles Long Beach area. This allows us to operate longer more efficient trains across the Sunset Route, and provide a better more consistent service product to our customers. We also completed eight 15,000 foot sidings as a part of our 2020 capital plan to extend sidings in targeted locations. These sidings support our efficiency initiatives by increasing the number of long trains we can operate in each direction, thus reducing demand for crew starts. By putting more products on fewer trains we have increased train length across our system by 19% or over 1,300 feet since the fourth quarter of 2019, to approximately 8,400 feet in the first quarter of 2020. The capital we are investing to improve productivity as well as to maintain the safe efficient network is critical to the long-term health of our railroad. Given the current business levels and uncertain economic environment, we are planning to trim back our 2020 spend by $150 million to $200 million. To wrap up, we are committed to protecting our employees' health and safety while providing uninterrupted critical service to support the nation's supply chain. While we're early in the second quarter, so far we have been able to hold steady and maintain train length gains as volumes have dropped. We continue to evaluate our transportation plan, including yard and local schedules, in order to meet customers' demands while balancing our resources and assets to meet current volumes. Since the latter half of March, as volumes decline more steeply, we stored additional locomotives and railcars. However those locomotives remain in at-the-ready status and both assets are available to add back quickly as volumes return. We have also furloughed additional employees. However, we are increasing our auxiliary work and training status force to be prepared should volumes come back quickly or in the event of an outbreak within a group of the employees. We have made great progress at this point; however we will continue to transform our operations in order to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on our business environment. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was down 7%, primarily due to declines in our Premium and Bulk business groups. The decrease in volume was partially offset by a 5% improvement in the average revenue per car, and drove freight revenue to be down 3% in the quarter. So, let's take a closer look at how the first quarter played out for each of our business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 5% on a 7% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 19% as a result of softer market conditions from historically low natural gas prices and a mild winter. Looking ahead, we expect continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain low and customer stockpile stay at high level. Weather conditions will also continue to be a factor. Volume for grain and grain products was up 4% primarily driven by strong export ethanol volume. This was partially offset by reduced shipments of export wheat. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 7% predominantly due to strong domestic fertilizer shipments. Finally, food and beverage was up 2% in unit as we saw strength in beer shipments become slightly offset by reduced refrigerated and dry food which were impacted by a challenging truck environment. Industrial revenue was up 3% with a 3% increase in volume and flat average revenue per car due to mix. Energy and specialized increased 10% primarily driven by strength in petroleum as favorable Canadian spread facilitated stronger crude oil shipment to the Gulf earlier in the quarter. However, with the reduction of oil prices in the past week, we expect crude oil shipment to be impacted in the near term. Forest products volume was flat. Reduced paper shipments were offset by increased lumber shipments due to strong housing start and a mild winter during the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments grew by 4% due to the strength in domestic and export plastic shipments along with strong demand of detergents and chemicals. Metals and minerals volume decreased by 3%, reduced sand shipments from the impact of local sand and drilling decline were partially offset by continued strength in rock shipments in the South coupled with increased metal shipment. We expect to see continued challenges in sand with oil prices remaining at lower level. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 6% on a 12% decrease in volume while average revenue per car improved by 6%. Automotive shipments were strong for the most of the first quarter until the pandemic shut down OEM in North America in the last few weeks of March, resulting in a 1% decline in volume year-over-year. Domestic intermodal volume declined 5%, driven by soft market demand and surplus truck capacity coupled with weakness related to the pandemic later in the quarter. International intermodal volume was down 24% during the quarter. Weakness early in the quarter was related to challenging comparisons with 2019 driven by accelerated shipments related to the tariff policy implementation. Further weakness was driven by pandemic-related supply chain disruption that began in China had slowly impacted much of Asia. Looking ahead, there remains quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding this global pandemic that we are facing. With the freefall in economic indicators over the past few weeks and uncertainty about when we will see the COVID pandemic curve starts to flatten out, an accurate assessment of 2020 is hard to pinpoint at this time. As you can see, our volume in the second quarter has started off slowing with the volume down 22% so far driven by auto production shutdowns and retail closure as U.S. demand is constrained by the pandemic-related social distancing and quarantine. Many of the auto manufacturing plants are scheduled to be shutdown until at least early May. Already our auto shipments have been down around 80% in the second quarter so far. Likewise, the recent projections in Mexico indicate that some manufacturing sectors like auto will be shut down for similar time periods as well. However, the CARES Act that was recently signed offers some upside to open the economy for business and improve unemployment for America plus it also encouraging to see that much of Asia is restarting production along with China's recent purchases of U.S. grains. More importantly, I like to make this point clear, we are not letting the uncertainty of the economy hold us back. We are staying focused on what we can control. The good news is that the lower cost structure combined with the improved service products that we've achieved with Unified Plan 2020 is a competitive advantage for us, customers are recognizing it, and awarding us new business. As Lance and Jim mentioned before, the railroad has never run better. I want to thank our employees as they are taking the necessary precautions to stay safe and healthy, so we can keep the operations running for our customers. We will continue to stay in close contact with our customers, and we are ready when the supply chains recover. As demand improves, we expect our strongest service products will place us in a great position to win incremental opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk about our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.15, and an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59%. Our fourth consecutive quarter starting with a five comparing our first quarter results to 2019 there are a few puts and takes. Last year, we incurred higher weather-related expenses, and you may also recall that we received a payroll tax refund that benefited both our operating ratio and earnings per share. As shown on slide 13, these two items had an offsetting impact in our 2020 results. Fuel was an unexpected tailwind in the quarter and likely will be for much of 2020 as the year-over-year fuel production -- fuel price reductions favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 80 basis points and added $0.04 earnings per share. Setting inside those items, core margin improvement for the quarter was a remarkable 3.8 points, and added $0.18 earnings per share, as we continue to demonstrate the power of our operating model, as well as the ability to flex our cost structure in the face of volume challenges. Thanks to the dedication and results of the entire Union Pacific team. We took another significant step forward to our goal of operating the most efficient reliable and consistent railroad in North America. Looking now at our first quarter income statement, 2020 operating revenue totaled $5.2 billion, down 3% versus last year on a 7% year-over-year volume decrease, demonstrating our ability to be more than volume variable, operating expense decreased 10% to $3.1 billion. These results net to operating income of $2.1 billion, a 9% increase versus 2019. Below the line, other income decreased compared to 2019 as the payroll tax refund I referenced on the prior slide included $27 million of interest income. Interest expense increase 13% due to increased debt levels, while income tax expense also was higher up 11% due to higher pre-tax income in the quarter. Net income of $1.5 billion was up 6% versus last year, which when combined with our share repurchase activity led to an 11% increase in earnings per share to $2.15. Looking at revenue for the first quarter Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4.9 billion down 2.5% versus last year. While not able to offset the impact of the 7% lower volumes, the combination of favorable business mix, and our pricing actions had nearly a five-point positive impact on our quarterly freight revenue. Positive mix in the quarter was driven by lower intermodal shipments, partially offset by lower sand volume. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue declined $47 million in the quarter to $351 million, and impacted freight revenue by 25 basis points. Drivers of the decline were lower volume and fuel prices. Now, let's move to slide 16, which provide a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. Through our Unified Plan 2020, and G55 + 0 initiatives, we drove improvement across all cost categories. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 12% year-over-year, primarily as a result of our workforce and productivity initiatives. Total first quarter workforce declined 15%, or about 6200 full-time equivalent versus last year. Sequentially, our workforce is down 2%. Breaking the year-over-year, reduction is down a little more, we saw a 19% decrease in our train and engine workforce, while management engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 13%. This expense category also benefited from last year-over-year weather-related cost offset by the payroll tax refund I referenced earlier. Fuel expense decreased 18% as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed with a more efficient operations. Our consumption rates for the quarter improved 5% versus last year to a first quarter best level. Decreased costs associated with maintaining smaller active locomotive fleet as well as lower weather-related costs were key drivers of the 10% reduction in purchase services and materials expense. In addition, as we use both our locomotive and car fleet more efficiently, we've been able to lower lease expense, which largely contributed to the 12% decline in equipment and other rents. With regard to other expense, which was down 2% in the quarter, we recorded an adjustment to our bad debt reserve to recognize uncertainty related to certain customer receivables due to the potential impact of COVID-19. That expense increase was offset by running a safer railroad, which lower destroyed equipment costs as well as freight loss and damage expense. Finally, for full-year 2020, we now expect year-over-year depreciation expense to be flat. Looking at productivity and our cost structure, net productivity totaled approximately $220 million in the first quarter. As Jim detailed earlier, with our improved key performance indicators, the successful implementation and enhancement of our operating plan is increasing efficiency while at the same time providing a superior service product for our customers. As we've discussed in the past, we view productivity as a volume neutral measure. In other words, we're reporting only that part of our cost savings attributable to the actions we are taking, but as we enter this recessionary period sparked by COVID-19 I'd like to make a couple of comments about volume variability, in particular as it relates to prior recessions. First and most importantly, Union Pacific is running at efficiency levels that we've never experienced before as a company. For example, we were more than volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the strong productivity focus embedded in unified plan 2020. We've also taken more than 1500 basis points off of our operating ratio since the great financial crisis in 2008, 2009. That further strengthens our ability to manage through today's challenges and emerged stronger on the other side. Moving to cash generation, as we face these fluid and uncertain times, we recognize the need to maintain ample liquidity with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong cash generation, I can confidently say that we are well positioned for the challenges we are facing. Cash from operations in the first quarter increased 10% versus 2019 to $2.2 billion. Free cash flow after dividend and after capital investments totaled over $1.3 billion, resulting in a 91% cash conversion rate. We also returned $3.6 billion to shareholders during the first quarter through the continued payment of an industry leading dividend and the repurchase of 14 million shares of our common stock. Share purchases were funded in part from our January debt issuance. Union Pacific strong investment grade credit rating and a very attractive interest rate market allowed us to issue $3 billion of new debt. A portion of that issuance funded the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in February and the rest is for 2020 debt maturities. We finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times, in line with our previously stated goal of maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings no lower than BBB plus and BAA1. Although COVID-19 was not contemplated when we originally set our leverage targets back in 2018, the decision to manage our balance sheet in line with a strong investment grade credit rating was clearly the right one. We maintain an active dialogue with our rating agencies and at this time they are comfortable with our current leveraged position. We finished the first quarter with $1.1 billion of cash on hand. However, in an abundance of caution, we issued $750 million of 30 year notes in early April to further increase liquidity. As of yesterday, our cash balance was around $2 billion and we have additional levers available if needed. The current bond market is open to us as evidenced by our April issuance. We also have $2 billion of credit available under our undrawn credit revolver and up to an additional $400 million available under our receivable securitization facility, which is 50% drawn at this time. As we sit here today, we do not believe it will be necessary to tap those additional sources, but we view them as a prudent backstop to have at the ready. Turning now to our 2020 outlook, we are formally withdrawing much of our previous guidance in light of the current economic uncertainties. In particular, we are no longer providing guidance for the full-year 2020 volume, headcount, operating ratio, or share repurchases. To date, we have repurchased roughly $17 billion of the targeted $20 billion three year program that is set to conclude at the end of this year. We will continue to monitor business conditions and adjust this activity as we see prudent, but with share repurchases currently paused, completion of the full $20 billion seems less likely today. As you heard from Kenny a moment ago, our second quarter car loadings are currently down 22%, and our current view is that volumes for the full quarter could be down around 25% or so. With volumes declines of that magnitude we are taking actions across the board to right-size our resources and manage expenses. Even with aggressive action however, it is unlikely we can improve our second quarter operating ratio on a year-over-year basis with that level of volumes loss. Unchanging for 2020 is our long-standing guidance around pricing. We still expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. With regard to productivity we are widening our range of expectations for full-year 2020 to $400 million to $500 million. We clearly got off to a very strong start in the first quarter, and our commitment to productivity is unwavering. However, we also recognize that the loss of volume leverage is a challenge. In terms of cash generation and cash allocation we've modeled a number of different down volume scenarios. In each we plan to maintain the dividend but with the capital modifications Jim mentioned, and a suspension of share repurchases. The outcome of that exercise is a strong confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow after dividends in some pretty dire economic conditions. This is a testament to the earnings power of our franchise, as demonstrated by our first quarter results. Although frustrated by current conditions, the potential is clearly there. Longer-term, our guidance of capital expenditures of less than 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings, and ultimately that 55% operating ratio remain intact. As you have heard from the entire leadership team today, we are unwavering in our commitment to improving safety, efficiency, and service as well all firmly believe in the strong long-term prospects of our company. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. Our first priority has been and will always be safety. We made good progress on safety in the first quarter, and I expect continued improvement. From a service and efficiency perspective I am so thankful that we went through the tough process of implementing the Unified Plan 2020 over the last 18 months. That work has put us in a position of great strength to deal with the future. When the time arrives, where COVID-19 is largely behind us, Union Pacific will be well positioned for long-term growth and excellent returns. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Jim, as you think about the persistent reduction in coal tonnage and the GTM intensity of that network, do you see opportunity for, or are you considering making any structural changes that might reduce maintenance capital requirements, probably any thoughts you could share about how you're thinking about the coal network going forward? Jim Vena : Listen, the coal network was built to handle way more trains than we're handling. So, it starts off on a separate piece of the railroad, so there's no if, ands or buts that we're going to -- we're looking at that. We've got plans to be able to take advantage and use some of that, both in maintenance and some of the capital that we've put on the ground in there. On some of the other network, a little more difficult because if the -- it just mixes up with the rest of the trains we run, but absolutely, Allison, we've got a plan of when some segment of the railroad sees a downturn in traffic that we fix it. The big challenge for Kenny is this : I want him to fill it up. So I think he's got a great service product, and we get out there and fill out those pieces that are [technical difficulty] -- running with less traffic right now. Allison Landry : Okay, and then could you give us a sense for how much train starts are down in April? And then in terms of just headcount declines, do you think you can continue to outpace volume declines in the next quarter too? And if there's any way to sort of parse out what percentage you think would be the structural takeout versus how much would likely come back with a recovery in demand? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Okay. So, so far, I'll tell you the team has done a spectacular job. We are -- actually our train size has grown in April, not come down. So are full-bore, everyone is on looking at how we make this place with what the traffic that's offered to us and make it the most efficient. So it's actually gone up in size, train size in April. You'll see that when -- as we report next or you'll see it from how we talk at different conferences. As far as people, I think we've done a great job of staying ahead of the game. There would come a point where it's difficult to stay ahead of the drop in business, but so far, even up to this point right now with the traffic that we see in April, we've been able to stay ahead and be productive in that we are dropping more than the adjustment in business, but I'll tell you I'm no -- there's a certain point when it's impossible to do, so we're not there yet. Allison Landry : Okay, excellent. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thanks for the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Jennifer, I didn't fully touch your comment around the OR for the second quarter. Did you say it was going to be down year-over-year or were you preparing it sequentially, I wasn't exactly -- I don't think I understood exactly what you were saying there? Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Amit. No, my comment was on a year-over-year basis, and saying that with volumes declines that we're expecting of this magnitude, so down 25% or so, it's unlikely that we would be able to improve our operating ratio in the quarter. It was a quarter-only comment on a year-over-year -- Amit Mehrotra : Right, okay, got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification, and then Jim, I just want to come back to Allison's question really quickly. Obviously the 25% decline in volume, it's a bit unique I guess in the quarter because the decline in revenue is so significant but also kind of short-lived, which introduces a whole host of other dynamics in terms of how you manage the labor and other costs of the business that might need to ramp back up. So if you could just talk to us how you manage that, I mean, basically PSR is important, but -- and thank god you guys did it in the context of what's happening currently, but is the second quarter just going to like reflect more of a normal kind of 50%, 60% decremental margin quarter because a lot of those costs that you would normally have to structurally kind of move away has to remain because you have to prepare for the -- the hopefully V-shaped recovery on the other side. Just help us think about how you manage through this dynamic that's a little bit unique? Jim Vena : Well, listen, that was a multi-person answer question. I think Jennifer wants to jump in, but let me just start with what I see. You can see that we're high double-digit drop in the number of employees already versus where the business dropped, and so, it gives us a chance to be able to be there, and that's why in the comment the way I answered Allison's question. I'm very comfortable that at this place, I don't know what's going to happen to the business, I'm open for a big V coming back, but who knows. So we are prepared and preparing to make sure that we do not set ourselves up. That if the business comes back in quicker than some people think that we're prepared for it. So that's why the way we parked our locomotives. We've got lots of locomotives. I don't even want to talk about how many we've got parked right now, it's so many. I worry more about the productivity number that's out there, that's what's real key is how many -- so we've got locomotives ready to go. The business comes back, if it comes back slow or fast we're ready for it, and people, we have been smart about how we manage all the labor that we have. So we are purposefully, at this point, because of the substantial drop over a short period of time that we have put people in places so that we can recall them. They cost us a little bit of less money, but they're available real quick to return to the railroad so we don't impact. Service is key for us, you know, you can't be running an efficient railroad, and I've always said that, and I know some people mix this whole thing up, PSR and service. So you can't have a good operating railroad that will operate safely if you don't have customers that want to come on it, and that's what we're building. I think we're there. Kenny should be able to go out and sell it, but at the end of the day that's what we're all about. Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, I mean, so we're obviously not going to give guidance on decremental margins. Again, you look at our first quarter performance, very strong. We were more than 100% volume variable, but I think when you thinking about how we look at the second quarter, I mean obviously 25% down volumes, and you -- your earlier questioner was asking around the operating ratio. It's tough to keep up in terms of your cost cutting when you have volumes come out that fast. We are going to be very aggressive and do everything we can, but we are not going to give specific guidance relative to headcount for second quarter or relative to the margins, but just know we're going to pull every lever available to us. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Okay, I'll keep it at two, guys. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Kenny, can you just go through the impacts of energy across the portfolio, specifically look, you mentioned crude before, but want to hear a little bit more about perhaps natural gas, what that does to the plastics producers in the Gulf Coast, and is it -- I hear your comments on coal, but is it too early to think about some potential upside in coal, if we were to see an improvement as production gets shut down? Kenny Rocker : Yes, I'll walk you across pretty quickly here. The coal prices have just dropped here even over the last few months. There are some levels that we haven't seen in a while. I'm sure you see the same for curve forecast, and we'll see what happens there, but there is nothing that leads us to believe there is going to be large upside with coal, but we'll keep working with Jim's team to get the productivity that we can get out of it. The other part of the energy side of course is the oil prices, and you've seen what has happened there on the petroleum side with crude oil. We'll see what happens with those prices. Those prices also have an impact on our sand business in terms of drilling and then to a lesser degree the drilling pipe segments also. As you look at our plastics business, there is going to be an impact on our plastics business. I will tell you that there is more production that has come off, and there's more production that will come on. That is a positive for us. We're hearing that the -- or we know that the operating rates, where a number of our plastics producers has taken a step down, but that's still a very positive segment for us. I will say this, and I want to end it all with this, at the end of the day, our service product has been as good as it has been as we continue to see other pieces of carload business come up for us to bid on and compete for. I really like the position that the service product has put us in. Brian Ossenbeck : Thanks, Kenny. So, a follow-up for maybe Jennifer and Jim, I believe last time we talked, you are targeting $500 million plus productivity gain, which is more volume neutral and looks like now you're taking it down a little bit at least from how we see it here. So, maybe you can just give us a little bit of context to that if included the volume environment is different, but this is a volume neutral sort of metric, maybe you can help bridge the gap there between the two numbers? Jennifer Hamann : Sure. So, you're right, we do take out the volume variability part of the cost. So, if we're going to have fewer train starts because of lower costs, we don't count that in the number, but if we have reduced train starts, like through Jim's long train productivity initiatives, those are things that we put into our productivity number. My comment was meant to say is that when you have less volume, it's harder to leverage that, and so, when we were putting together our plan for 2020, recall, we originally said we were looking for a little bit of positive volume growth when we gave the guidance of $500 million or so productivity. We've obviously taken that volume growth off the table in terms of what we're seeing today, and so, that's why we feel like we need to widen that range a little bit in the $400 million to $500 million range. So that's how you should think about that, but Jim, you might want to add a little more? Jim Vena : So, Jennifer, and Brian, listen, $220 million first quarter starts us off real well to be able to deliver what we said, I think it's prudent that we look at it because if you drop volume, you have less chance to reduce, and just the way we measure cost takeout, it's true cost, there isn't anything, volume doesn't help us, but I'll tell you this, there's a list of things that I still want to get done, and with that, the way we operate our locals, the way we're handling our intermodal terminals to make them more efficient, the train size is still there, we can be more fluid with how we handle the railcars. You've seen us shut down a couple of diesel shops. So, all those things are still out there, and unless really the markets changed for us even more, I'm very comfortable with where Jennifer's got us guidance for this year. I'm very comfortable. I won't use the word go by, otherwise Jennifer will get excited, but I'm very comfortable with where we are. Lance Fritz : Brian, this is Lance. I just want to add. It's really simple to think about, if in this quarter as we anticipate volumes are off something like 25%, you got to take something like 25% of your activity out of the railroad to match before we start talking about incremental productivity. So, the basis for which you're going to create productivity gets very, very difficult when you take an order of magnitude change like that. On the opposite side, if you're growing 3%, 4%, 5% gives you all the opportunity not to add resources in and you can count that all as productivity. Brian Ossenbeck : Great, it sounds like there's a calculation aspect to the kind of like your core pricing, so just wanted to make sure that was clear. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about volume if we could. The 25% decline in the second quarter is not too far off of where we're running kind of currently here, which would suggest that maybe we're getting closer to the bottom. I want to get a sense maybe Kenny for you discussions with your customers or maybe each individual business line, can you walk us through sort of what are the puts and takes to kind of get you comfort with that 25 number, we appreciate you given it but kind of curious what's the sort of drivers behind that? Kenny Rocker : Yes, so first of all, I believe you all see some of the information that we see publicly in terms of where the automotive OEMs are and they appear to be coming back sometime next month, call that the first-half of May. Clearly, there is going to be some ramp-up issues with that maybe they wouldn't start at 100%. We'll keep an eye on where that is as we look across our industrial customers. There are some customers that we're still seeing produce at a pretty strong clip. Rail network is still working pretty well. On the grain side, we're pretty optimistic there. We'll see what happens over the next few months. We do know that China has come in and purchase some grain during the back half of the year. We would expect that we should see some benefit from the Phase 1 deal, and then as you look at how as we're talking to our customers on the consumer side, I'll call those international intermodal and our domestic customers, I'll tell you, they still don't have that line of sight and what's going to happen. So we're not in a position, I'm not in a position even though we're talking to him every day to tell you what will happen there. Lance Fritz : So Chris, this is Lance, let me step that back up and come up to a higher level of depth and length of our downturn. So we're learning every week a little bit more about the dynamics of how deep it might be and how long it might be. It's still very unclear and the goalposts are pretty broad that you can hear very well educated, deeply experienced economists that still think about a V-recovery. You hear about W-recoveries, U-recoveries, a slow hockey stick ramp-up. I think our collective belief at this point is it's sharp and deep, it's going to last for a while, and recovery is going to be some kind of ramp but probably not terribly steep, and so, we're looking for those markers and nothing would please me more than to be wrong about this 25 percent-ish, and see some time in the second quarter that we're starting to see demand firm and our supply chains reflected, but there's a lot that needs to happen between here and there. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that, and maybe coming back to the productivity comment and maybe this is for you Lance or Jim or Jennifer, I guess when you think about that sort of dynamic of volumes coming out of that that was very helpful to give us some of that perspective about sort of the base kind of going away in terms of generating productivity. So, is it reasonable to think that sort of 2Q is going to be there very much challenging sort of quarter to get that productivity and that maybe that sort of remainder of the 400 to 500 is more back end weighted to be for 3Q and 4Q when the volume dynamic is hopefully a little bit more stable? Lance Fritz : No, I don't think we're saying that specifically. I think what we're saying is, with such an abrupt downturn and the depth of it, productivity is going to be harder to come by. So for instance it's very unlikely, and it would be unreasonable to think about the second quarter in the $200 million order of magnitude like we saw in the first quarter, but I don't think a reasonable expectation is no productivity. I wouldn't expect that from us. Kenny Rocker : Listen, we are spending capital and we have the sidings that I mentioned earlier on in place. We expect the train size to go up and have less train starts for the business that we have. So, that's productivity. We expect to be more productive with our local assignments and local operations. We expect to be more productive on our intermodal facilities and how we handle the traffic that we have. So as much as volume does make some of it harder, I'd love to have the whole time. Love to have a quarter with 2% or 3% volume growth hang on. I'd love to see where that number is, but it is not there because I'm not real worried about not having productivity this quarter. Jennifer Hamann : And just a quick reminder, I mean, our comparisons on a year -over-year basis relative to productivity get harder through the course of the year. We closed out the year with close to $200 million, $215 million of productivity. So, take all of those comments kind of into your mosaic of how you think about it, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Got it, that's very helpful. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that on your volume outlook there, Lance, I guess if you're running it down kind of 20, 22 now, and you're targeting down 25% for the quarter, are you expecting things to get worse from here or are you not anticipating things reopening I mean, I guess just thinking about this only in the third, fourth week of April. You still have two months left and with things maybe apparently starting to reopen, are you expecting things to deteriorate from here? Lance Fritz : Well, part of what we're making that commentary on is reflective of how we're planning for the second quarter. So, we tend to be pretty conservative. There is a lot of unknowns. I don't think we know enough yet to know what's left to deteriorate in the demand economy versus how that's going to be offset by recovery. So there's just a lot of moving parts and I think above 25%-ish is a good marker for us to plan our activity around. We've mentioned it to you as a result, and we'll hope for better. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : I want to just give you a view from my seat when our commercial teams go then and we talk to our customers, we're talking about -- after we go through our safety side, the second thing we talk about is the service product and Jim is exactly right. We've got a very strong service product to sell. We talked about the car velocity improving to make us more competitive with truck light services, as we entered into the year, what I would tell you is that on a carload basis, we felt really good about some of the wins in some key markets and we felt really good about opening up new markets that we hadn't touched. On our domestic intermodal side, we're about two-thirds along the way through our big season. We felt very good. I mean we felt very good about what we won in that area. So we need the market to help us there. Even in our international intermodal business towards the back half of the year, there have been some jump ball opportunities that we feel really good about that we've won that you should see so. Coming into the year, we felt really good about our opportunity to compete. The service product is something that we're going to use to make the pie larger to compete against truck, but we felt really confident wants the market comes back. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Kenny. Thanks, Lance. I guess if I could just switch over to Jim or Jen from my follow -up, you talked about trimming CapEx that's contrasting a little bit what we've heard from some of the others who look to take advantage of the downturn, maybe to get some cheaper build out capabilities. Can you maybe talk about that, and Jim can you clarify the status on the locomotive fleet and the park capacity? Thanks. Jim Vena : Well, listen to Ken. It's a good question in that, usually the way I like to look at it is if you have a downturn of business and you know it's going to come back why adjust your capital program at all. We went through it and it's more like a timing that rolls into next year. This is not anything that everything that we had in the capital plan was built for to make this railroad better, more productive, safer and sustainable over the long-term. So we're not changing that, but we thought it was prudent with where the revenues are at this point in the business level to just slide some of it into an early part of next year, and because we give a guidance on a year-to-year basis, that's what's happening. So we are not -- absolutely there is some areas where we're going to spend money faster and we can see that. So if we have some opportunity even after we make the adjustment in the capital to be able to use some of that cash because we're more efficient, we'll spend it this year at this point, but stay tuned, and we'll adjust it as we see what's happened to the business. Jennifer, anything else? Jennifer Hamann : No, I think you summed it up, Jim. Jim Vena : Okay, nice. Thanks again. Ken Hoexter : Thanks guys, and just the local fleet numbers. Kenny Rocker : I appreciate the thought. Jim Vena : I'm sorry, Ken, you broke up. Ken Hoexter : Oh, just the local fleet, Jim mentioned. Jim Vena : Oh. Listen, we've got so many locomotives part that I'm just about embarrassed to say how many we have parked, okay. So, there's some noise in it right now because of the business drop, but this is a number I look at, Ken, and I gave it to you at 18% improvement and locomotive productivity is the key number. We have lots of locomotives part. We're good if the business comes back, we're good if the business grows. We are being smart; we're putting all the technology, we've got the best locomotives and you can see the fuel efficiency that we said five, but you could take some of the noise out but a true 4% betterment. So there are some locomotors, we have a lot of them parked and we continue to park them every day right now with where we are with the business levels. Kenny Rocker : Hi, Jim. There's something we don't talk a lot about. There's two ways to look at our stored locomotives. There's locomotives that are stored and intended to be stored for a while. That is we don't anticipate their need in the next week to month, and then, Jim's got other locomotives that we store in a low -- in a status called at the ready, and at the ready, are literally ready to be pulled out and put back into service on a moment's notice, and so, that mix is changing every day, but the at the readies allow us to react to business upturn, which we hope we see, and we hope it's a strong week, that'd be great. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the time guys there. I appreciate it. Kenny Rocker : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to just follow-up on something I heard earlier, Jim and the answer to the first question. Were you suggesting that April headcount is down more than volume, so down sort of more than 20%? And then, Jennifer I totally get second quarter or commentary. You've got some cushion with the strength of the first quarter, any thoughts at all about the ability to improve for a full-year basis? Lance Fritz : You are going to start, Jim\u2026 Jim Vena : Sure, sure. Listen, I'll start real quick, just to clear up the whole discussion about people, we have -- we started at 19% drop that we've announced over the first quarter year-over-year, and we think that we will continue to drop that down as the business comes down and with some productivity. I'm not sure where we're going to end up exactly, but stay tuned. I think we've got a great story moving ahead. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, and just to clarify on Jim's comment that 19% is our train and engine crew. Jim Vena : Right. Jennifer Hamann : So that's the part of our workforce, not the whole workforce. So to your question, Scott then about full-year or no you know we pulled that guidance off the table and it really is going to be dependent on what happens in the marketplace, the commentary that you've heard us have here today. Again, we would love to see volumes come back and in that environment. You know, we feel very, very good about our potential and when you saw what we did was down 7% volumes in the first quarter, making very strong improvements in our operating ratio and that's the kind of call that the proof statement test case whatever for words you want to put around that. In terms of what we're capable of, so we're just not going to give any guidance right now because we don't have great visibility to what volumes are going to be, other than where we think second quarter is going to end out, but let's stay tuned on that and if that changes and starts to turn around a little bit. You bet; I mean we think we've got great long-term opportunities. Jim Vena : Absolutely, we're looking forward to when our markets start returning to normal, because to Jennifer's point the first quarter is an absolute proof statement of what we're capable of doing. Scott Group : So I guess that's actually my follow-up, if I can like so. A 59 in the first quarter to me is a full-year run rate, somewhere in the mid-50s range, whenever, not this year, obviously, but whenever things normalize. Is there anything about that 59 and 1Q that you feel is sort of not sustainable that we shouldn't think about sort of what the earnings power is in a couple of years, when things\u2026 Jim Vena : Not making a commentary on your math on what it translates into for the full-year. That 59 in the first quarter was clean. Scott Group : Right, thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks, Scott. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning, and impressive performance against the tough backdrop, clearly. I wanted to ask you what Jim, if you could offer some thoughts on the kind of the PSR process it's like, sometimes you say well like, a softer volume environment a little bit easier to make some big structural changes. I think it'd be fair to say this is more than a soft volume environment. So, how do you think about the PSR changes the pace of change, and whether you can take another look at structural position, so you say, we had 14 carload terminals we now have whatever your number is. Maybe we -- it doesn't need to be nine; it could be five or six. How do you think about that just in terms of I'm thinking of the intermodal and carload terminal network, and whether you have now a chance to say oh, we can ratchet that down even further? Or maybe it's outside the terminal networks, it's something else? Jim Vena : Tom, by now, I don't like to get away ahead and guess on what we're going to do next, and a lot of it is driven by car flow. So I think we have. We shut and idled five hump yards already, and there's probably possibility for more depending on how the traffic flows are, and we'll do that at the right time. Fort Worth cost us a little noise for a while, in the first quarter operationally and so you need to make sure you bet these things down well you don't impact the operation, but we see opportunities still and it doesn't matter where the volume is, it -- whether the volume is down or up, I see productivity, that we can and efficiency that we can get out of the place, and it's across the board. It's how we manage the number of people that we have that need to manage the processes we put in place for intermodal. Later on this year we're going to have consolidation in Chicago, down to three intermodal facilities from six. So I think that's great for us. We are looking at what we're doing down in the LA basin to see how we can give a better service product and be able to see -- touch the customer in a better way and the whole LA basin. So Tom, there's still lots out there. I see lots of opportunity but I'm being rolled. Hopefully I'm being smart, and I'll let Lance and Jennifer and Kenny give me the feedback, but we're trying to do this, or I'm trying to do it in a systematic manner where we don't impact the customer to the point where we lose business because of what we're doing, and we're able to do it and I think, and I've been here just over a year. I think it's been successful, great leadership from everybody at the table here with me. This is a team effort. So, I'm real happy and I -- there's lots of opportunity left, I must have just answered it, someone's going to ask me what any I mean, it's not football season anymore, it's not baseball season and I hope it was baseball season, but it's still like I got half of the game to go yet. Okay. Lance Fritz : Hey, Tom. Part of your question also kind of is contemplating again depth and length of this downturn, and that's what makes our decisions the most difficult right now. So right now what we've got is decisions that we've made about resources like our exports, so that some part of our furloughed crews are more accessible to us quickly we've talked about at the ready locomotives. We've taken an action here on our non-agreement workforce and instead of taking a large scale of permanent force reduction. We thought for this period of time it's more prudent to ask our non-agreement workforce to take required unpaid leave of absence, so a week a month for four months. All of those actions are with an eye towards recovery is going to occur. We need to be ready for it, we need to be ready for whatever shape it takes, and still do what's prudent in the current environment, we think we got that balance. Tom Wadewitz : Right, okay, that makes a lot of sense. For my second question, just wanted to -- I guess, ask a question about the kind of price versus volume, calculate, I guess is the truck market is, there's obviously a lot of excess capacity out there. So probably in the near-term trucks compete a bit harder and maybe they can even compete on longer length of haul that might affect whereas we normally think Eastern rails are more affected by truck, kind of how do you manage the pricing approach? It's great to be really disciplined on price but that could cause some further share loss to truck in certain segments on a near-term basis. I don't know Kenny or Lance, if you want to offer thoughts on the kind of view versus truck and price versus volume approach? Lance Fritz : Sure. Let me start and Kenny will give it some fine points. Parts of our pricing philosophy, the core pricing philosophy is unchanged and that's about having to generate a return on whatever piece of business we secure and making sure that our price reflects our value. What is cool about having fundamentally shifted our cost structure is that it opens up more markets to us. Clearly, trucks are very competitive in a loose market like what we've got right now. There is going to be elements of truck competitive business that makes no sense for us to pursue because somebody in the trucking world is willing to take it just to generate enough cash to survive, but our cost structure opens up a broader segment of that market to compete and win and generate an attractive return and we're doing that. Kenny Rocker : Yes, the only thing I'll mention is that again just to go back to the car velocity number and that's an average number, there is some mark areas where that car velocity number is much greater, and it has given us the ability to go out there and get the pricing that we believe we should be receiving or the service product that we're providing our customers. There is tremendous value that we're talking about when we talk to our customers and we're renewing business and going after new business and asking them to open up their truck lines for us. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Okay, thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : Thank you,Tom. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm sorry, but just to follow-up on the productivity targets again a little bit confused because in a based on the commentary about the changing range, it does sound like the productivity target is somewhat related to volume growth. So is it fair to say that you are now at the stage of PSR a lot of the cost side like the fat and the company has been taken out, and it's mostly going to be an efficiency/volume driven or improvement story from here? Lance Fritz : Okay. I'll start, Ravi. This is Lance. So the short answer is it's always easier for us to get productivity in a growing environment than in a shrinking environment. We've proven we can get it in a shrinking environment. When you shrink at 25%, it gets really, really difficult. It doesn't go to zero, but it just gets pretty difficult. In terms of PSR and fat clearly at 59 operating ratio, there is a less easy opportunity than there was at 69 operating ratio, but there is still opportunity in Jim's outlined many of them. Kenny Rocker : Well, Lance, I think you hit that perfect unless there's a follow-up on it. Ravi Shanker : Yes. That's maybe, Lance, I have a follow-up for you, kind of just thinking big picture. Do you think a situation like this going to be unprecedented shutdowns you're seeing right now, again going back to the adage of never waste a good crisis. I mean, do you see some of your customers making permanent changes in their domestic or global supply chains, and does that mean some of that is at risk for you, some of that as an opportunity kind of what do you see are some of the kinds of permanent changes coming to supply chain in the future? Lance Fritz : That's a great question, Ravi, and for sure there are going to be some opportunities that grow out of this crisis. One is we do hear our customers talking about evaluating their supply chains with an eye towards reliability being valued a little bit higher. That means near shoring or on-shoring some of those supply chains, and that would be a good thing for us generally speaking, we haven't necessarily seen that happen. I think it's way too early. I don't think you're going to see wholesale investment happen until suppliers. The industry starts becoming more confident in the demand side, but clearly I think we're going to see that, and that'll benefit, Mexico it'll benefit our, to and from Mexico business, and it will probably benefit our inside the United States businesses as well. Ravi Shanker : Great, thank you. Lance Fritz : Yep. Thanks, Ravi. Operator : And next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on some of the intermodal commentary. Obviously we've seen a substantial decline in fuel prices, and it doesn't sound like the energy market is coming back anytime soon. Does that change the way you think about long-term growth in your domestic intermodal business, or with the service improvements that you've seen and continue to see, do you think this is still a GDP plus business when the economy bounces back given if the energy market doesn't bounce back? Lance Fritz : Yes. There is no change in how we look at the business plus changes that are service product is much, much stronger now and much more reliable and gives an opportunity to compete and win out there, and as I mentioned we are in two-thirds into the bid season. On the domestic side, we feel really good about the wins that are out there. I can't predict what's going to happen with GDP when it -- where those numbers are going to go, but I can predict that the service product is going to allow us to compete and win, and I feel just as confident and feel just as committed to what our commercial team is doing on the international intermodal side too. Justin Long : Okay, and maybe as a follow-up on mix, obviously, it was positive here in the first quarter, but going forward, how are you thinking about general merchandize versus intermodal on a relative basis as we kind of think about the magnitude of the volume decline that we could see in the near term? And also just the timing of the recovery between those two segments? Just wanted to get your high level thoughts on how those businesses perform on a relative basis if we think about the implications of mix? Jim Vena : Well, if you are thinking about relative basis and for that you are talking about margin by commodity or product line, we like them all, and we have talked about how we've done a lot of work to fundamentally improve the intermodal margins to a point where we would love to see that grow like anything else, but this mix that you saw here has a lot to do with the fact we are getting 1200 bucks a box for every move of intermodal versus 25 or 3000 bucks for a carload box. Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean in the first quarter obviously just look at it on an average revenue per car basis of our three business teams, the group that has the highest average revenue per car is our industrial team, and that's the group that has a little bit of growth for us here in the first quarter. So, those are the lines we have sort of given you guys the revenue ton per mile information on a broader segment of business, and so, I would just continue to watch that. We don't know what business is going to come back first, and so, that's really going to be the driver in terms of how the economy restarts and where that comes through. If it comes through in the manufacturing sector, that might be a positive for us. If it comes through more in the consumer goods and we are seeing more intermodal move, you see it there. I am less worried about mix and more concerned about what absolute volume is going to do, and that's where we want to see the market come back to us. Justin Long : Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Jennifer, you did say that you have solid free cash flow expectation after dividend under various scenarios. So, I am going to sneak in there and ask if you are going to share some of those scenarios with us even hypothetically, but more importantly, I guess that continuing - you know, maybe lesser demand environment you can still protect your dividend. I guess would you be looking at leverage as that first source of liquidity, or would be capital spending? I guess where are the priorities in a weaker environment? Jennifer Hamann : So, I appreciate the question about sharing the scenarios, but obviously you know that I am not going to do that. In terms of our cash priorities, I mean you have heard us consistently talk about we are going to invest in the business for the long-term that's what we are in this world to do is run a railroad and serve our customers, and grow the business, and so, Jim laid out very well for you how we are prioritizing that, and so, the first dollar goes to the capital investment, and we have our dividend which we very much committed to. We view that as an important part of our return to shareholders, and then, the excess free cash we have been using for share repurchases and that priority in terms of our spend is unchanged at this point. Jim Vena : Yes. The first claim goes to keeping the railroad running and running well. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Well, thank you, Operator. Most are asked and answered at this point, but wanted to circle back to remark that two-thirds of your domestic intermodal business has been sort of re-priced, so you have gotten through that. Just wanted to see if you guys can give a little bit more color on that commentary and how you think that pricing markets going to shape out going forward? And what are your plans as you approach that particularly since you are improving your service product? So, what you're offering now is a lot different than you were, what you were offering, let's say three, four years ago? Lance Fritz : Thanks for that question. You've got a number of things going on. We've got a much stronger service product, which is going to help us as we're competing against all the modes call it barge, rail or truck, but we also have a lower cost structure which helps us get into some of these newer markets. What I will tell you is that because our service product has been so strong, I think that's been the change X factor for us to go out and win this new business. We are able to get a longer haul or compete more closely with the truck fleet. So we're going to continue to price as a service product. We expect to be over inflation. There's nothing that shows me we wouldn't be able to do that even though right now, there's a lot of truck capacity out there. Jason Seidl : Okay, so you said that other two-thirds that you priced, that's been over inflation and you expect the remaining third to be priced over inflation as well, even in this difficult market? Lance Fritz : That's true. That's correct. That's an excellent way to think about it. Jason Seidl : Fantastic, appreciate the time as always and everyone please be safe out there. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jason. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, you too. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I want to focus my questions on the rebound, not so much when it's going to happen, but how you're going to handle the different potential shapes of that rebound that you alluded to and I guess the first question perhaps for Jim, I mean, there's a lot of complexity out there with regards to non-essential goods kind of being filling warehouses and essential goods having run. I think when things start to clear out, is there any concern that a sharp recovery is going to be aggravated by the complexity of cleaning out the system, so to speak. How are you preparing for, if we do see a faster rebound, how you handle that without being bogged down? Jim Vena : Walter, listen, this is a great question. This is an extraordinary event. It's affecting the economy in a completely different way than I think anything, we've ever seen. So, we don't know whether it's going to be a quick up or it's going to be a slow up, but this is what we've done, we have prepared ourselves with the key ingredients you need to operate the railroad and rebound. So it's locomotives, people, we are out there every day and I give everybody at Union Pacific and all the people that are out there working that are still out there working every day, not just the Union Pacific accolades because our employees have come to work, and we have had no major issues with being able to move any of our trains, but what we're doing to get ready is the railroads in a safe manner. We're out there putting capital in, we have locomotives ready to go, like we've got enough locomotives that it could go back to where we were before. They are in a state where within hours, we can turn them back on and put them out in the fleet if we need to. We have people instead of following them completely, we're carrying a few extra and not just a few but we decided that it was a smart thing to do that be able to put the people back on to be able to operate the train. So we've done everything we can to handle whether it's a V, whether it's a U or it's and I'm hoping for a sharp turn. I hope the economy personally turns and everybody can get back to work and live the life that we had before, but if not we're set up to be ready for it, Walter. Walter Spracklin : And the second question here is related to a prior question, and Lance answered the question by the opportunity being near-shoring. Two other opportunities, I wanted you to ask, wanting you to comment on? First of all, does this give you, I guess on Jim side, the ability to bring people back at lower resource levels and easier to do than cutting them down to that level? If this didn't happen, and secondly, how would you, how would rail fit into the e-commerce trend in a world where e-commerce is ramping-up far faster than previously anticipated? How does rail provide a solution if this new world sees a lot more e-commerce purchases? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Let me start Jim and then I'll turn it over to you. So, on the e-commerce question, clearly we're seeing e-commerce continue to penetrate in retail. We think that changes the opportunity, we don't think it decreases the opportunity. It changes supply chains, we still have a need to get from both to distribution site. Clearly, we're not part of hours or one-day delivery, but we don't have to be. What we have to be as part of the supply chain that gets product to the forward distribution sites that can fulfill like that, and we are and we continue to do that. So what it really says is we need to have our eyes wide open on the winners in that world and align well with them, and then I'll let Jim answer the question on resources and bringing them back. Jim Vena : Walter, when we have whatever starting point we're at and we're at this point, absolutely because we see productivity gains, so we will not recall the same number of people back to work as we adjusted down. So, no if ands or buts, whether it was, whether we were for workforce when we have productivity gains that would have brought it down or now as it comes back, we just won't need quite as many people as we had before. Train size is one, we've got, if we can keep the train size up, we're going to need less people. So that's a good way to think about it, Walter. Walter Spracklin : I appreciate the time. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for taking my question, Jennifer, you understand the desire not to guide headcount in a very volume uncertain environment, but I was hoping you could kind of give us $1 framework for the executive pay temporary reductions and the sort of rotating leave of absences you've got with the Management workforce. Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks Bascome. I'm going to decline that opportunity. It's part of everything that we're doing to manage our cost structure and pulling all the levers across the board, and you've heard us talk about that before, and you saw it in the first quarter where we were able to make improvement in every one of our cost categories, and so, this is part of certainly the comp and benefits line, but we've got work going on across the board, and that's really the way that we look at it is in that context. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Bascome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes, hi. Just a quick question, obviously, had a pretty good degree of variable costs in the first quarter, when you think about it the expenses, total expenses now as you look out over a full-year basis. How would you describe or ascribe variable costs versus fixed costs or semi-variable on sort of the whole cost base? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Yes, let me get started, and I know Jennifer has been thinking about this a lot. We did look backwards into the last recession, the Great Recession, and looked at our variable versus fixed at that time, what we communicated to the world and what we actually executed, and we did a better job through the recession than we thought based on what we thought was variable and fixed at that time. I can tell you in going into this downturn, we're even more agile and flexible than we were in the last downturn. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, I mean, when we went back and did some of that, that work that Lance referenced, I think by the time we got through the recession, kind of call it end of 2009, we would have said we were maybe 80% volume variable or so adjusted for fuel. We said we were more than 100% already here in first quarter of 2020. So again, we have already been taken and that's the blessing of what we embarked with PSR and unified plan 2020 is we have already made significant changes in our cost structure, and when you think about yard closures, increasing train length, all of those things and the locomotive productivity we're seeing, that's given us great, much greater volume variability. Obviously, in the short-term, those areas that are the most volume variable for us are going to be on the comp and benefits line, fuel is almost 100% volume variable for us. Equipment rents is also pretty, pretty volume variable, and then everything else is something that over time, we'll continue to work through, but that's where I again, I think we're just in a very good position or in a different position than we were in the last recession because of all the work that we had already undertaken and have in the pipeline because of our unified plan 2020 efforts. Lance Fritz : And Jordan, Jennifer, I think the critical difference is speed of decision making and speed of implementation, that that's fundamentally different today and a benefit. Jordan Alliger : Great, thank you for those thoughts. Lance Fritz : Yes, sure. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time. Jennifer, I wanted to ask on the -- or Ken maybe, I wanted to ask you the step up in the mix price benefit from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much of that extra tailwind is from the mix side versus the price side? And if you think about within the commodity groups is there any one particular driver of commodities that led to a better mix from the price utilization standpoint? Jennifer Hamann : Well, thanks for the question, David. But we're not giving specific pricing guidance any longer. I think we made that statement a couple of quarters ago, so I'm not going to break that out for you, but I think consistent with my commentary, the less intermodal was certainly a part of that mix when you think that that is our lowest arc business that we have on the railroad, and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we also had sand lower, but net-net it was still a positive. Again, if you really look at that Industrial line, that's where we had some good growth in the quarter, and that's where we have some strong arc. David Vernon : Okay. And then I guess as you think about the separate line on fuel, the fuel surcharge headwind sort of moderated a little bit into lower oil price. Does that also have like a mix component in it or like what are we looking at there in terms of the sequential step-down in that fuel headwind into a lower fuel price environment? Jennifer Hamann : Well, I think as I said, fuel was actually a tailwind for us in the quarter. And that's kind of an all-in view in terms of the price, the surcharge, all taken together in terms of how we view that. There is a little bit of a lag year-over-year as we move into the second quarter as fuel prices have come down so steeply. But we don't see that as being a significant driver relative to the -- how we look at things on a mix basis. David Vernon : But is there a reason why the surcharge headwind to revenue would moderate into lower fuel, just wanted to -- I'm just trying to understand how that number. Jennifer Hamann : Oh, the headwind to revenue? David Vernon : Yes. Jennifer Hamann : No. I mean it is a factor in the overall arcs. As you see less fuel surcharge that's going to be reflected in the arcs we have. But as I mentioned, it does lag a little bit in terms of how fuel price comes down and how our surcharge comes down. David Vernon : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just one for me, Jennifer, the buyback cause completely prudent, trimming the CapEx also makes a ton of sense. I assume you talked with the credit agencies around the time of your debt issuance earlier this month. So just any change of tone from that perspective around leveraged targets and do you feel you're kind of bumping up against the top end of 2.7 times, and how that impacts your decisions to take on some of the additional liquidity, which you said you don't need right now, but just in case 2Q bleeds into 3Q at these levels? Jennifer Hamann : Sure. So we've used the 2.7 as just kind of a shorthand math for you all in terms of expressing where we view that within kind of the context of our credit rating. To your point, we did have dialogue with the credit agency around the time of our $750 million issuance. We share with them kind of our best thinking, some of our scenarios. And as I mentioned in my comments, they're comfortable with where we're at. Certainly if we had a need to go back into the markets we would have that dialogue again, but we feel very good where we're at. We believe we've got good access to credit if we need that. And we've obviously got some other things in terms of our revolver and the receivables facility if we need to, but those are, I would call, more of a belts-than-suspenders approach, but we feel good about it. I have no concerns there, and I believe the rating agency feel good with us as well. Jon Chappell : All right, thanks, Jen. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. David Ross : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Jim, wanted to talk about that first slide you put up regarding service level goals, specifically around manifest and auto trip plan compliance. Is there anything you guys have articulated as to where you want that to go, from 64 today? Jim Vena : History tells me that with different customers the manifest business is a little bit different. This tried to reflect what we have committed to the customer, and we are measuring ourselves harder than what we actually committed to the customer as far as what their trip plan is on the individual railcar. So, you never get this number to a 100 just the same as the intermodal never gets to a 100. It's impossible to get there, but I think I would like to see it another double digit improvement, and I think if we do another double digit improvement the way we measure it, we remove most of the noise or a lot of the noise on how the interaction is of us living up to what we have committed to the customer. So, that's the way I look at it, David. Lance Fritz : Hey, Jim, a little bit of whatever the number was 64-65 in the first quarter was self-inflected. You mentioned on the call that we had a little noise around our change in Fort Worth at Davidson Yard, where you stopped humping at Davidson, and that impacted that to a degree for probably six weeks. So, I would expect to your point, we are growing that number to start with a seven. Kenny Rocker : What's was not reflected in that number is that the transit times have gotten better. That's one thing, and I can tell you that our customers are acknowledging that the service on the carload side has gotten better. Jim Vena : Yes. David Ross : And are there any commodities that are harder to handle that would reduce the productivity with the manifest network, so if you have more of X than Y, it slows it down? Lance Fritz : Absolutely, if you have cars that you don't touch as often, makes it easier for you to be able to handle. So, we are bulk railroad. Some people are bulk railroads more than we are at this point then you will load them up at one place and you haul them to the other. I am going to say is my mother could do that. So, it's a lot easier to get a number of it, so yes, but other traffic we have to handle in multiple and more steps. You have a better chance to have a failure somewhere in the process. Jim Vena : And we love that business. Lance Fritz : I love it all. Jim Vena : We love that. Lance Fritz : We got a railroad that can fill up, so I love it all. David Ross : I am sure your mom is glad you are following in family footstep. Jim Vena : Well, we have to finish this call with a little humor, [multiple speakers] and David, and to everybody, I should have mentioned even more, and I know Lance will, but listen, I am really proud of everybody and also everybody out there that is working to keep this country going from people at the frontline everywhere. So, thank you very much. David Ross : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. Thank you participating with us this morning and for doing what you need to keep yourselves and your families, your loved ones safe and healthy. We look forward to talking with you again in July to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. Until then, I wish you all good health. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much, Rob, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha practicing safe social distancing are Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, Chief Financial Officer.  Before discussing our second quarter results, I must first recognize the continued dedication of the women and men of Union Pacific. As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees are protecting themselves and their coworkers in order to provide our customers with a service product that's fluid and uninterrupted. Our rail network continues to operate at a very high level as we provide a safer, more reliable and more efficient service product to our customers. As I reflect on what we dealt with and the results of the quarter, the true character of our organization was revealed, and it makes me very proud of the entire Union Pacific team.  Moving on to the second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2020 second quarter net income of $1.1 billion or $1.67 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $2.22 per share in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting the economic impact of the pandemic and the challenge of overcoming a 24% decline in revenue, our quarterly operating ratio came in at 61%, a 1.4 percentage point increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. Despite the distractions created by the pandemic, our employees made progress on safety in the second quarter. For the first half of 2020, our employee safety results improved 5% versus 2019. I am very appreciative of our employees' continued focus on safety. Our second quarter results represent an achievement by the entire UP team as we dealt with a challenge unlike anything we've seen before. The women and men of Union Pacific answered the call to serve our customers, and the results provide further confirmation of the transformation our company has made through Unified Plan 2020. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide an operations update. Jim Vena : Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Lance's comments on how the UP team has performed throughout the pandemic. I'm extremely proud of the team's dedication to providing the safe and reliable service product to our customers. Our rail network remains fluid. I also want to commend the operating department on its performance over the past quarter, how the team managed through the rapid decline and eventual return of volume has been truly remarkable. The impact of all the changes we made is evident in our results this quarter. There remain many more opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency.  Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators, driven by continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications and car touches, freight car velocity improved at 11% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Freight car terminal dwell improved 16%, largely due to improved terminal processes and transportation plan changes to eliminate switches and touch points. We continue to implement changes in order to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives. In the second quarter, we achieved a quarterly record in locomotive productivity, a 12% improvement versus last year. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, was flat versus last year, reflecting the impact of the steep decline in volumes in April. As we've adjusted resources, realized productivity gains and seen volumes increase, this metric has rebounded strongly. In the quarter, the productivity improvements were boosted by reducing our train and engine workforce by 32%, which outpaced volume declines.  Trip plan compliance improved for both intermodal and manifest in autos during the quarter. This is a direct result of our focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of our operating model. We had a strong first half of the year, and we expect to see continued improvements in our service product going forward.  Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. Increasing train size remains 1 of our main areas of focus, and we are making excellent progress. Capital investments to extend sidings allow longer trains to run in both directions and reduce the number of train starts. There are around 40 projects included in the plan, and we have made good progress as 16,000, 15,000 foot sidings have now been completed through the first half of the year. We plan to have another 4 completed by the end of this month.  In addition, by putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by 23% to over 1,600 feet since the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 8,700 feet in the second quarter of 2020. This is a remarkable feat by the team to run longer trains with less volume while also making service gains. This indicates that we struck the right balance in prioritizing our actions during the quarter. We are continually modifying our transportation plan, including yard and local service to be more efficient. This contributed to our productivity gains by allowing us to reduce our daily crew starts while continuing to meet customer demands. We continue to make progress on our redesign of the intermodal network. As we've discussed before, we are completely redesigning our Chicago operations. In the second quarter, we closed Global 3, and additional changes will be completed by year-end. We are also redesigning the Houston area. Construction is underway at Settegast to consolidate our intermodal facilities into one location. In addition, we recently initiated construction at Houston Englewood Yard to expand switching capability and improve our ability to run longer trains out of that yard. Let me wrap up. We remain committed to protecting our employees' health and safety and providing strong service to our customers. As customers have resumed operations and volume has been increasing over the past month or so, the operating team has done a great job of balancing our resources while also providing superior service to our customers. We stored locomotives and railcars strategically placed. We have had the resources available when and where we need them. In addition, we are recalling employees from furlough to meet crew demand. However, we are leveraging our efficiencies and not bringing back resources on a one-for-one basis with volume. We have made great progress to this point, and we will continue to transform our operations in order to further improve safety, service, asset utilization and network efficiency.  And with that, Kenny, it's all yours. Kenyatta Rocker : Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, our volume was down 20% as many of our market segments were negatively impacted from COVID pandemic effects on manufacturing and retail sectors. The decrease in volume, coupled with a 6% lower average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 24% in the quarter.  So let's take a closer look at how the second quarter played out for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 17% on a 15% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 24% as a result of softer market conditions from historically low natural gas prices and soft export demand. Looking ahead, we expect continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain low. Also, weather conditions will continue to be a factor.  Volume from grain and grain products was down 6% as the pandemic reduced demand for ethanol and related products. This was partially offset by increased shipments of export feed grain. Looking forward, we continue to have a more positive outlook on grain exports due to purchases by China. In addition, we expect ethanol production to continue its recovery from historical lows in the second quarter.  Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were slightly down 2%, driven by a onetime shipment in 2019 related to tight barge capacity due to the [indiscernible]. Finally, food and beverage was down 21%, primarily driven by COVID related production challenges for import beer and supply chain shifts in other food products.  Industrial revenue declined 23% with an 18% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 6% due to negative mix and lower fuel store charge. Energy and specialized decreased 26%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices conversion with economic shutdown impact on demand. The second half of 2020 potential for crew by rail remains largely uncertain. If oil prices remain depressed, we anticipate continued year-over-year decline.  Forest product volume decreased by 11%. Fewer lumber shipments were driven by mill curtailments due to a reduction in housing starts. In addition, industrial chemicals and plastic shipments declined by 10% due to pandemic-related impacts on demand. Industrial chemicals volume had the largest reductions as these carloads are closely tied to industrial production.  Metals and minerals volumes decreased by 19% due primarily to reduced sand shipments from drilling budget reductions associated with the decline in oil prices and a surplus of local sand. We expect to see continued challenges in sand with oil prices, combined with the recent financial risk that frac sand producers are facing coupled with continued in-basin supply. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 33% on a 23% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car declined 13% due to a negative mix in traffic. Automotive volume was down 64% for the quarter. Most North American plant productions were temporarily suspended during the first several weeks of the quarter, which depressed our automotive shipments of up to 90%, which was the lowest point during the quarter. The majority of the manufacturers resume production by mid-May, and our volume for the last week of the quarter recover within 15% and of 2019's volume.  Intermodal volume declined 12% year-over-year, driven largely by pandemic related items like shelter and place orders, which force retailers to temporarily close. Softer international and domestic truckload shipments were partially offset by strength in parcel shipments related to e-commerce. Weekly intermodal volumes bottomed in mid-April, down approximately 25% year-over-year, but our weekly run rates have been improving since that time.  Looking ahead, there still remains quite a bit of uncertainty as COVID evolves. As local economies reverse recent reopening, we remain watchful on their impact to supply chain. As we start off the third quarter, we are encouraged with the rebound in volume-driven by our premium business segment as automotive and intermodal supply chains restock inventory and adjust to evolving demand. E-commerce strength is likely to continue, and volumes will be bolstered by recent business wins. We will also be watching automotive demand and any potential downtime for auto plant retooling as it could pose challenges to our current run rates.  The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is at 13.2 million units, down 22% from 2019. In addition, we're closely watching unemployment levels and truck utilization rates as they have a direct impact on demand in a competitive landscape. While the macroeconomics for energy and industrial production are forecasted to be negative in the third quarter, we're focused on what we can control. In fact, the team has been able to win new business throughout our premium and manifest networks. Our car velocity improvements allow us to better compete with trucks and opens new markets for us. And finally, I wanted to take an opportunity to thank our employees for the preventative measures they are using to stay safe and healthy. So we can keep operations running for our customers.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk to you about our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier, Union Pacific is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.67 and a quarterly operating ratio of 61%. Looking a little deeper at our second quarter results compared to 2019, there are a couple of items I'd like to call out. Last year, we incurred higher weather-related expenses that negatively impacted the quarter. And in second quarter 2020, we received the final insurance recovery of $25 million related to 2019 weather. Together, these items favorably impacted our year-over-year operating ratio, 90 basis points and earnings per share by $0.05.  Additionally, you'll recall that we received a payroll tax refund in second quarter 2019 that added $0.04 to earnings per share and benefited the operating ratio by 70 basis points. Fuel provided a significant tailwind in the quarter as the year-over-year fuel price reduction favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio 270 basis points and added $0.09 to earnings per share. While today's low fuel prices do provide a short term benefit, we prefer the trade-off of higher prices, coupled with increased business.  Looking at our core results, we took a step back on our operating ratio in the quarter, which deteriorated 430 basis points with the corresponding reduction in earnings per share of $0.72. Despite our swift and strong actions to cut costs and drive productivity, we could not fully offset the impact of the steep volume decline we experienced at the start of the second quarter.  Finally, our quarterly results include recognition of $69 million related to a real estate sale with the Illinois Tollway. While the sale does not impact our quarterly operating ratio, it added $0.07 to second quarter EPS. So all in, really solid results for our railroad despite some extraordinary circumstances.  Looking now at our second quarter income statement. 2020 operating revenue totaled $4.2 billion, down 24% versus last year on a 20% year-over-year volume decline. Demonstrating our ability to adjust cost with volume, operating expense decreased 22% to $2.6 billion. These results net to operating income of nearly $1.7 billion, a 27% decrease versus 2019. Other income of $131 million includes the real estate sale I just mentioned.  Interest expense increased 12% due to increased debt levels, while income tax expense was lower, down 25% as a result of lower pretax quarterly income. Net income of $1.1 billion declined 28% versus last year, which when combined with the impact of our share repurchase activity, led to a 25% decrease in earnings per share to $1.67.  Taking a more close look at second quarter revenue. Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4 billion, down 24% versus last year. Although the revenue decline was primarily driven by the 20% reduction in volume, the combination of price and mix negatively impacted revenue by about 2.25 points. The results of our pricing actions were positive in the quarter and continued to yield dollars in excess of inflation. However, those gains were more than offset by negative business mix related to steep declines in second quarter automotive, sand and crude volumes. In addition, a 43% decrease in diesel fuel prices in the quarter versus last year partially offset by the roughly 2 month lag in our fuel surcharge recovery programs impacted freight revenue by 2.25 points. Now let's move to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses. As you saw in Kenny's carloading chart, we experienced a pretty dramatic change in our business volumes through the quarter, dipping as low as 120,007 day carloads in April and then peaking near 150,000 to close the quarter. In the face of the volume decline, we reacted quickly to manage costs and adjust resources while still providing our customers with an excellent service product. As a result of these efforts, second quarter expenses were around 85% volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis, a strong achievement for the entire UP team, especially when you consider that we exited the quarter more rightsized than we entered it.  In terms of the different expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased 21% year-over-year, primarily as a result of workforce reductions and productivity initiatives. Second quarter workforce levels declined 22% or about 8,600 full-time equivalents versus last year and sequentially decreased 11%.  As Jim mentioned earlier, our train and engine workforce was more than volume-variable, down 32%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 17%. Fuel expense decreased 56% as a result of the significantly lower diesel fuel prices and lower volumes in the quarter, while our consumption rate was basically flat year-over-year. Purchase services and materials expense fell 23% in the quarter, as we used our locomotive fleet more productively, enabling us to store more locomotives and maintain a smaller active fleet. In addition, our loop subsidiary incurred less drayage expense as a result of auto plant shutdowns and lower intermodal volumes. Equipment and other rents declined 19%, led by car higher savings and lower lease expense for both locomotives and freight cars. We are continuing to use freight cars more productively as evidenced by our gains in freight car velocity and terminal dwell. Other expense was only down 5% in the quarter, reflecting the somewhat fixed cost nature of this expense line. Although we benefited from running a safer railroad in the second quarter and saw reduced business travel expense, those savings were partially offset by lease impairments, lower equity income from our FXE investment and increases in state and local taxes, which makes up the majority of this cost category. The insurance recovery I mentioned earlier is also reflected in these results. Looking now at productivity. We generated strong net productivity, totaling approximately $185 million in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned earlier, the operating department's continued progress on train length initiatives, balanced with an improved service product, was especially impressive this quarter, given the severe volume decline. And while we have already achieved the low end of the full year productivity range provided back in April, we do expect the pace of our productivity efforts to moderate some against a tougher second half comparison. We had a tailwind from weather events in the first half of 2019, which contrasts sharply with last year's strong second half productivity of $360 million. Nonetheless, our commitment to continued productivity is unwavering, and we now expect to exceed $500 million for full year 2020.  Moving on to cash and liquidity. As we've discussed previously, Union Pacific's strong balance sheet, our ability to generate cash and available liquidity enabled us to navigate the pandemic cost business fall off and remain in a position of strength.  Cash from operations in the first half of 2020 increased 13% versus 2019 to $4.4 billion. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $2.8 billion, resulting in a 107% cash conversion rate, which was helped a bit by first half income tax payment deferrals. We finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to main strong investment-grade credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's.  Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. Now this balance is more than we would typically hold and includes $300 million of short-term borrowing completed earlier in the second quarter to bolster our liquidity as well as the nearly $600 million in deferred tax payments I just referenced. Finally, in the second quarter, we returned value to our shareholders through our industry-leading quarterly dividend payout and remain committed to providing strong cash returns to our owners.  Turning now to our second half outlook. Although some items are more certain today than when we reported first quarter earnings back in April, there are still many unknowns. You just heard Kenny talk with some optimism about our second half 2020 business volumes, which are foundational to our guidance update. Assuming we maintain a consistent volume trend and we do not experience the second wave of economic shutdowns, we expect our full year volumes to be down 10% or so. As I pointed out earlier, we expect productivity to exceed $500 million for full year 2020. And with regard to pricing, our long-standing guidance is unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. Although we are facing a very competitive marketplace today, we are committed to making sure each piece of business we move is earning an adequate return. Together, our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce year-over-year operating ratio improvement on a full year basis in 2020.  While the year certainly isn't playing out the way we had earlier anticipated, we are very pleased by both our ability to manage costs in the downturn, as well as how we are now handling increased freight demand without adding back cost on a one-for-one basis.  In terms of cash generation and capital allocation, we are more bullish on both given our current outlook. Full year capital expenditures will likely come in a little more than $2.9 billion as we continue to make good progress on our renewal and productivity investments. We plan to maintain the dividend, but we are still paused as to share repurchases. We all see the news of COVID cases spiking in various parts of the U.S. and globally. So we plan to stay in a conservative posture for now. Longer term, our guidance of capital expenditures below 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and ultimately, a 55% operating ratio remain intact.  Now before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to thank the exceptional employees of Union Pacific who continue to meet the service needs of our customers during this pandemic. They are leading the charge daily towards our collective goal of operating the safest, most efficient and most reliable railroad in North America.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. Our first priority has been and will always be safety. We made good progress on safety in the first half of the year, and I expect continued improvement in the second half. From a service and efficiency perspective, we took another step forward toward our strategic priority of operational excellence. The experience of the past 3 to 6 months has validated why we are transforming our company through the Unified Plan 2020. Our ability to be nimble and flexible in adjusting our resources to a rapid, severe decline in volume, while also improving our service product demonstrates the strength of our service model. As we continue to navigate the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our optimism for the future is unchanged. Union Pacific is well positioned for a future of long-term growth and excellent returns.  With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : Jim, maybe a sort of bigger picture question. When you think about you've been through in terms of a very rapid decline in volume and then kind of a bounce back as we've seen here, you clearly made some strong efforts to control costs and sort of rightsize the network to a degree. Do you think this sort of, I guess, improves the potential of the business as you look forward? Are there lessons learned from here structurally that I think will potentially benefit? And when you think out to 2021, if you'd allow me, I guess, maybe how should we be thinking about incremental margins? Is that changed? Is any of that math changed based on what you guys have done so far? Jim Vena : Well, why don't I just start with the -- Chris, and I appreciate the question. So I think key to look at is you always learn something. And when you -- I've been in railroad for a long time. I've seen drop in business. This was a big drop. The good part about it was we were set up in the right way. We were productive before. We had already started in a lot of things, from engineering, mechanical, operations, local service, 5 hump yards shut down, touch points off. So we have done lots to be able to be ready for any action that was going to happen. And we took the right actions this quarter, and you can see it in the key performance metrics. Those are productivity numbers. Those are not against the -- so we were able to drop more than what the business level changed on us.  So what we learned was, and I knew it and the team knows it, there's more there. So what we figured out was we can do more with less and even more than we thought. So across the spectrum and how we look at it, we've always balanced, Chris, and this is really important, and you heard Kenny talk about this, it's about service, too. We did not take and make all the cuts just so that we could drop our cost down and impact our service because we want to win in the marketplace. And Kenny is optimistic that we're headed in the right way there. Lance Fritz : And as regards your incremental margin question for next year, Chris, of course, we don't guide on incremental margin. But we do remain optimistic about in a world where we get volume growing. We're going to generate productivity. We've got a pricing structure that works that should generate improved margins. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Hoexter : Lance or Jim, Jim you just mentioned kind of some increased competition and given the truck market is getting tighter and prices seem to be going up there. Are you referring more to rail to rail pricing competition? Maybe just give a little bit of thoughts on pricing. You mentioned kind of pricing moving above inflation. Maybe walk through a little bit more of the mix impact given the ARCs were down about 6% and give us some insight into the market. Lance Fritz : Yes. Ken, let me start, and then I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to talk a little bit about what he sees in the pricing world. When we're talking about a very competitive market, it reflects both still a relatively loose, but tightening truck capacity market and strong competition from our rail competitors. So that's a level set we're talking both worlds. From the standpoint of mix, bear in mind, we mentioned it, but the automotive business is very good high ARC business. And in the first half of the quarter, it literally went to about zero. Kenny mentioned 90% off. But that all by itself is a significant mix impact. And Kenny, you want to talk about the pricing dynamics? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. Look, Ken, first of all, thanks for the question. And I just want to really iterate something that Jennifer mentioned, which is one, we have a positive pricing results and that we're going to exceed the cost of inflation. So it's critical we just kind of take that off the table. But as you look at the dynamics in the marketplace, I'll tell you, it was challenging to really price. What helps us is that we have a very strong service product. When you can walk in and talk to your customers about -- we're moving costs from their side, we're moving assets, delivering on time, getting the equipment on time, you're able to go in and have some really tough conversations to sell the price for the service that you're delivering on. So that's that.  To Lance's point, I do want to just talk about the automotive network coming back. If you look at the data points out there, the inventories are the lowest that they've been in the last 9 years. So we know the dealerships need to replenish. We've been talking to our OEM customers, and we'd expect retooling throughout the rest of the quarter, but maybe not as deep as what we thought it be or what we've seen in the past. We'll keep an eye on the fleet sales. But looking forward, we feel pretty optimistic. I feel pretty optimistic about how things are shaping up. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about some of the changes in the network. And how you think about, like, I guess, schedule and train starts and train length are kind of a good one to think about in terms of operating leverage. So I don't know, Jim, if you can offer some thoughts on like what was the reduction in train starts? And how much of the consolidation can persist as you go forward and you just show operating leverage in kind of longer trains as volume comes back? Jim Vena : That's a great question. I love that question because that's exactly what we're trying to do. So we came in with productivity gains before the pandemic hit. So what we were able to do was we accelerated it. And if you take a look at the metrics underneath the productivity metrics, by having trains that are longer, we were able to have way less starts. So the starts are like 2 to 3x better than what they were on a flat basis. So that's important to us. The touches of the cars, the whole change in network of having less touch points was be able to take costs out. We spent a lot of time before the pandemic and then during the pandemic, we assigned the way we did local service, not the less on the amount of service we provide customers but be smart about how we service that. It was when they released the cars and we looked at our network, and that made a huge impact. So that's what we continue to do, Tom. And the way I see it going forward, what's left, someone's going to ask me the question, and I will answer it, I'll save a question, is this, there is opportunity across the board in operations still. Is it as easy as walking in like I did the first day at Pine Bluff and said we're shutting it down and after I was here for two weeks? No. I don't think. But I've got my eye on a couple of yards that need to be tuned up. And if they don't tune up, they'll be gone. But other than that, I'm very happy with where we are, and we've got productivity across the board, as Jennifer said, on the $500 million. So hopefully, I answered your question, Tom. Thomas Wadewitz : I guess, just to be clear, though, to the extent that you consolidate business differently with the train schedule than you did before, you don't have to change that as volume comes back. You can kind of keep that base and just run longer trains. Is that fair? Jim Vena : Yes, sir. In fact, our trains, this morning, I look at it every morning or we're running over 9,000 feet. So we might have ended up at 87,000. But business is coming back, and we're putting more of that business on the same trains that we add out there running. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : And I guess, Jim or Lance, to follow-up from that question or that response, it's maybe not quite intuitive to us as we look from the outside end at train length going higher, it necessarily equates to better service for the customer. So can you help us understand how these structural changes and cost outcomes and efficiency actually result in better customer outcomes, too? Lance Fritz : Yes. So let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Jim. One of the most astounding things to me, I've been with our railroad for 20 years now, and I was responsible for our operations for a bit of it. And if I look year-over-year, Jim mentioned this, our train starts -- the number of trains on our network at any given time are about 1/3 less, which is much more than what you see in volume. And how that translates into a service product is there's less network congestion on average anywhere you look, less meets passes, et cetera. So that allows each train, more free running time, and it really makes the network a little easier to dispatch, and that translates into a service product. Jim Vena : You bet. And how does a -- how do you -- does the customer look at it? Service that we sell and we provide is what we sold to the customer. So if we agree that we're going to move x amount of tons in a month or we need to run and we have a service product our intermodal service product, our premium product is as good as anybody. We come out of that West Coast headed towards Texas, and we get in there faster than anybody. So that's what we measure ourselves against.  What is it that the customer wants? They want reliability. They want consistency and they want to save on their assets. A lot of them own their cars. And if we can turn them faster for them and not just over the road, but we turn them faster within the yard and are -- we're over 90% on our first-mile last-mile being able to spot the cars when we said that we were going to be there to give them service. So the customer wins, now what the longer trains do, we're not going to run longer trains just to run longer trains. You want to be more productive, but you also have to build the schedule so that the railcars move from origin to destination. And I'll give you an example. Instead of running 5 trains between L.A. and Chicago, we run 3. We meet the schedules. We tell them what the engage is, and we build that in. Otherwise, I'll be honest, we could be running them even bigger if we did not take into account what the customer perspective was. But we're not done with that. I think -- and as we get closer -- I know this is a long answer, but this is important. As we get closer with the customer, we understand better and they understand what we can deliver, they'll work with us to say, when do you really need those containers when do you really need those railcars and there won't be as much buffer built into it and they trust that we're going to deliver, they'll be able to save even more costs on their side. So very excited about that. And that's the cool part about this is the time now, the next months as we transition into the next step of improving this place and making it the best operating railroad in North America. Long answer, I apologize, but I thought it was important to get it out. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Lance, a question on nearshoring. Can you help us understand what kind of conversations you're having with your customers on this topic? Is this something that they think is like real and imminent? Or is something that's in very early stages and kind of take years to play out? And how is that likely to impact Union Pacific, both in terms of maybe some headwinds in international intermodal, but maybe tailwinds in other domestic moves? Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you for the question, Ravi. So let me start, and I want Kenny to help me with some of the detail. Many of our customers are discouraged by the impact to their supply chains during the COVID pandemic. It started with a hard shutdown in parts of China that really impacted inbound onto the West Coast and ended up with the United States taking shutdowns that impacted other parts of the supply chain and then some disconnects between ourselves and U.S. MCA countries. So without a doubt, most of our customers on the margin are at least thinking about what to do in their supply chains. And some of them are talking about readjusting to bring some of that back nearshore.  It's early innings, so I can't really point to any substantial investment that's occurred at this point in time in terms of executing on that. But I do know there's planning in place. And the net effect for us is going to be maybe an impact on inbound intermodal imports. But candidly, I would -- I think I would prefer having that manufacturing occur nearshore, gives us better opportunity for inbound and outbound and typically in a part of our commodities that are a bit higher ARC. Kenny? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. Lance, you're exactly right. Ravi, thanks for the question. We haven't seen any customers make any really concrete bets yet on their shoring. I will tell you, we feel good about the service product and the interchange points that we have coming out of Mexico. The one thing that a number of folks have really harped on the day is our premium and our intermodal network. And what I'll tell you is that our manifest network, our carload network benefits from a stronger service product. And so a lot of these short-term, short-haul lanes we're able to compete in because we do have a lower cost structure, and the car velocity is much longer now. And so as you think about nearshore, it becomes more of a sweet spot for us and we'll be prepared for it if it comes on. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So I wanted to ask you, Jim, headcount's down about, I guess, 30% in 2 years. But that's -- if you look at it, it's pretty similar with other rails that have done PSR. And because volumes are down so much over that period, we haven't actually gotten much workforce productivity yet. So I guess my question is, do you think headcount needs to move up much at all as volumes are recovering here? Jim Vena : Well, Scott, you're a little bit like Walter, a tough marker. I thought we'd be pretty good when we dropped 32% in TE&Y in the quarter versus the drop in business. But I understand what you're saying. I think... Scott Group : Your slide says flat workforce productivity. Jim Vena : Yes. And that's the entire company, and you'll see it improve as the business comes back. The numerator at the top when you drop that kind of miles sort of hurts you. But I'm not here to argue about what the stat is. This is the way I see it. I think we can be more productive in the entire company and meaning that we need less people. And as we transition, we're not hiring, okay? The normal attrition rate that goes out is going to go out. So our plan is in operations and the rest of the company, that we are going to be more productive. And I think in operations, you will continue to see us be more productive in pieces that we haven't even tackled yet as much as we should on our engineering side. And we've done a lot of work on the mechanical side. We've done a lot of work on the operations side, on the transportation side, but I think there's more there.  And listen, I see the same numbers you, Scott. I would have loved that number to be with the big drop in business, not be flat. Flat was a pretty tough thing for us to do. But as the business comes back, we're going to have less people to run -- operate the railroad and be still safe and efficient. So I'm looking forward to it. Scott Group : Okay. And then, Jennifer, can I just ask you one real quick... Jennifer Hamann : I was going to say, you can ask the follow-up, but let me just reiterate. We have said, I think, pretty clearly, Jim said it and so did I, we won't bring people back on a one-for-one with the business levels. And we're already doing that today. Scott Group : Okay. Jennifer, I was just asking for any perspective on mix. So like yields of ex fuel have never been so bad this quarter. But last quarter, they were the best in 5 years. So the yields are obviously volatile quarter-to-quarter. Is there -- I know it's tough to forecast, but any thoughts on how to think about mix based on what you see so far in the third quarter? Jennifer Hamann : No. I mean, you're right. It is very tough to forecast. I mean, we've tried to give everyone a little bit more information on that with the RTM data that we're now providing. And so hopefully, that's helpful. But you guys know where our business is -- has the highest ARC. I mean, autos, as you've heard us reference already today, was really a big factor in yields and in the mix impact in the second quarter. Certainly, that has come back here. In the third quarter. And so we'll continue to watch that. We don't see crude oil coming back. That was another impact to mix. Sand has been a headwind for us as well, and that's another one that's probably not going to change. So keep those things in mind and then just watch how the rest of the business plays out. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : I just wanted to ask a quick question. There were some reports towards the end of June of equipment shortages on the West Coast because you are -- or the UP didn't have enough locomotives or cars in the context of kind of the surge of e-commerce volumes. I know those reports can sometimes not necessarily capture the whole story. So I wanted to ask you about it in terms of your readiness from an asset side to handle the sequential higher volumes.  And then I think, Kenny, I think you mentioned market share wins on the e-commerce side. I'm guessing that's with UPS. But I'm not sure, I'm sure you're not going to comment on that. But what hopefully you can comment on and just talk about as much as you can about the market share win and what the -- whether that's -- when we should see that? And what the context of that -- those wins were? Lance Fritz : Thanks for the question. No, we do not have an equipment shortage. We had we have cars parked in places. I went for a train ride, and we had cars parked in places that I never thought that I would ever see cars park. They were parked everywhere, ready to go, and we had them close on hand. Locomotives, we had locomotives, we have more locomotives stored than we have operating. So we could double the business and -- well, not quite, we could probably triple the business and use the locomotives that we got stored. So we have lots of locomotives. People-wise, we were real smart about it. And the return, when we call people back, the people are returning. It's in the low 90s that people are accepting to come back to work, which is fantastic. So we're not having to worry about having to retrain people, and we still have a lot of people furloughed. So given all that, what it is was some noise in 1 week, it's x, and then the next week, you want to do x plus 40% and somebody says, we're short of cars or short of people. Nobody can crank up our railroad running 2,000 different movements all over the place and in 1 week. So if somebody thought that was equipment shortage of people. The answer is no. It's just -- there was no way I was going to flow trains one way and have all the debt heads and extra costs. We took it on a systematic basis, and we're fluid now. The railroad is running smooth. And we're always going to have that a little bit of a lag. I mean that's the way to railroad. Somebody else might have done it differently. I would not have changed anything I did when we started back up and the business came back. Kenyatta Rocker : So thanks a lot for that question, Amit. I just want to talk about the network first and just say what the rail site in extensions, it's made us more reliable. I reflect on our lane, call it, Southern California into the East Coast or Southeast. It's just a sweet spot for us. We put more and more volume on there. We've opened up the pie. When I talk about making the pie larger, I'm talking about trucks. And so yes, we have aligned ourselves with a number of e-commerce winners. We've been able to win business in those markets. We feel very bullish about the wins. They are coming on now. We're expecting more. We see that those wins in the parcel in the domestic, and we've got a nice win on the international intermodal side. So I'll tell you, I haven't been as bullish about it as I am today, and we've got a great leader and Jason has leading up that area and Jim and his team are ready for it. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That sounds really great. For my follow-up question very quickly, Jennifer, based on the volume guidance for this year, you're obviously assuming just higher absolute revenue levels versus the second quarter, which is not really that far, right, given how bad the second quarter was. But like some other rails, you also took kind of the opportunity of COVID to really accelerate some of the structural cost reductions. So if you're getting several, several, several hundred million dollars more of revenue in the third quarter and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter, I just -- I'm not going to ask the incremental margin question because I know the answer I'm going to get. But the question I'm going to ask is just help us qualitatively think about what the incremental costs need to come back to service that? Are we just talking about higher absolute fuel and some car hire? Are we talking about more people? Like what needs to happen to service $600 million, $700 million more of revenue in the next quarter or this quarter, rather? Jennifer Hamann : Well, I think you kind of answered your own question there a little bit. I mean, again, we won't do things on a one-for-one basis. But at some point, you will need to add train starts as the volume grows, and there's people associated with that. There's locomotives, there's freight cars, car hire, and you're going to burn a little more fuel. So you're going to have all of those things we'll be part of it to move additional revenue. Our task and what we feel very confident about is that we will be able to do that in a more efficient way as the volumes come back, and we look forward to that because volume is definitely the friend of a railroad. So I think I'll leave it at that. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : This is one for Jim and Jennifer. Now that volumes are of the trough here, have you assessed the level of excess locomotives and cars on the network at this point? Can you rationalize that a bit. And in any significant way, are there leases to return, foreign cars to get rid of in more maintenance shops to consolidate?  And then I guess for Jennifer, when you go through that math, is it large enough to impair and dispose of them so you can pull out of group accounting and they'll get hit by those depreciation studies that we often see a couple of years down the road? Jim Vena : Well, listen, I appreciate it, Brian. Nice to talk to you this morning. At the end of the day, we've identified what's excess. We always want to keep a buffer so we work very close hand-in-hand with Jennifer and our old group to say, these are excess, what can you do about it? So I'll let Jennifer answer the next question. I think if there was people that wanted to purchase locomotives, if at the right price, we're not going to give them away. But at the right price, we would be more than willing to do that. Jennifer Hamann : Jennifer? Yes. I mean, I think we've had a bit of a for sale sign up for locomotives for a little while now, but there's not much of a market, particularly with the COVID impact of volumes. And then really the whole rail network going through similar activities with PSR. So we do look at what locomotives, we think are most likely to bring back into service and make adjustments as needed. That's kind of continual activity for the team. And if there's anything that we would do that is of a significant nature. We'd certainly talk to folks about it, but we feel pretty good where we're at right now. Lance Fritz : And it's not just the whole rationalization of the railroad, what we've been able to identify, in Chicago when we consolidate and at the end of the year, we're going to have our new facility -- expanded facility at G2 opened up, we have a facility at G1 that's pretty close to Downtown Chicago that becomes excess, property on the South side excess, property also in other locations. So all those are available that Jennifer and her team to go out there and see we can monetize and bring some more value to this company. So I'm very excited. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And it's latent capacity to grow into as well. Lance Fritz : Absolutely. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : So I wanted to ask about the volume guidance for a decline of 10% in 2020. Can you talk about what that assumes for the pace of the recovery in the back half of the year just generally? And then thinking about the quarterly cadence of volumes, even if it's just directionally, I mean, is your expectation that we could remain in this down double-digit range in the third quarter and then see an improvement in the fourth as the comp fees? Or is there any color around that quarterly cadence you can provide? Lance Fritz : Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. This is Lance. So our full year guidance of down 10%, if you do the math, that says the back half is going to be somewhere in the, call it, 9%, 10% down. How it breaks out quarter-to-quarter is something that is very difficult to estimate right now. Kenny has done a good job of sharing with you all the confidence he is growing and building as wins are starting to show up on the railroad. It's one thing to secure a domestic intermodal win in March. And then in the second quarter, nothing shipped. And now as retail is starting to restock, we'll start seeing some of those shipments occur. So it's a little bit difficult to parse it out exactly for you. So I won't attempt to do that. But your math broadly is right. In the second half, you're going to have to be in that down 9% or 10% to hit down 10%. And we're growing our optimism here in the near term. Justin Long : Okay. And just to clarify, that down 10%, is that a reference to RTMs or carloads? Lance Fritz : That's a volume number. That's a carload number. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison Landry : Jim, so I mean, clearly, it sounds like there's still a lot left to do in terms of reducing touch points and making structural changes to train design and just the overall network. But even with the changes that you've made so far, it would seem that you still haven't realized that the full margin benefit given the leap volumes for the last several quarters. So to the extent that the volume backdrop is cooperative in 2021 and maybe 2022, how quickly do you think you can get to the 55 long term OR target? Jim Vena : Well, Allison, I appreciate the question. We have a goal of 55, and you never hear me say a number on purpose because I'm just not -- I like to deliver it. But you -- structurally, you are absolutely correct. Kenny and his team bring the business back, which we see some wins, and we see some optimism from Kenny. We grow this company, which I think we can with the service product we have. I've just stay tuned. I think it's going to look pretty good. So I appreciate the question. Jennifer Hamann : I guess I can jump in here because... Jim Vena : All I said was stay tuned, okay? Jennifer Hamann : And you're spot on, Jim. I was just going to say, we need all 3 levers, and that's you've heard us say that very consistently we need Kenny and team to bring in the volume and the price. And then we've got the productivity that certainly, Jim and the operating group are responsible for a big portion of that, but it's a whole team effort in terms of driving productivity and building on that good service product. So it's all together. Jim Vena : Yes, Alison, I think she was worried I was going to use the word blow by. And I promised her I did, I was not going to use that today, okay? Lance Fritz : Not today. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Just to follow-up on that, Jim. A year, 1.5 years ish into the job now, clearly, you didn't have to go back to work. It seems you took this because you saw a tremendous opportunity at UP among other rails. When all is said and done and the world is back to some similar of normal, do you think UP has the potential to have the best operating margin returns or any other North American railroads? Or is the jury still out on that one? Jim Vena : Bascome, I appreciate it. You're absolutely right. I came because I thought it was a great company, great network, great group of people. And when Lance and I talked when I joined, the whole team wants to win. And I tell you, it's a great team. And it doesn't matter whether I'm here or not. I'll be honest. We're building it so we have strength in the long term. And yes, this railroad has the capability to be the best margin railroad in North America, lowest operating costs, bar none. So my job is to make sure that we get there and we deliver and have the right strength behind whenever I leave that the team -- they don't even miss me. In fact, they get better than when I was here, and I can watch them from my rocking chair when I'm 90 years old and enjoy it. Lance Fritz : Bascome, this is Lance. I'll bring us back to something we've historically talked about all the time, and that is we're building this better operating model, this service excellence, operational excellence on a franchise that's the best in the industry. We've got the wonderful Gulf Coast franchise. We've got Great East West corridors. We've got a great I-5 corridor. We service Mexico better and to a greater extent than anyone else in the industry. We are set for a very bright future. Bascome Majors : I appreciate that from both of you. Maybe to follow-up slightly on kind of the same thing. I know you've already been asked about a time line to 55. And I guess that's understandable. I think Rob rolled that out in 2016. So it's been out there for a while. But Lance, earlier this year, and clearly, a lot has changed since January. You suggested there might be some kind of investor event to sketch out kind of how you expect to get -- or where you expect to go over the next couple of years. Sometime later this year. Clearly, a lot has changed since then. But I'm curious, either Lance or Jim, when you think you might be in a position to kind of share what you're managing to over the next 2 to 3 years. Lance Fritz : Yes, that's a great question, Bascome. And you got it exactly right. I think it's opportune time to start talking to or have a concentrated moment where we speak to our investors about the game plan looking forward in a holistic way. And we would have loved to have done that this fall. That's just not going to work with COVID. So stay tuned. We haven't announced anything, but I would imagine it will be sometime in the first half of next year, presuming that we can do it safely and in a manner that protects everybody's health. Jennifer Hamann : Because we'd really like to do something like that in person and be able to get the team together. I think it's important for you all to see the UP team, the management team below who you normally talk to. And I think in person is the best way to do that. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : I trust you all or well. How are you thinking about sort of that post Labor Day peak season, especially as we've seen a much, much stronger July and a rebound, assuming that we don't have any more step backs in the reopening of our country? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And do you think it will be a strong enough environment to push through a PSS on surcharge? Lance Fritz : Ken? Kenyatta Rocker : Well, I'll start from the back first. I'd say premature right now to talk about a surcharge. Obviously, the demand is picking up. What I would tell you is that our volumes are really increasing each week. They're pretty strong. All the dynamics show that we're going to have a pretty solid peak season, the warehouses, warehouse inventory is normalized. So you don't have a lot of product in storage. E-commerce has been pretty strong. Retail has been improving sequentially each month. So it looks to me, barring any type of second wave that we're going to be in a really good position to have a really solid peak season. Jason Seidl : I just knocked on wood for you there. My follow-up question, Kenny, I'm going to stick with you here. I think you mentioned that some of the beer shipments were down in the quarter. We were hearing there was a lot of sort of out of stocks, if you will, heading into July 4. Is that fixing itself on the beverage side as we move to sort of the next beverage holiday, if you will, and Labor Day? Kenyatta Rocker : It is. Again, Jason, the run rate on our beer shipments are improving each week. What we saw in the second quarter was COVID-related downtime, production downtime, that's behind us now. And so we feel really good about those shipments heading into the holiday. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So I was wondering if I could direct this question to Jim. And Jim, if you could go back and draw a parallel, if it exists, between how you're operating versus your competitor, PSR railroad versus a non-PSR? And how similar that was when you were operating CN versus CP before Hunter? I mean, obviously, CN had some structural advantages from a cost perspective that allowed it to win in the marketplace, more often than not. Do you see the same parallel here with Burlington Northern? And do you notice that the PSR versus non-PSR effect, particularly when you're competing for new business? Jim Vena : Well, Walter, listen, that's a tricky question. I don't talk about how somebody else is operating. What I want to be able to do is operate -- be the best operator in the industry so we have a better chance to win. There are certain markets that are a competitor on a rail side is going to win because they have a better network in that piece and let them win that. And then we have a great network, and we're going to win. But bottom line is if you can have a lower cost structure, what it does is it opens you up for a new truck opportunity. It opens you up for more fluidity because the customer sees how you're able to move more product with less railcars for them. And you win on a head-to-head, and it gives you some pricing advantage in some areas. And Kenny has been real clear. We're all about making sure that we price ahead of what inflation is, rail cost inflation, and we're going to do that. So that's where you want to win. I think you win by having the most efficient railroad and you win in a number of lanes, not just one. Kenyatta Rocker : Let me add on to that -- this is Kenny, real quick. First of all, we've got a really strong competitor in the West. And a lot of respect there. Our commercial team is really focused on opening up new markets and making the pie larger, and we've talked about that a little bit on the call today, talked about a lot of the business that we're winning that short-haul business that in the past, because we didn't have the car velocity or the reliability or the lower cost structure, we weren't able to compete with the trucks on. And then I've also talked about a lot of these long-haul lanes that we're opening up the markets on. So our team focus is really on expanding the pie. And when I say that, I'm clearly looking at the truck markets. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. It appears we lost David's line. Our next question then will come from the line of John Chappell with Evercore. Jonathan Chappell : Good morning. As far as the average revenue per car is concerned, I mean, I understand the mix and the fuel surcharge. But if you look at these segment breakdown, there's some pretty big declines in like metals and coal and obviously food and refrigerated. So just as we think about the 10% carload guidance for the full year, in 1Q, revenue was better by 400 basis points versus carloads and 2Q, it was worse by 400 basis points. How do we think about the revenue versus the carload in the second half of the year with that 10% carload guidance? Jim Vena : Yes. So let's talk a little bit more broadly. And then Jennifer, I'll bring it down to you for specific commentary on the guidance he's looking for. John, when we're thinking about the volume looking forward, there's still going to be weak spots for us. Kenny mentioned them. Frac sand is likely still to be weak. Coal is -- who knows what it will do, but it's not terribly strong. You probably got some weakness in some of the industrial products, areas that are oriented towards shale-related plays. But absent those, setting them aside, most everything else should be showing improvement certainly from the second quarter. And so when you think about it like that and you first and foremost take automotive, finished vehicles, high ARC business off the table is a substantial headwind, the big headwinds really come off the table. There's still a little bit of headwind in frac sand, maybe a few others. But to that point, there's tailwinds that are going to start showing up like in automotive. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, so when you're talking about ARC, obviously, that's going to be driven by the business mix. And when you look at -- I'll take it up a step from where you were talking to it, through our 3 groups. You've got industrial, that is our highest ARC business. And then you've got the bulk, which is next and then the premium, which has the lowest ARC. And so if you think about it just in terms of kind of those broad segments, you're hearing us talk about being able to drive significant growth on the premium side of the business. Autos is just part of that. And then the industrial piece, that's where we're still seeing negative industrial production forecast for third quarter. So I would think about it in kind of those broad economic things. And don't forget about fuel. Obviously, fuel surcharge is part of ARC fuel prices were significantly a part of the impact there in terms of the second quarter. And we're not looking for fuel prices to increase or really change dramatically going from 2Q to 3Q. So that year-over-year impact is going to be there as well. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Just want to get a little bit dirty and talk about coal. Is it 50% lower from here in a few years? Is there a scenario you can see where it's higher? How do you structurally think about the coal business? And anything that you can do to mitigate the slide that we've seen? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. It's -- we're going to have challenges here in the near term and long term. It's in structural decline. Obviously, there are some ins and outs with what happens with low natural gas. We're staying very close to our customers and make sure we can stay competitive with them, with each deal that comes up. But overall, we're just trying to backfill where we can because we do know that over time, it's going to continue to leak. David Ross : And no scenario where it doesn't leak? Kenyatta Rocker : We don't see that. I think there is a scenario where we try to slow down the slope so that it's not a steep slope. But I -- we'd expect that it will continue to just gradually decline. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Sorry about that, the joys of work from home and muted lines. So Lance, I wanted to ask you a question about big picture returns. If you look at the last couple of years, you guys have done a great job offsetting the headwinds from asset turnover through the margin expansion and a lower tax rate to kind of stabilize the return profile of the business. As we look ahead, what can you guys do to kind of fix that revenue asset turnover question?  And we talk a lot about service getting better and taking revenue from truck. Is that going to be enough to get the asset turnover moving in the right direction as you kind of get to whatever stable level are you're going to be at? Lance Fritz : Yes, it's a great question, David. And I'll start by saying, we do believe that the new service product, the lower cost structure, opening up markets to us and Kenny's commercial team putting more of their posture on their front foot from a sales and business development perspective, all of that combines to definitely give us a better opportunity to get asset utilization up. I feel pretty good about that. I think there's plenty of opportunity. I look at our served markets, which are very broad. We touch a lot of the economy. And absent this immediate COVID impact and the behavioral changes that are in the near term, over the longer term, I think the argument for the United States and for North America is still pretty darn strong. That doesn't mean we're not looking at other things. We're always looking at ways to be more important to our customers, to serve them better, to play a different role in the supply chain, if it makes sense. But I think our core business has a really good opportunity to continue generating both good margin and good ROIC. David Vernon : Do you think you need to kind of invest more in some of that collaborative supply chain kind of resource within the company to unlock that potential? Or do you think you've got the right level of kind of commercial focus on that? I know if you look back and look at CN's transition from the Hunter's way or highway to the [indiscernible] world of [indiscernible], is that something that is in the path for the company? Is that something you think you're going to be putting some effort into in the coming years? Lance Fritz : I think what we're focused on is making sure Kenny has got the right culture and team members so that business development happens at the pace and magnitude that we think we should be capable of I believe we're in process there. That might take some investments, and we've talked a little bit about it, and there are small cost investment, large impact, like Salesforce, Pros as a pricing tool, tableau is a analytical tool, others. We talk about our APIs and making customers see more value and be stickier with us, and that's a manifestation of our net control investment. We talk about product development and making sure that we're doing what we need to do to serve the parts of the market that are now open to us.  But in addition to that, kind of getting at your question, I wouldn't be surprised if there are other investments we make that look more like the activity Loop does, where you're providing ancillary services from the railroad, but they are primary services to a customer. And it makes us a more valuable supplier, it makes us stickier and opens up even more markets for us.  I think you're definitely onto something there, David. And it will be part of the conversation we talk about when we're at a moment in time having an Analyst Day. Operator : We have time for one additional question, which is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : A question is to intermodal question. With all the service improvements that you've made in intermodal and trip plan compliance going up, do you think the gap required to really accelerate truck conversions, the price gap between rail and truck has narrowed? And what do you think the gap needs to be to really push the truck conversion thesis forward? Kenyatta Rocker : Yes. Thanks a lot, Jordan. First of all, we're nowhere near the levels that we enjoy in 2018, the back half of 2018, where there were some pretty large gaps. When we look at the forecast, we certainly expect that the truck utilization and those rates will improve monthly well into 2021, which will put us in a better position to not only win more business, but get a little bit more margin on that business. Having said that, we certainly aren't waiting around for something to happen. We're going after it right now. We feel good about the wins that we've made that we know will show up here in the near term. And it's broadly across the intermodal network. It's not just the international, it's not just the domestic, it's pretty broad, it's is the parcel also. So we feel like we're capturing those wins right now, and we're excited to see them come on and onboard over the next several weeks. And we expect to continue to grab more share. Lance Fritz : Jordan, let me put a little exclamation point on that for Kenny. So during the past domestic intermodal bid season, which happened at, call it, starting late last year, but really at the heart of it was April, March, February this year, a little bit of May, that's right in the heart of the worst decline in volumes across the network, not just us but trucks. So trucks were loose, pricing was tough. In that environment, Kenny's team grew share of wins. Now it didn't ship. It's starting to ship now. That's why Kenny is confident in the manner is on our domestic intermodal product. But for me, that's a proof statement that we don't have to wait for the gap between rail and truck to get better. Our service product, our ability to price and earn a margin in today's environment is such where we have an ability to penetrate against truck right now. Operator : At this time, I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : And thank you, Rob, again, and thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning on our call. We look forward to talking with you again in October to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. Until then, I wish you all good health. Take care and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : And thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today in Omaha are Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, Chief Financial Officer. As I'm sure, you all saw on Tuesday, we announced a transition that will take place in our operating department. Jim Vena will be transitioning his responsibilities over to Eric Gehringer at the beginning of the year, while staying on until the end of June as a senior adviser. I'm excited to have Eric lead our operating department into the future. Eric has a track record of success at our company and will push the team to continue to think boldly as we pursue operational excellence. I want to express my deep appreciation to Jim for the leadership he brought to Union Pacific. Jim accomplished everything I could have hoped for and more. He brought a level of expertise and speed of decision-making that has been critical to our transformation. I'm very pleased that he's going to continue working closely with Eric and the rest of the team over the next several months to guide us through a smooth transition. while seeing some key projects to completion. Thank you very much. Jim. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to acknowledge the work of our dedicated employees. As we continue to operate our railroad through the pandemic, the women and men of Union Pacific are doing an excellent job keeping themselves and their families safe. As a result, they are able to provide our customers with a service product that is fluid and uninterrupted. Our rail network continues to operate at a very high level, reflecting the talent, commitment, and resilience of our Union Pacific team. Moving to third quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2020 third quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.01 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $2.22 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 58.7% an all-time quarterly record and an 80 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2019, despite moving 4% fewer carloads. Our third quarter results represent another step in our company's transformation. We demonstrated our ability to adjust to a sharp rebound in volume, while continuing to provide a safe, efficient and reliable service product to our customers. The results we are delivering both operationally and financially deepen our conviction that the changes we're making to transform our railroad are on track and on target. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide an operations update. Jim Vena : Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We had an impressive quarter to turn in the results you see today. We had to watch our asset utilization closely as we dealt with a sharp volume increase following the equally sharp volume decline of the second quarter, as we continue to navigate the pandemic. And we have had some significant weather events in this quarter as well. In the face of those challenges, the team delivered strong productivity gains to the tune of $205 million and a total of $610 million year-to-date, all in all a very strong quarter for the entire operating team. Turning to slide 4, I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators. Driven by the team's relentless focus on asset utilization and reducing car touches, freight car velocity and freight car terminal dwell both improved 3%. These improvements along with increased train length, which we'll talk more about on the next slide demonstrate how our operating model is striking the right balance between service and efficiency. We continue to adjust our transportation plan to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives. In the third quarter, we achieved a quarterly record in locomotive productivity, an 11% improvement versus last year, which is all the more impressive when you consider the mix challenge of trading coal and sand volumes for intermodal volumes. Workforce productivity also a quarterly record improved 13% from third quarter 2019. Productivity improvements were led by the train and engine workforce down 22% versus last year, which significantly outpace the 4% volume decline. Our manifest service remained strong during the quarter driving a 5-point improvement in trip plant compliance for manifest and autos. Intermodal trip plant compliance decreased in the quarter, reflecting the impact seen across the entire intermodal supply chain from the sharp West Coast volume increase. Although, we positioned the equipment near the L.A. Basin in anticipation of a surge the resulting imbalances following the first wave of the freight as well as the sharp uptick in demand for both TE&Y and terminal employees took a few weeks to work through the network. But the team responded quickly with resources and transportation plan changes, enabling us to exit the quarter with intermodal trip plan compliance back in the low to mid-80s. Our results have been strong this year, and we expect to see continued improvement in the fourth quarter. Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. Our focus on increasing train length and handling traffic efficiently remains strong. We were able to absorb the majority of the sequential volume increase by adding traffic to our existing train network. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, when we first began implementing our version of precision scheduled railroading we have increased train length across our system by 28% or 1950 feet to approximately 9,000 feet in third quarter of 2020. We've completed 28 15,000-foot sidings through the third quarter allowing longer trains to run in both directions and reduced the number of train starts. We plan to have another eight sidings completed by the end of 2020. We recently curtailed operations at the East Hump in our North Platte Nebraska yard. This location was unique in that, it previously had two humps. Going forward, the cars will either be processed at the still active west hump or flat switched. The redesign of our operations in Chicago and Houston remains on track. Chicago intermodal consolidation is set to be complete by year-end. We are also making progress in Houston to consolidate our intermodal facilities into one location to expand, switching capability and improve our ability to run longer trains out of the Inglewood yard. Finally, we continue to make organizational changes to better align resources and responsibilities. During the quarter, we took an additional workforce reduction in the operating department and also integrated intermodal operations into the transportation department. We will continue to seek efficiency in all facets of what we do and there remain many more opportunities ahead of us. To wrap-up, we remain committed to protecting our employee's health and safety and providing strong service to our customers. We will continue to make structural changes to improve operational performance and efficiency. The changes we're making in Chicago and Houston will drive continued improvements in our intermodal service product allowing us to be more competitive in those markets. We have made great progress in transforming our operations to this point. Our focus is unwavering, as we will continue to improve safety service asset utilization and network efficiency in order to provide customers with a service product that is competitive and provides value. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I want to make a few comments on Tuesday's announcement. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished during my time at Union Pacific. Really the results speak for themselves. We've got the leadership team and culture and a great place to continue to flourish and Eric is the right person to lead the team. He's a very talented railroader and brings a great skill set to the position. I know he'll continue to challenge the team to be relentless in their pursuit of efficiency. I'm going to stick around for a bit longer to make sure the transition is smooth and some key projects are completed. I'm very confident that this team won't back off on the progress we've made or making to produce an industry-best product for our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jim and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was down 4%, primarily due to declines in our industrial and bulk business groups. The decrease in volume coupled with a 7% decline in average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 11% in the quarter. Weak economic conditions related to the pandemic continue to impact multiple market segments but it was partially offset by stronger demand in the premium group. So, let's take a closer look at how the third quarter performed for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 9% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 21% as a result of weaker market conditions from low natural gas prices and soft export demand. Volume for grain and grain products was up 3% from an increased demand of export grain partially offset by pandemic-reduced demand for ethanol. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 4% due to the stronger export potash, slightly offset by lower production of phosphate rock. Finally, food and refrigerated volume was flat and strong beverage shipments were offset by softer food service and restaurant demand. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue declined 18% from a 16% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 2% due to a lower fuel surcharge and negative mix. Energy and specialized shipments decreased 20%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices coupled with weak demand. Forest products volume was flat. Growth in lumber shipment from improved housing starts and repair and remodels offset declines in paper shipments. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments declined by 9% due to the pandemic-related impacts on both global and domestic demand. Industrial chemicals volume had the largest reduction as these carloads are closely tied to industrial production. Metals and minerals volumes decreased by 22% due to reduced sand shipments associated with the decline in oil prices and a surplus in local sand. Rock shipments were also reduced due to the pandemic-related impact on demand and project delays. Turning now to premium, revenue for the quarter was down 1% on a 5% increase in volume. Average revenue per car declined by 6%, reflecting a lower mix from increased intermodal shipments. Automotive volume was down 9% for the quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, most North American manufacturing plants have resumed production, but our run rates were about 15% below 2019. Production volumes steadily increased throughout the third quarter as dealers restocked inventory. Intermodal volume decreased by 9% year-over-year driven by strength in domestic truckload and parcel shipments as well as onboarding new international business. Despite the pandemic, sales for most retailers increased throughout the quarter. And not only did we see the footprint of e-commerce sales of total U.S. retail sales grow year-over-year, but more importantly, we saw our volume increase as a result of key business wins. As we enter the fourth quarter, you can see on slide 11 that our overall volume is currently up 4% year-over-year. Based on these run rates we'd expect year-over-year fourth quarter volumes to be up low single-digit. We expect premium volumes to remain strong similar to current run rates for the remainder of the year. Strength in e-commerce is likely to continue and volumes will be bolstered by inventory restocking as we enter peak holiday shopping season coupled with recent business development wins. For bulk, the coal market remains challenged as high inventory and weather conditions continue to be factors. However, we have a positive outlook for export grain due to China's continued purchases. Additionally, we expect to see continued strength in beer shipments and we could see modest growth in our food and refrigerated line if food service and restaurant demand improve. And lastly, for industrial, the potential for crew by rail remains largely uncertain. If oil prices remain depressed, then we anticipate continued year-over-year declines. But on a positive note, we are anticipating slow sequential quarterly improvements for most of our other markets. The outlook for housing starts remain positive and our improved service product is opening up new markets for us like some short-haul business that wouldn't have been so attractive to us in the past. This is just one example of how we're staying focused on things we can control. The team has done a fabulous job executing on our marketing initiatives to win new business and as Jim stated earlier, our service product continues to improve, which helps our customers compete in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk about our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thank you, Kenny and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier, Union Pacific is reporting third quarter earnings per share of $2.01 and a quarterly operating ratio of 58.7% an all-time quarterly record and our first sub-59 quarter. Looking at our quarterly income statement, operating revenue totaled $4.9 billion down 11% versus last year on a 4% year-over-year volume decline demonstrating our consistent ability to adjust cost with volume, operating expense decreased 12% to $2.9 billion. Taken together we are reporting third quarter operating income of $2 billion, a 9% decrease versus 2019. Other income of $37 million was down $16 million versus last year as a result of lower interest income as well as less rental income. Interest expense increased 11% due to increased debt levels and costs associated with our recent debt exchange. Income tax expense was lower, down 12% as a result of lower pretax quarterly income. Net income of $1.4 billion, declined 12% versus last year, which combined with share repurchases led to a 9% decrease in earnings per share to $2.01. As I just mentioned, our 58.7% operating ratio was 80 basis points better year-over-year. Lower fuel prices had a 100 basis point positive impact on the operating ratio while fuel surcharge lag negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.03. Turning now to slide 14, which provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, totaling $4.6 billion, down 11% versus 2019. The primary contributor to the year-over-year decline was a 4% decrease in carloadings, a substantial improvement from the second quarter, but still in negative territory. Lower diesel fuel prices, down 35% year-over-year impacted revenue by 3.5 points. Positive, core pricing gains were more than offset by our business mix, reducing revenue 3.25 points. Although we continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation, revenues were impacted by moving more business at a lower average revenue per car, something we commonly refer to as negative mix. A 9% increase in intermodal combined with industrial volume declines, which included the continued falloff in sand and crude carloads were strong contributors to that negative mix. Now let's move on to slide 15, which provides a summary of our third quarter operating expenses. As you heard Jim discuss, we did a great job operationally in the quarter adjusting to that sharp rebound in traffic. And at the same time, we're very effective controlling costs. If you look at the individual expense lines, comp and benefits expense decreased 11% year-over-year, as we offset wage inflation and higher severance cost through lower force counts. Third quarter workforce levels declined 18% or about 6,500 full-time equivalents versus last year, while sequentially increasing by fewer than 100. Our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 22%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 14% with a portion of those reductions related to fewer capital employees. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 40% as a result of the significantly lower diesel fuel prices and lower volumes. Third quarter consumption rate increased slightly versus 2019, reflecting the mix impact of running fewer heavy-haul bulk shipments. Purchased services and materials expense declined 11% in the quarter, as we continue to use our locomotive fleet more productively. In addition, our loop subsidiary incurred less drayage expense versus last year with fewer auto shipments. Equipment and other rents fell 8% in the quarter despite mix pressure in this category related to increased intermodal shipments. However, freight car and locomotive productivity efforts more than offset that headwind, driving car hire savings and lower lease expense. Other expense was our only cost category that increased year-over-year, up 8% in the quarter, driven by $17 million of higher state and local taxes. We still expect this cost category to be up around 5% on a full year basis, in line with prior guidance. Looking now at productivity. As discussed during our second quarter call, the game plan was to leverage sequential volumes against our smaller cost structure, while maintaining a high level of service. And based on our results, I'd say we did just that. We continued our trend of generating strong net productivity, with the third quarter coming in at $205 million. The operating department's continued progress on train length initiatives, balanced with an improved service product and more efficient use of our workforce and locomotives, led those productivity gains. In addition, all areas of the company continue to control spending, as well as look for ways to do more with less. Our year-to-date net productivity of $610 million already exceeds both our expectations for 2020, as well as the impressive $590 million of net productivity, we achieved for the full year 2019. As we look to the fourth quarter, understanding that we do have a difficult comparison against last year's fourth quarter, we now expect full year 2020 net productivity to exceed $700 million or $1.3 billion over the last two years. This strong productivity is evident in our record quarterly operating ratio of 58.7%. Using the same barometer as past quarters for evaluating cost variability, year-over-year third quarter expenses were 180% volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis. Sequentially, as third quarter volumes increased 19% from the second quarter, fuel adjusted operating expenses only increased 11%. Moving on to cash and liquidity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Union Pacific has been in a position of strength with our cash generation liquidity and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash from operations decreased only 4% versus 2019 to $6 billion despite a 12% decrease in net income. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $3.7 billion, resulting in a 93% cash conversion rate. After payment of our industry-leading quarterly dividend, cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $2.6 billion. As volumes have remained relatively steady in the 160,000 seven-day carloading range, we are moving to redeploy some of that cash. We resume share repurchases in early October and announced our plans for a $500 million par call on debt due in early 2021. We also plan to pay off an additional $300 million of incremental debt we assumed earlier this year for added liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, as we continue to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. As we've said before, navigating through this pandemic has reinforced our conviction that maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating is critical and is an essential element to our commitment to provide strong cash returns to our owners, which totaled nearly $5 billion at the end of September. Turning now to our outlook. You heard Kenny talk about the positive drivers we see in the marketplace and our expectation that fourth quarter volumes will be our first quarter with positive year-over-year growth in two years. Given this improved outlook, we now expect full year volumes to be down 7% or so. As I pointed out earlier, we expect productivity to exceed $700 million for full year 2020, and our long-standing pricing guidance is unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. We are committed to making sure each piece of business we move is earning an adequate return and that we are being compensated for the value we are delivering in the marketplace. Our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce a record 2020 operating ratio. In fact, we now expect the full year 2020 operating ratio to improve by roughly one point and start with a five. While the course we've charted in 2020 is certainly much different than expected when we laid out our original targets being able to achieve a sub-60 operating ratio in the heart of a pandemic is an impressive accomplishment for the entire Union Pacific team. In terms of cash generation and capital allocation, full year capital expenditures are still projected to come in around $2.9 billion, as we make good progress on our renewal and productivity investments. We will continue providing strong cash returns to our owners through our dividend and share repurchases. And longer-term, capital expenditures remain projected to be below 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and ultimately achieving that 55% operating ratio remains a vision and objective for our company. Wrapping up, I'd like to express my appreciation to our exceptional employees, the job they've done this year to work safely, stay nimble and provide a quality service product for our customers while also improving productivity is truly remarkable. Our goal of operating the safest most efficient and most reliable railroad in North America is clearly achievable knowing we have the best people in the business. With that I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. Our first priority has been and will always be safety. We have a continuous focus on improvement and I'm confident the team has the right plan and is taking the right actions to make Union Pacific a safer railroad going forward. Our service and financial results demonstrate the transformation of our company. We are a more efficient and a more reliable railroad that is driving value for our customers on the way to achieving operational excellence. Our enhanced service product coupled with a lower cost structure and innovative new services is opening up new markets and opportunities with our customers. And as you heard from Kenny today the team is winning by converting more business to rail our customers are reducing their carbon footprint to the tune of an estimated 16 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions so far this year as we move together toward a more sustainable future. Our optimism for the future has never been greater as Union Pacific is well positioned for a future of long-term growth and excellent returns. So with that let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Great, good morning. And Jim great job over the last few years and good luck in the future. Maybe for Lance or Jim I guess just starting off. Keeping your employees down 18% with volumes accelerating a great job in the quarter and great job in the OR but you saw some intermodal struggles as you mentioned. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the incremental margins going forward and your thought on the pace of expense returns as you move into 2021, just given Jen just talked about the kind of inflection into positive volumes for the first time in a while? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Jim you want to talk about the expense side and then we'll convert it to the go-forward margins? Jim Vena : Okay. So thanks Ken. I appreciate the question and thanks for saying a good two years not quite two years, but we've got a little bit of work left to do. So I'm looking forward to the next few months to really get this place going even better. So, on the intermodal and the expense side, I think we showed in the quarter how we can handle the business and be smart about how we handle the business. It is -- if we need to win we need to be able to look at things on a full supply chain view and that's what we did. And everybody knew that you cannot easily react without really disrupting the entire network when it comes to the intermodal volume that increased substantially. But I think the speed that we reacted and where our metrics are after was a great move. The expense will continue on a unit basis to be less purely because of the capital investments we've made in the network and the efficiency. We turn our locomotives way quicker, we turn our crews quicker, we turn our cars quicker, we handle the inspections quicker. We do so many things faster that we'll continue to build on that. So I don't see -- whatever business comes on I think we still will be able to improve our efficiency across the board. Lance Fritz : Yes and building up that Ken from an incremental margin or go forward margin perspective, of course we continue to expect that we're going to improve our margins. The capital investments that Jim just outlined are going to be a support. And we're also looking with Kenny's team at an end-to-end view of our intermodal product, whether it's international intermodal or domestic intermodal. And those both give us an opportunity to margin up whether it's by efficiency in the chain or an opportunity for better pricing. Ken Hoexter : Thanks Lance, thanks Jim. Lance Fritz : Thanks Ken. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Good morning. Jim I'll echo the congrats and wanted to ask about the announced transition. I think a lot of investors are wondering if this means the heavy lifting on PSR and productivity gains is complete. So could you just address that? Do you disagree with that view? And if so, can you talk about why now is the right time to make this transition versus sticking around for another year or 2? Jim Vena : Okay. Well listen I appreciate the question. So let me take it back to when I came on at Union Pacific. Lance and I sat down and we talked about what we needed to do and how I could help the team and -- at UP to drive the productivity that they already had in mind. It wasn't -- I think everybody in Union Pacific realized that listen there's an opportunity to become more efficient and be able to have a great service product and win in the marketplace. So those goals were there. And I was really -- it was refreshing to hear Lance and Rob we were all in the same room together talk about how we wanted to become the leader in the industry when it came to efficiency, operational efficiency and service excellence. So you build on that. I committed when I came on the 18 to 24 months. I could have stayed longer. I could have stayed shorter. There was nothing that was tying me into the company. But my job was to build the foundation of operational group that understood what was possible and what we could deliver. And I think that's what I've done. And I'm very comfortable that Eric is the right person to lead it. Let's just put this right down to is he Jim Vena? No he's not Jim Vena. And I'm not -- if you compare me to some of the other people that have led companies operationally, I'm not the same person. I think we've done a great job of not causing a lot of pain to our customers. In other situations people have done that. So we've been measured. Eric is the right guy. He's got the right background. He's got the right skill level. I like the way his mind works. He sees things quick. So I'm very confident that we've got that right. But below that and I'm disappointed in that we -- because of COVID we could not get everybody into CR team operationally whether it's Tom in the North or David Giandinoto in the South or John Turner very bright person, okay, or it's Hunt Cary. We've got a team of railroaders. And as you all know I've been railroading for a while that I'm very confident they understand what we're doing and they will deliver. Now I'm going to be around and I'll be honest if they make a slip up. I don't care whether I'm gone or not I will be phoning them okay? And asking them what the heck they're doing and I'll keep the heat on it. The worst thing we can do and the true measure of a leader is that, when you depart the team understands what's supposed to happen and you go out there and deliver. Two more points on that. One is, is I spent a lot of time with people at different levels in the company. And I've spent probably 20 days in the last three months putting on sessions with frontline supervisors that try to drive the decision-making have the right culture. And I'll continue to do that till the end of the year and some into the New Year. So I'm very confident that we've got the right team. And let me answer that last piece. What's left? Well, locomotives are going to be way more productive. Our train length, I see 10,000 feet, okay? I see our car freight velocity up another 5% or 10%. So I think that we are just starting. The mechanisms, the measures, the culture is all there to succeed. And I am not worried about it. And I am going to keep my Union Pacific stock. I'm not going to go out there and sell it because I'm very confident that we're going to do the right thing. So Justin, I hope -- a long answer and I apologize, but I just wanted to make sure I put it all on the table. Justin Long : That's very helpful. Very helpful insights. I appreciate the time. Jim Vena : Thanks, Justin. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, congratulations on the last, I guess, sub two years. Maybe one more for you before you head out into the new role and keeping an eye on things from afar. Look at all the buckets of productivity and the success you've had including this quarter, it is slowing down a little bit, but one area where we haven't seen as much improvement is really on fuel economy. You've got record train lengths that are going up. You've got locomotive productivity that's at all-time high newer fleets. So I know mix is an issue grade and topography is an issue, but some of your peers have been able to move the needle a bit more on that front and we haven't quite seen that yet from UP, in fact, going up a little bit in terms of consumption this quarter. So maybe you can help conceptualize or even quantify what that opportunity looks like? And if that's one of the big buckets you see left for the team as you step more into an advisory role? Thank you. Jim Vena : So let me answer it backwards. Yes, it's a bucket that we see and it is a substantial bucket on an expense side that we think that we've got the right plan in. The number you see if you peel back the mix issue, this last quarter we had over 4% improvement in our fuel use on a GTM basis if you look underneath. Now that's masked with the change in the type of trains that we're running and the volume, but I'm very comfortable that we have the right process in place that we continue to drop. I don't think we're going to get 4% every quarter. But the best way to look at it is -- is if we put more on the same number of trains, with the same number of locomotives that we had before and that's what we're doing on an average number of horsepower per train and we're able to build the trains to what our capacity is we will continue to see that fuel productivity number improve. Are we going to be the best in the industry? No. There's some advantages for railroad I used to work at. Their mainline grade is pretty -- is weighed at about half of ours. So we're going to burn a little more fuel to get over some of those mountains getting out to the West Coast. But at the end of the day, we have a lot of advantages on how we can turn and use the fuel and we've spent money on technology, continue to -- so that the locomotives and the -- locomotive engineers are better at understanding how they operate and I see us continuing to get that. The mix turns -- Eric is probably going to get maybe a mix turn down the road and everybody will say he's brilliant on saving the fuel. So -- so I'm very comfortable. Brian Ossenbeck : I have actually -- have that one. All right. Thanks, Jim. Jim Vena : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. So just thinking about the fact that volumes are recovering in addition to the higher productivity gains that you're now looking for this year. Just as you think forward, would you expect to see a step function improvement in the OR in 2021 as volumes allow you to more fully realize the benefits of PSR? So maybe just some thoughts on that. I can appreciate you're not giving next year's guidance, but also if you could quickly address at what point do you think you can achieve the 55% OR? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yes, I'll start and ask Jennifer to back me up Allison. This is Lance. Good morning. So the moving parts as we look into next year, we do expect volumes to be better. Of course, it won't be hard to do that against the pandemic. And it's hard for us to gauge exactly how much better. But that will be a help. Productivity is going to continue. That will be a help. We haven't nailed down that target, but it's going to be healthy. And we've got plenty of initiatives moving into next year that we'll keep a shoulder into. Mix is a real big question mark. I don't see much reason to change our current mix experience until the industrial economy really starts recovering a little bit quicker and with more strength than we've seen so far post our trough in May. So that's the biggest question mark, I think, that will dictate just how much margin improvement we are able to attain next year. Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Allison thanks for the question. You've heard us say many times the drivers of our performance are what Lance just laid out its volume, productivity and then the price piece. So we're encouraged by what you're seeing in the truck markets today and with the service product that we've got out there and all the work that Kenny and his team are doing. But we're still working through our plans for 2021, but we have every expectation that we've got a great road map ahead of us where we can continue to improve. We'll give you obviously more detail around that when we talk to you in January. And our hope is sometime next year we should be able to gather everyone as we were hoping to do in the fall of this year and with a little more certainty on what's going on with the economy and the pandemic be able to lay out for you guys kind of a multiyear plan that we see for ourselves and how we look to continue to make improvement and go to the 55% OR. Allison Landry : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yes. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, Lance and Jim. Jim, congratulations on the retirement 2.0 there. I'm still looking -- wondering when it was going to come. Jim Vena : Thank you. Jason Seidl : I want to concentrate everyone a little bit on mix on intermodal because clearly the surge to the West Coast has been somewhat aided by restocking efforts that are likely to continue at least in the near future, but at some point that will abate. So how should we think about the mix between international business and more domestic business for 2021 and the impacts on the arc? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So thanks for that question, Jason. First of all, I would just say that controlling what we can't control we're going to go out there and win as much business as we can in all those markets. And this year we've been able to do that. We've been able to grow our e-commerce business. We've got a great service product that Jim and the team has provided us. On the international side, we talked about an international win. And even on our domestic truckload side, we've been able to go out there and win new business. We have seen a little bit more of our international business transloaded into some of the West Coast ports. That just means that we have to compete on the domestic side, which I've said, we've been able to do. So regardless of how that product comes in, we've inserted a lot of technology with our customers to go out and win business, whether it's APIs that see the business coming from Asia, whether it's our ITR business to give great visibility to our customers on when their business will move. We feel like we've got a really strong domestic product to go out there and compete. And we've also won quite a bit on the international side. Jason Seidl : Right. But Kenny, if it does slow down, should we expect a change in the arc for 2021 on the restocking side? Jennifer Hamann : What specifically slows down Jason? Jason Seidl : So the restocking efforts that we've seen in all the massive surge that West Coast supports lately. Lance Fritz : Yes. So, Jason, this is Lance. I get what you're asking. So part of what we're seeing in domestic strength is a restocking, because we can see that in the data as well, right? Inventory is relatively down. Sales are up and the inventory sales ratio is below where I think retailers traditionally would like it to be. So as we look into next year, some amount of that destocking probably drops off a bit. It's hard to say just exactly what happens in impact on mix and overall arc as that's occurring. One thing that is likely to occur as we go into next year would be, the surcharges dropping off in the L.A. Basin and up in the PNW, but those are really asterisks right now in terms of the overall yield that we're reporting. They're helpful, but very marginal. Kenny Rocker : Yes. The only thing I'll add to that is, if you look at the data, the retail sales have actually improved sequentially. So there is a pull element to the demand. And the inventory that they sit today, they're lower than they were in 2019. So they're still lower inventory. And then you think about that e-commerce business, I believe that there is a structural change out there with the consumer preference that there's going to be more e-commerce there that fits very nicely with our service product. Lance Fritz : And that parcel business is very attractive to us. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, we're just starting to get into the bid season for next year, Jason. And I think maybe that's part of your question too, in terms of if that truck market stays tight, we think that's a great opportunity for us, particularly with the service product that we've got to offer right now. Jason Seidl : Okay. Well, looks fantastic. I appreciate the time, as always, everyone. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you, Jason. Jennifer Hamann : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. Lance, I guess, in response to a previous question about intermodal, you said we're going to look to margin up in the future. But it's interesting here, because if I look north of the border since you guys peaked on volumes, go back more than a decade, we've seen greater than like 80% expansion in intermodal volume on the Canadian networks, or at least one of your competitors. It's been roughly flat for you guys over that same time period. And I know you've gone through a lot of mix shift in the network, but what can you tell your investors? Is the strategy here to continue to focus on margin above growth? I keep hearing you guys talk about a service product that's competitive, is now the time to focus a lot more on top line? And what strategies can you take? Can you be more proactive at the ports, because we've definitely seen a shift from U.S. West Coast up North to Canada? Lance Fritz : Yes, Brandon. Thank you and that's a great series of questions. So the fundamental difference today versus 10 years ago is our service product is much, much better. It's much more reliable. We're actually doing what we say we're going to do. And we can see that very clearly in our KPIs when we break out the premium, the intermodal and automotive car trip plan compliance. And over 10 years that metric has actually gotten harder to achieve. So we're measuring ourselves through a harder metric and it's much higher in terms of absolute performance. Customers experience that. So the item number one is, we're positioned to be able to win business. Item number two is, we are not monolithic in terms of our focus. We want to grow. We know that growth volume is going to be a really important lever, as we continue to improve our operating ratio going forward and so is price and so is efficiency. And we think we can achieve all at the same time. And item number three, Brandon, a little bit of a proof statement that has been completely masked by the pandemic and its impact on the economy is in the last bid cycle, in the last bid season we were successful at winning business. We increased our penetration through the BCO cycle on their bid season and Kenny mentioned one, we increased our exposure in the parcel world and we've done it across a number of other retailers. So as we look forward, Brandon, you've got it exactly right. We are positioned to be able to grow and we're holding ourselves accountable for greater growth than we've experienced in the last 10 years. We should be able to achieve that. Kenny Rocker : Yes. The only thing I'll add to that also is that the team has done a great job of inserting product into our supply chain. So whether it's matchbacks in Dallas, whether it's reloads out of the Midwest, we're doing everything we can to make it sticky for our customers. We've worked with the port to get some really strong standards to get out of the port, working with Jim's team. I talked about the technology on the API side where we're working with our largest international carriers, so that we can have visibility to when they come in and instill confidence and trust in our service. So we're taking a active, very proactive approach to winning in those markets. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. So Jennifer, comp per employee was up 8%. I think you mentioned some severance. Can you quantify that and just give us some color on how to think about comp per employee going forward, just because it was a bunch higher than we thought? And then, can I just get one clarification? Lance you made a comment about intermodal and end-to-end. I'm not sure what that means and maybe what that should mean for the IMC relationship? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Sure. I'll take that after Jennifer. Jennifer Hamann : Sure. On the comp per employee side, Scott, you're right. I mentioned, we have wage inflation. That certainly was part of it. We did have severance. I'm not going to quantify that, but that is something that we don't expect to see in the fourth quarter. Jim mentioned some further headcount reductions that were made on the operating side of the world, so there was some severance involved with that. We also did have some higher cost per crew in the quarter. When you think about some of our weather challenges and the fact that we are staying quite lean from a headcount perspective and so we're working the crews a little bit harder, so a little bit higher overtime cost there. Going into the fourth quarter, we're going to still stay pretty lean as you still -- there's a little uncertainty around the economy. You've got the holiday season coming up, so I would expect that we're going to keep that crew base pretty lean. So you may see some elevated cost per crew. You're going to continue to have the wage inflation in 4Q, but you will not have the severance on a sequential basis. Lance? Lance Fritz : Yeah. And Scott, your question on what did I mean by end-to-end in the domestic intermodal world? That's not an announcement of us going retail. So let me be crystal clear about that. But it is an indication that -- and a recognition that the service product that wins in the marketplace looks transparent to a customer from end-to-end and needs to be simplified and much easier to deal with. And we are working with our IMCs and our significant IMC partners to make that happen. And that needs to look like one point of contact consistency across the entire supply chain. And there's just a whole lot of work that's going into that that I wanted to make sure wasn't lost in this call. Scott Group : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Hey, thanks and good morning. And congrats Jim, great job on the two years at the firm. I guess, I wanted to ask a question about sort of capital returns to shareholders. I know there's going to be some focus on debt pay down in the fourth quarter. Kind of curious, Jennifer, how you think about that impacting potential buybacks maybe in the near term, then sort of bigger picture do you think that there's an opportunity to kind of push a little harder on the buybacks as you go into next year and sort of cash flow comes up with earnings power? Just some thoughts around that would be helpful. Jennifer Hamann : Sure, Chris. Thanks. In terms of fourth quarter, we came in - or end of the quarter, I should say, cash balance of $2.6 billion. That's -- we've typically ran closer to $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of cash balances. We've obviously been more conservative with that over the last couple of quarters with the pandemic and uncertainty. Things feel like they're evening down a little bit although you see the same news I do where cases are surging in different parts of the country. And so, we're going to be careful with that. But we think fourth quarter is a good time for us to start redeploying some of that cash. With interest rates being as low as they are, it's doing very little for us sitting in the bank right now. So we want to put some of that back to work. We're doing that through shares as well as paying off some debt. It has a little bit higher coupon a little higher cost for us. So we think that's the right economic thing to do. And as we look into 2021, again, in January, we'll talk more fulsomely about what our plans are not just for how we see the year playing out but how we're going to deploy cash. But we think certainly our job is twofold. It's to generate the cash through business and efficiency, and then deploy it back to our shareholders. I think we've got a good track record of doing that and rewarding our shareholders and we plan to continue that. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, got it. Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Jim, congrats on another successful tenure, I think you have the respect of everybody on this conference call. Just a quick question. Is there anything limiting you from joining another railroad relatively quickly? And would you be open to that when you do leave UNP, if you can address that? And then, Lance and Jennifer, we've been talking about the potential for incremental margins for a long time now in terms of how good they could be when the revenue growth turns positive. I just don't think we saw it to the extent that we would have in the third quarter, especially when you look at the sequential movements in non-fuel expenses. It was obviously a very challenging quarter from a congestion perspective, which may have something to do with this. So I was hoping you could just answer one, did the quarter kind of meet your expectations around flow-through from the sequential revenue growth? And then two, any cost that are worth maybe calling out that are specific to the congestion that we all know about that occurred on the West Coast? Thank you. Jim Vena : You want to start? Jennifer Hamann : I think I want you to start. Jim Vena : Amit, you're pretty good. Thank you very much, and you slipped about five questions in there. That was pretty good. I love it. So, you've got it written down, Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : I think so. Jim Vena : So, listen, I'm 62 years old. I feel great. I'm not looking further than what I've had the responsibility right now going forward. But all I'll tell you is, listen, we're going to elect a President that's either 74 or 78. So, I'm still a young guy, and I'll leave it at that. Jennifer Hamann : And in terms of the margins, Amit, we did still have volumes down 4% in the quarter. And as I look at it, going from 2Q to 3Q, I would say that our margins improved sequentially, incrementally in the 60% kind of range. So I think that shows you there's power in the model. And as we look and see volumes go positive. I think that's the thing to focus on. And the fact with that we think we'll be able to have very strong incrementals. Were there some cost headwinds in the quarter? There always are. We called out the ones that we thought were most important. There were some severance costs. You've got a little associated with some of the mix impact. As Lance has said, that mix impact probably isn't going to change too much, but we're doing everything we can to improve the fluidity of the network and prove how efficiently we handle that business and that's our real opportunity. So, I'd say less in terms of big challenges more in terms of we see continued opportunity. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Amit, this is Lance. So, we're not disappointed at all with our incremental margins in the quarter, and we also think there's continued opportunity to be even better than that. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I have a three-part question but on one topic. So I guess that counts as one question. Just I know we've discussed intermodal a fair bet, but just a couple more follow-ups there. First, can you just give us some color on how your customers are kind of taking what's happening right now? I mean clearly a lot of it was unprecedented, but at the same time are they upset about the surcharges and the service issues, or are they understanding? Second, if you do get higher volumes once this normalizes but offset by adding more resources and fewer surcharges, what does that mean for the profitability of the intermodal business heading into next year? And third, I'm not sure if you actually said this now, but what is the time line for resolution for the network issues? Jennifer Hamann : What was that last part, Ravi, you dropped off a little bit? Ravi Shanker : What is the time line for resolution for the network issues on the intermodal side? I'm not sure if you actually quantified that. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I'll start that off. Jim, you jump in if you got any questions in. When we walked into the third quarter, the entire supply chain was constrained. It's not a rail issue. You got the terminals. You got the port. You got the dray careers. Everyone was constrained. What we did immediately was got together as a team would operate in and then concurrently engaged our customers. And we did a number of things. You brought up a few. We adjusted our rates -- the transactional rates and our surcharges to make sure that we could protect those customers that are with us year round. We also inserted some new processes in place. So we gave our customers new guidelines for when they could bring their containers in. We sat down and talk with our customers about container dwelling and chassis dwelling. I talked about this a little bit earlier. We inserted as much technology as we could, adjusting and getting a higher percentage of our customers to our ITR functions so that they could have greater visibility to when the containers would move. We work with our dray carriers and started technology there. So they have really crystal clear times on when they can drop off or pick up a container. So as we stand today real-time, we feel really good about where we are. Yes it was bumpy earlier in the quarter. I think our customers really appreciate how we have worked with them up to this point. What I would also tell you is that as we are working with them to insert more efficiency and rigor around those processes, it's opened up more opportunities for us. I feel very bullish about the fact that with what Jim is doing with the train service, what our terminals are doing we're handling as much as possible but we can still through efficiency and adding in a little bit more equipment get more volume out of it. So we're feeling pretty bullish about it. Jim Vena : Ravi, if I could and maybe I misunderstood the piece about how fluid the railroad is. The railroad is as fluid as it ever has been. We do not have a capacity issue. And in fact we are spending money to actually make it more efficient. Consolidation in Chicago that I talked about in prepared before was clear to say we want to consolidate to two big terminals and one smaller one in Chicago from six, so that we can turn the cars faster give the customer a better service be able to turn it. We see what the opportunity is and we also see what's happened north of the border and we think that to compete and to win without being a price discussion is to have a low cost. We operate our trains very efficiently. We operate them fast. We turn the cars quick. No one in North America moves in speed across their network with the premium business as fast as we do right now. So we can give the best service product to people whether you're going from L.A. over to Texas and we're going to be as fast as anybody into the Chicago market. So that's what it's all about. We think that if we have the right service, we got the capacity we know we have we spent on making the signings longer so that we can run more efficient trains. When our train miles are down, which means that -- in the 20% range that means that we've opened up that much capacity on top of the capacity we had before. So I'll tell you we have got this thing coming together properly. More efficient terminals, more efficient than visibility with our customers at the ports and working with the ports so that we have an efficient product there, move the containers out quicker, the domestic product to make speed and consistency that the customer wants. I'll tell you I'm very comfortable at where we're headed and we'll just continue to improve it. Lance Fritz : And Ravi, let me touch base on your margin question, right? Because you had a question about what's going to happen to margins on intermodal product as you look forward? In the long run and in the intermediate run, what Jim just outlined is a big driver of the margin on that product line, which is the efficiency of the service product and its service reliability. That sets us up for pricing through Kenny. And our expectation with all of our product lines is that over time, we're going to continue to have an opportunity to improve its margin. So I don't look forward and get a concern as volume grows that costs are going to overrun some other aspect of that product. We're in great shape. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And you mentioned the surcharges too. And I think it's important to point out those surcharges are really a net in the overall scheme of things. And so as we go through peak season we remove surcharges. That's not going to have an impact on our margins. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks for the great detail. And Jim thanks for everything and good luck for the next phase. Jim Vena : Thank you very much Ravi. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Q&A fatigue makes it difficult to count to one, but I'm going to try my best here. Kenny we've talked a lot about mix and yield and I think conceptually it makes sense when you think about the growth of intermodal and some of the headwinds in the bulk categories. But you guys break out very clearly the sequential pace within commodity. And when we look at like grain and food and refrigerated and coals and fertilizers, the sequential step down has been even bigger than in some of the lower mix businesses. So what's kind of behind that? And what does it take to reverse that negative trend in the higher yield bulk segments? Kenny Rocker : We're right there now. We -- I'll segment some of the commodities that you're talking about. We feel really good about grain and walking into this quarter the demand that's out there and the demand that should move in this quarter and I'll call it the near-term we should see more of that. If you look at the other industrial commodities I made the comment that they are improving sequentially. Now we can help with that we can go out and add business development wins on top of that. And that's what the team is focused on. Our marketing team has just done a great job of going out there with data analysis and looking at where we should be hunting, where we should look at prospect and where the leads are, where to reconnect with customers or smaller receivers that we've lost and the sales team has got a really good proactive look on how much business we're doing with them. So the markets are coming back slowly sequentially, which will help and we're going to accelerate that by going out there and win the business. Jon Chappell : Okay, great. And thank you Kenny. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning everyone. And Jim you answered all my questions about your departure just to say congrats and good luck to you as well. Jim Vena : Thank you. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. So moving on to Kenny I guess. You mentioned about stickiness of the customer and looking to get some fluidity out of the port. One of your peers in Canada has started to look proactively around using their land as a way to enhance or entice that stickiness about leasing land to a customer adjacent to facilities as one of those approaches. Do you have opportunity sets like that where when you look at your land portfolio that you could use that as a sales weapon to gain share in a more sticky way and in a way that gets some of that traffic and congestion out of the port and over to a transload facility more inland something along those lines? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Thanks for that question. The short answer is yes. And that's not something new for us. I don't want you to think that we haven't done that. We've been assessing our land, looking at our land. I won't go into details of where we are and how we think about it longer term, but I can tell you that we would expect to take advantage of the resources near the port. Jim Vena : A great case in point, Kenny. And we've talked about this for years now, is Dallas to Dock and development that's happening around the Dallas intermodal terminal which Walter is literally thousands of acres. In your mind think a couple of thousand acres that we are developing and have developed in concert with a property developer that is rail-centric in its perspective. There's opportunities like that that we either have in the hopper have already executed or are beginning development plans for. Walter Spracklin : Any time frame of when that could be converted to a deal? Jim Vena : Well sure. No specifics, but I would expect virtually every year we will have some aspect of that kind of business development occurring. Jennifer Hamann : I mean there's business there now and there's opportunities to go forward. And certainly, you've heard us talk Walter as we have been consolidating facilities. I mean we're generating more opportunities along those lines when you think about our footprint and the land profile that we have to work with customers to further grow. Jim Vena : Right. Walter Spracklin : Excellent. Thanks for the color. Jim Vena : Thanks, Walter. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please state your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I know you talked about this a little bit, so I hope this isn't too redundant, but I think it is something that investors and I think people were surprised on the change. So Jim, I was wondering if you could maybe offer any personal perspective on the change. I mean I think about it you don't sound like you're overly tired or unenthused about railroading. So it does -- it just seems surprising that you're leaving. So I don't know if there's any personal color you can add to that?  And whether there's a Board component? I mean do you talk to the Board about this and kind of say \"Hey why should I stay, or what's the path?\" So just wanted a little more perspective on that. And sticking with the two-part theme for Kenny, can you offer any thoughts on UP's franchise sensitivity to the homebuilding area? Just kind of how much of traffic is sensitive to that. So just a small add-on to that? Thank you. Jim Vena : So listen I appreciate the question. The Board has been very supportive, clear understanding of what I came in? What the time line was? What I wanted to do? How I wanted to set it up and at what point I wanted to move on? I want to read there is absolutely nothing. The relationship is great with Lance. Relationship is great with the entire team. It's just -- it's a great time for me to move on and have a long-term person set-up. And Eric is a long-term person. You see his age that he can drive this thing. And I'm very comfortable. This is a strong team like the people that are sitting here with me around the table, I'm very impressed with what Kenny has been able to perform. He's going to bring the business into this company. I just don't see -- we leverage the great facilities we have. It was a great question on -- that Walter asked us about what capability we have. So this is a great time. I think we've got a great network. We've got -- if not the best network pretty close to the best network in the entire industry. We leverage with a real efficient railroad. We grow the business. I just see this place keeping on moving ahead. And I've done what I needed to do. And Lance and I have worked out a real clear sort of help in the transition which I'll do with Eric and the entire team and I'm very comfortable that we've got the right team. And listen Jennifer is top-notch and the relationship Lance and I have had has been spectacular. An outsider coming into a company that's -- the storied history that UP has and they welcomed me, we worked together. I can't be more comfortable with everybody that I've worked with in this company. So Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So thanks for that question. I'll tell you we're encouraged by the recent numbers for housing starts here that came out earlier this week. What's more encouraging for us is the mix. So there's a stronger mix of single-family housing starts and the multi-family housing stars which works out well for us.  As a franchise, hey we enjoy some pretty long-haul shipments to Chicago down into Texas. And we feel good about our strategy and ability to compete along the I-5. I think what people fail to realize or sometimes miss is when we think about housing starts, we're just not thinking about the lumber. There's just so many other commodities that are behind it. You got cement, you've got PVC piping, you've got the rock, you've got plastic for the carpet. So housing starts just really fuel a lot of things. They got... Lance Fritz : They've got like furniture, appliances, roofing... Kenny Rocker : Look I could go on. It really fuels a lot of things. So that's a very encouraging macroeconomic change for us. Tom Wadewitz : Is there a way to ballpark it though? Is it like 10% of the book that's sensitive or 20%? What's the ballpark? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I think it's fair for us not to go in and try to arrange that out for you and just leave that the fact that, we like the fact that it's improving and we take advantage of moving not just that lumber of moving into the house, but everything associated with it. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Hi. I just wanted to come back quickly to the grain question. I know you said you're encouraged, but specifically on the export side our understanding is commitments for both soybean and corn are well above five-year averages to China. Just Kenny maybe you could give some sense or scope of the export grain franchise for UP? And what sort of tailwind that could really be? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So I've got myself in trouble trying to size this grain market before. So what I will confirm for you is that you're right in line, it's going to be right in there with the highs over the last five years. It's going to be a really strong market. And so I can confirm that for you. I won't size it for you, but it's going to be a really strong market for us. Jordan Alliger : And Kenny, we'll participate there both out the PNW, we'll participate there out the Gulf? Kenny Rocker : We've seen significant growth in those three areas and I'm adding Mexico to it. And so the PNW, the Gulf and Mexico, we have seen significant emphasis on that significant growth and we've got high expectations for the quarter. Jordan Alliger : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. David Ross : Thank you. And Jim, now that you mentioned, can you just run for [indiscernible]. Jim Vena : I'm an American citizen, but I wasn\u2019t born in the U.S., so I cannot do it. Otherwise I would like to do sometime, let me tell you. David Ross : I would love to get you on Ballard, is a better third option. Going back to the improved efficiency of the network and the excess capacity that's generating for the UP, specifically in terms of railcar locomotive needs, how much do you think you can really grow volume-wise before you need new railcars new locomotives? And how much of that capacity have you actually taken out removed, retired versus just keeping in storage for future growth? Kenny Rocker : Well let me start and then maybe Jennifer you want to talk about how we're handling it. But sure we've got lots of locomotives. I didn't even mention it this time. I think we've got 3,000 of them parked. So we won't be needing locomotives. If we could sell some of them and I'll leave that to Jennifer, but if we could do something and monetize them, I think we would but a pretty tough market. On the railcar side, it's depending on the mix of the traffic. We have cars, available cars parked, we've returned as many as we can to make us more efficient that way. So it's a mix on what we would have to add depending on the business. That's the way I look at it. If we were done operationally then you could say \"Boy if the business went up on one segment on the grain side, we'd have to go on and lease more cars to bring it in.\" We will not. We still have efficiency left to be able to \u2013 if the business goes up x, we're going to be half of that on the cars that we have to put in to be able to handle that business. And that's what I'm real comfortable with. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And on the freight car and locomotive side David, freight cars, we tend to own \u2013 this isn't entirely true but we tend to own the multi-use kind of cars. And so as you see changes in markets like we've seen the surge in grain, we've been able to repurpose some cars that had been hauling, I think fertilizer and move into grain service and obviously box cars is \u2013 can move anything. So our freight car fleet, we feel good about where that's at and our ability to deploy it as we need to. On the locomotive side, we look at the fleet by type, we have a relatively young fleet kind of overall and we have opportunities to modernize that fleet and redeploy it as the volumes come back up. And we see that as an opportunity for us going forward. We're obviously going to use that fleet as efficiently as possible, but we've got plans for every locomotive we own. And whether it's today or maybe tomorrow, that's the opportunity for us. And that's \u2013 you've heard us talk a lot about growth and the growth of margins. The capital efficiency of our ability to grow going forward is tremendous. When you think about the fact that we have the freight car assets, the locomotives and the track assets to put more business across and leverage that investment that we've already made is a tremendous opportunity for us. So we look forward to taking advantage of it. David Ross : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in and Jim our best to you. I wanted to ask with the industry now operating based on kind of a similar philosophy, do you think there's an opportunity to work together a bit more creatively to develop new interchange traffic? Lance Fritz : 100% Cherilyn. And we're actively working that with every other Class I railroad partner, of course excluding BNSF, there's really not much opportunity to do that with them. But whether you think about it in the context of \u2013 historically, there's this watershed area. And for us that typically is along the Mississippi River, where if there's an origination on my side of the river, it's short haul for me to get it to an Eastern carrier. And a lot of times historically that's not looked terribly attractive. But when we're all thinking about our business the same way now and we're all eager to grow with our excellent service product, we're all starting to think about you know, just because it's a short-haul on my side, if it generates an attractive relationship with the customer, it gets more railroad penetration and there's opportunity on their side of the river to originate for us, we're making those trades. And we're not doing it historically like we might have where in order to make the move attractive for me, I'm going to move it out a route and put it to a gateway where it doesn't make sense. So I get a little length of haul. That's not happening anymore, right? We're all thinking very clearly about best overall route structure. What's the price it takes to win? Is that attractive in total? And if it is let's do it. And doing it collectively. Kenny Rocker : Yes. And I want to add on this one Lance. So to Lance's point, you're right. We're thinking about it as what would we do if we're one railroad. And that's product development components associated with that not just service. It could be something a little bit more than that. It could be something \u2013 a physical footprint that's there. Obviously, the equipment efficiency plays a part of it. But on an analog basis how do we go out and win that truck traffic that's out there that we haven't been able to capture. Lance Fritz : Amen. A lot of opportunity there Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Vernon, your line is open for question. David Vernon : Sorry, I was on mute there. So, Lance I wanted to come back to the question on domestic intermodal. We continue to hear from shippers as well as some of the supply chain partners that the ease of accessing the network, the service on the network is what it is and you guys have reported good metrics there. But as you think about the friction costs of getting in and out of the terminals on the intermodal, that is kind of holding back growth to a degree. And I'm just wondering, what can you as Union Pacific do over the next couple of years to solve that problem? You mentioned earlier that going retail or developing more retail capabilities isn't part of the solution. But I'm just wondering, how do we get out of the situation where when demand picks up, you end up in a situation where you got to throw up surcharges to keep traffic out of the yards? Lance Fritz : Yes. Great question, David. And I want to also be clear, I didn't say that at some point in the future retail isn't the answer. I just wanted to make sure nobody thought I was announcing a new product on our call. So technology plays a really big role in what you were just talking about. What you're talking about David is fundamentally ease of doing business and removing blockages that keep customers from using the rail intermodal product. And to your point, Kenny has mentioned this before ITR. One of those can be, if you schedule a truck, when you bid for a truck you can get it scheduled at the time you want it, where you want it and be very confident that it's going to show up for you to load or to empty. We're reflecting the same kind of thing through ITR. ITR is basically a reservation system that allows domestic intermodal customers to know hey, I want to move this container from here to there and A., do you have availability on the day I want it? If the answer is yes, I'm booked and I know I got it. If the answer is no, I know when I can get it. And if it doesn't match my needs, it doesn't match my needs. But at least I have clarity and I don't make an assumption and then get angry when it doesn't happen. So that's one small example. We're also making it much easier for dray drivers, when they come on to the ramp with UPGo to be able to get through the gate quickly, know exactly where to park, where to drop-off and where to pick up and go. So they're getting a lot of help that way. We're helping the BCOs also by making sure we're tracking down chassis and keeping them productive in our terminal areas, right? Sometimes chassis get off property and they get lost or used for very different purposes that aren't bringing business to and from the railroad. So, there's just hundreds of different activity items in there that ultimately lead to a better customer experience. That's what I mean by that end-to-end experience. Kenny, you got anything else for that? Kenny Rocker : No. I mean, the fact that we're sitting down with our customers, talking about these chassis, talking about the container dwell, giving them really good data points, managing with data. So yeah, that's good. David Vernon : And is there anything in the terminal side itself from an automation standpoint, or better throughput capacity that would also need to be addressed? Because this seems like every time the truck market gets tight we end up in the same kind of pig in the python, kind of problem. Lance Fritz : That's a great question, right? And part of that is, yes. We can continue to be better and better, as we're rebuilding G4. We're introducing wide span gantry cranes there. That will be part of being able to get a box on and off, a well quickly. But part of that also though is making sure we have visibility deeper into the supply chain. Right now if stuff shows up with very little advanced notice, it's hard to realign our rail resources to handle it. To the extent we can get a week or even two, we can realign our resources pretty quickly. That gets back to ITR. ITR is most effective, when a maximum number of customers are using it. And they're using it as far out as they can. And we're working really hard with our customer base to get that to be kind of normalized behavior. David Vernon : All right. Thanks a lot for the time guys. Lance Fritz : Yes. Kenny Rocker : Thank you. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yes Jim, congrats on the time you spend here. And good luck with whatever is next. Just wanted to focus on -- in the eight or nine months you've got left here, what are the one or two things you absolutely feel like you must wrap-up? And what are the larger projects that are going to take another couple of years or so, under Eric's leadership that are really kind of focused for that transition? Jim Vena : Okay. Short-term, listen, we've had a lot of discussion about our intermodal service products. We see that as a growth area. So I'm going to concentrate on making sure the end-to-end view. Ports, domestic terminals, we make them as efficient as possible. We make the interaction with the customer as clear as possible, so that we can react better. I think we did a pretty good job of reacting to the big -- the bump up in business. But I think we can be better. Want to concentrate on the relationship with the other railroads. And how we interchange and how we move traffic back and forth, to make it even cleaner than we are today, because I think we can both win. That was a great question on, how we're reacting with the other customers. And listen, other than locomotives, asset utilization service, productivity, that's what I'm going to concentrate on in the next -- and I'll let Eric run it. And we'll make sure that we're attuned lined up together and finish that off. So that's what I'm going to do in the next six to eight months. Bascome Majors : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question. Jairam Nathan : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a question on CapEx. How should we think about it for next year given I think you're not going to be acquiring any locomotives. But are there any projects planned for next year, which would kind of puts and takes on the CapEx side? And also if you could -- I know you mentioned the package business is a very good business. Can you just kind of go through some of the economics of that business here? Lance Fritz : I'll take CapEx. Jennifer, from a project perspective, there's nothing big that's unusual on the horizon. We're sticking with our guidance Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. I mean, the less than 15% of revenue is where we would plan to be again for next year. And obviously, we'll talk more about that in January. I know we still have some siding projects that we plan to finish out some that, will finish out yet this year and a little bit more of that work. But we continue to have a robust plan. We'll modernize locomotives. We'll continue to make sure the infrastructure is in good shape. So I feel good about our ability to spend that capital to keep the railroad safe, efficient and add the capacity as needed for customers. Lance Fritz : Well. And one thing that we haven't talked about on this call is our new CIO, coming over starting at the beginning of November. And technology we've talked about throughout the call is an important element of our overall service product and ability to grow and win business and I'm sure he's going to have a help and we'll also have some capital elements, but I don't think it will be an unusually high spend. Jennifer Hamann : No. Kenny do you want to...? Kenny Rocker : I don't have anything else. Jennifer Hamann : I thought he asked... Lance Fritz : He asked about parcel. How is the parcel biz and... Kenny Rocker : Yes. I mean parcel has been strong. We've gone out there -- the market has grown, but like I mentioned we've gone out there and had some pretty strong wins across the board on our parcel business. Expanding beyond parcel because parcel business is a pretty what I'll call service-sensitive business. I've been very proud of the team our loop teams our carry [indiscernible] team. We've been able to win some service-sensitive business with two large OEMs. All of this is truck traffic. One of them is a new entrant to rail so -- and the product is both short haul and long haul. So if you look at e-commerce and look at the service-sensitive markets the team and -- behind that service product has done a great job of growing it. Jairam Nathan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question of the day comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys, good morning. So I just wanted to make sure I understand the comments around new business opportunities and wins. Are you starting to see those accelerate and broaden here with the improved network and some of the efficiencies that you pulled through? And certainly understanding it's been an unusual year. Are those opportunities where you thought they would be at this point in your journey? Any thoughts there? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So the two changes there is a strong reliable service product that we haven't had in some time. The other thing is a lower cost structure would also make piece of the business more attractive that we haven't seen. I made some comments around opening up new markets and gave some examples of long-haul business just a few minutes ago. But we're also seeing the same thing with some short-haul business -- short-haul carload business where again if we can add large pieces to existing train service or even small volume pieces to existing train service, it drops to the bottom line. But those two things alone have really enabled our sales team and our marketing team to be very pointed and deliberate in having conversations with our customers about truck conversions. Allison Poliniak : Great. And just -- are those opportunities kind of now at this point in your journey are you kind of thinking are they where they should be at this point? Are they a little better? Any thoughts there? Kenny Rocker : We have. We certainly have room to grow. There's opportunity for us to grow. And we're excited and bullish on where we expect to be. But there's no part of this where we're ready to say that we've arrived or we're done. We've got a lot of room to grow here. Lance Fritz : Yes. Allison we think more, sooner better. That's what Kenny hears all the time. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you again Rob and thanks everyone for the questions. It was a really good session today. I want to thank Jim again. I'm so pleased we've got him for as long as we do. We're going to put him to good use over the next eight months. And we look forward to talking with all of you again in January to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Until then I wish you all good health. Please take care of yourself and take care. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you very much, Rob, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. I apologize for the delay. Our service provider was experiencing technical difficulties this morning. We will handle any necessary and appropriate public disclosures after the call. With me today in Omaha are Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before discussing our fourth quarter and full year results, I must first acknowledge the performance of our exceptional employees. 2020 presented challenges that no one anticipated and all of us hope to never experience again. The women and men of Union Pacific worked hard in the face of the pandemic to provide our customers with fluid and uninterrupted service. Their dedication produced service and efficiency improvements that are now part of the UP DNA, positioning our company to flourish in the days ahead. This past year has reinforced my conviction that our people are truly the best in the business. Moving on to our fourth quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2020 fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.05 per share. These results include the impact of the previously announced $278 million pretax non-cash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment. Excluding that charge, adjusted net income is $1.6 billion or $2.36 per share. This compares to $1.4 billion or $2.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our adjusted quarterly operating ratio came in at 55.6%, an all time quarterly record and 410 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2019. These outstanding results demonstrate our potential when we leverage all three profitability drivers simultaneously, volume growth, productivity and pricing. Our fourth quarter and full year performance bolsters the optimism we have for the long-term potential of our company. To provide a bit more detail, we\u2019re going to start with Eric and an operations update. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. The operating team delivered impressive results in the quarter, as we did an excellent job adding volume to our network in an extremely efficient manner, while also managing the normal challenges associated with the holidays. The fourth quarter is another proof statement of how PSR has continued to transform our operations. I\u2019m proud of our entire operating team and their achievements during a very challenging year. We could have not achieved what we did in 2020 without their support and commitment. Moving to slide four, I\u2019d like to update you on our key performance indicators where the team once again made improvements across nearly all of our measures. Freight car velocity and freight car terminal dwell both improved year-over-year, driven by focusing on asset utilization and reducing car touches. Locomotive and workforce productivity both all time quarterly records improved as we continue to use those resources more efficiently through our PSR journey. These improvements were driven by an evergreen process to evaluate and adjust our transportation plan, while using fewer locomotives. In addition, the train and engine workforce decreased 12% versus 2019, while volume increased 3%. In the face of intermodal volume growth of 12%, we maintain a high level of service as evidenced by our intermodal trip plan compliance results. To achieve higher levels, we are working with customers to improve the timely pickup of containers in order to improve box turns, increase parking capacity and create chassis supply. We view our intermodal ramps as production facilities that must improve their efficiency in order to drive a more reliable service product. Finally, our manifest service remains strong during the quarter, driving a 3 point improvement in trip planned compliance for manifest and autos. The team did an excellent job of maintaining this service product throughout the year, despite the significant fluctuations in demand. This past year presented quite the challenge to the operating team. The drastic fall off in volume in April, followed by the rapid recovery in July required agility, as we shut down portions of our operations and then reopen them, all while staying focused on keeping our employees safe and healthy. The improvement we made across all of our key metrics during 2020 provides a strong foundation for continued improvement in 2021. Slide five highlights some of our recent network changes. We continue to push train length to drive productivity, while providing a better service product to our customers. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, when we first began implementing precision scheduled railroading, we have increased train length across our system by 30% or 2100 feet to approximately 9150 feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This is a tremendous progress, especially when you consider that our seven-day car loadings fell 9% over the same period. One enabler of this great progress is our siding extension program. We completed 36 sidings in 2020, allowing longer trains to run in both directions and reducing train starts. This was a monumental accomplishment by our engineering department to finish these sidings and then by our network design team to leverage this increased capability. The redesign of our operations in Houston remained on track. Recent investments at our Englewood yard focused on extending the bowl tracks to add density to the yard and facilitate longer trains. This project also leverages the investments we\u2019ve made along the main line. Finally, last month, we announced a new service from Southern California to a pop up intermodal ramp in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. With minimal capital investment, we are turning an existing yard into a small intermodal terminal, allowing us to provide new service to an attractive market in a quick and efficient manner. As I look to the future, I\u2019m excited about the full pipeline of projects. We have to drive service enhancements and productivity across our entire network. Turning to capital spending, as demonstrated on slide six, Union Pacific continues to deliver value to our shareholders through the efficient use of capital. Our PSR implementation has generated significant capacity, allowing us to maintain this discipline in 2021. Pending final approval by our Board of Directors, we are targeting capital spending of $2.9 billion in 2021, basically flat with last year. About 80% of our planned capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. We remained focused on modernizing our locomotive fleet through the upgrade of older core units, generating a longer life out of an existing asset, boosting its reliability and improving its fuel efficiency is a win for all stakeholders. The plan also includes targeted freight car acquisitions to support replacement and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in capacity projects on our network to improve productivity and operational efficiency. We plan to complete more than 20 siding extensions focused in the Southern and Pacific Northwest parts of our network. These sidings support our train length initiatives and target future growth areas for our business. Finally, we remain focused on our enhancements to our energy management system to reduce fuel consumption, leveraging integration with our PTC platform. Looking to 2021, we remain focused on continuing to drive the organization using the PSR principles that have led us to this new level of operational excellence. Everything we do must be done with an eye towards doing our work safer. While maintaining a high standard on the prevention of our personal injuries, we recognize we have yet to reach our full potential. Our improvement in rail incidents in 2020 indicates that we have the right plan in place to make the entire network safer. We will be judicious with our resources and turn them quickly. We are determined to be as efficient as possible at our terminals to improve the reliability of our service product and we will push productivity through train length and other initiatives. We must continue to deliver a highly consistent and reliable service product for our customers. There are many opportunities for us to improve across all aspects of our operations, we must seize upon those in order to fulfill the long-term goals of our railroads. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Today I\u2019m pleased to report our fourth quarter results as our volume was up 3%. The fourth quarter ended strong with December posting the highest seven-day carloaded month in 2020. Solid gains in our premium business grew during the quarter were partially offset by declines in our industrial market. Freight revenue was down 1% for the quarter, as our increase in volume was offset by lower fuel and a negative mix -- business mix. So let\u2019s take a closer look at how the fourth quarter performed for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 1% on flat volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 16% as a result of continued high customer inventory levels, lower export demand and a mild start to winner. Volume for grain and grain products was up 20%, driven by increased demand for export grain. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 2% due to less export potash shipment, which was partially offset by strong industrial sulfur and domestic fertilizer shipments. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 7% due primarily to strong beverage shipments in the quarter. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue declined 7% from a 6% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 2% due to lower fuel surcharge and negative mix. Energy and specialized shipments decreased 16%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices and reduced demand. Forest product volume grew by 11%. Strength in lumber was driven by strong housing start, along with an increase in repair and remodel. We also saw strength in brown paper, driven by increased box demand and low inventory. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were flat for the quarter. Lower industrial chemicals volume was offset by growth in plastics from increased production and improved operating rates. Domestic plastic demand for food packaging and medical supplies remain strong. Metals and minerals volume was down 7%, primarily driven by market softness in rock and reduced frac sand shipments associated with the decline in oil prices and surplus local sands. Turning now to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 5% on a 9% increase in volume, average revenue per car declined by 4%, reflecting the mix impact from increased intermodal shipments. Automotive volume was down 3% for the quarter. Finished vehicle shipments were flat, highlighting continued recovery in demand and strong inventory restocking. Shipments of auto parts were down 5%, mostly due to COVID-related disruptions, causing supply chain shortages apart. Intermodal volume increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in domestic truckload and parcel shipments. Despite the pandemic, retail sales increase throughout the quarter and we continue to see the ecommerce footprint grow as a percentage of total sales. Now looking ahead to 2021, as we put together our plan for the year, we start with the key economic indicators that drive our business, as illustrated on slide 12. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on the economic forecast. As you know, there has been some volatility in recent months with the timing of the recovery, largely push into the second half of 2021. But the latest economic assumptions released in January, show more bullish outlook in some markets. While our goal is to outpace the market, there are still some pieces of our business that will continue to be adversely impacted by external factors. The piece we\u2019re watching most closely is the industrial economy, which is still expected to be weak year-over-year in the first quarter. Looking more closely at our three business teams, for our bulk commodities, we expect a continued negative outlook for coal in 2021. Electricity demand and natural gas prices are forecasted to improve. However, high customer inventory levels entering the year combined with an increased demand for other energy sources and a contract loss presents a challenging market. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. All in, we see lower year-over-year coal volumes, reducing total company carloading by roughly 1%. However, there is continued strength for export grain, as China remains committed to incremental ag product purchases in the 2021 calendar year, with clearly a tougher year-over-year comparison in the back half of the year. We also are optimistic with our biofuel shipments, a domestic production is expected to increase which will drive new volume at new UP destination facilities of renewable diesel feedstocks and finished products. Looking at our industrial commodities, energy comp for the first quarter will continue to be challenged and beyond the first quarter, there is uncertainty. However, our diverse portfolio, improved service product and ability to compete will drive growth. In addition, we\u2019re encouraged with the sequential improvements we\u2019re seeing for industrial production and a projection for growth in the second half. This improvement along with growth in plastic shipments should be a positive for us in 2021. And lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift in both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to closer to 16 million in 2021. A continuing benefit from vehicle inventory restocking efforts, plus recent win to convert finished vehicles and auto parts shipments from over-the-road truck will further bolster UP\u2019s automotive business. Retail inventories remain relatively low and truck utilization is expected to remain high in 2021. Retail inventory restocking along with continued strengthened retail sales and a tighter trucks supply should drive domestic intermodal volumes higher in the year. Our premium business will benefit from the new Twin Cities intermodal terminal, which Eric mentioned earlier. We\u2019re starting out small with current capacity of roughly 20,000 loads and future plans to build out to over five times that. We\u2019re excited to see that this new terminal has already started to receive loaded containers from Los Angeles in the first week of January. Furthermore, we continue to pursue additional expansion opportunity to penetrate the market. In summary, I\u2019m proud of our commercial team. They did a fabulous job in 2020 to stay close to customers and win new business. As we began 2021, I\u2019m excited about the opportunities we have in the pipeline to grow with customers and penetrate new markets. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. I\u2019m going to start off this morning with our adjusted income statement on slide 15, where we provide both the reported and adjusted look to remove the impact of the Brazos impairment charge. Throughout my remarks today I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $5.1 billion, down 1% versus 2019 on a 3% year-over-year volume growth. Adjusted operating expense decreased 8% to $2.9 billion as we continue demonstrating our ability to grow without adding costs in at a one for one. Taken together, we are reporting fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $2.3 billion, a 9% increase versus 2019. Other income of $66 million is up $10 million versus 2019, as a result of increased real estate gains. Interest expense was flat compared to 2019, as we mitigated the impact of increased debt levels by lowering our effective interest rate 20 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted net income of $1.6 billion increased 13% versus 2019, which when combined with share repurchases led to a 17% increase in earnings per share to $2.36. Our 55.6 % adjusted operating ratio was 410 basis points better year-over-year and is an all time quarterly record for Union Pacific. Core improvement totaled 320 basis points as lower fuel prices contributed 90 basis points. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4.8 billion, down 1% versus 2019, 3% volume growth was offset by the impact of lower diesel fuel prices, down 33% year-over-year, which reduced revenue by 3.5 points. Although, we continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation in the fourth quarter and experienced an improving pricing environment, these gains were more than offset by a negative business mix and reduced freight revenue a 0.25 point. Strong intermodal volumes and lower petroleum carloads were a mixed headwind in the fourth quarter. However, strength in grain shipments helped mitigate that impact both year-over-year and sequentially. Now let\u2019s move on to slide 17, which provides a summary of our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. Starting first with compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 3% year-over-year as we offset wage inflation and the $37 million one-time employee bonus with lower force counts, excluding the bonus impact, quarterly cost per employee remained elevated, increasing 9% as we tightly managed headcount. Fourth quarter workforce levels declined 14% or about 4,800 full time equivalents, driven primarily by the great work Jim, Eric and team have done to grow train length, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 12%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces to kept together decreased 15%. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 35%, a result of lower diesel fuel prices and an improved fuel consumption rate offset by volume growth. Our fourth quarter fuel consumption rate decreased 4% versus 2019, with roughly half of the improvement driven by core productivity, half from middle line run through fuel adjustments, with some offset related to business mix. Purchase services and material expense declined 7% in the quarter, driven by more productive use of our locomotive fleet and a couple of favorable interline settlements. As automotive shipments remain impacted by the pandemic, subsidiary drayage expense was also lower year-over-year. Equipment and other rents fell 4% in the quarter, as a result of lower locomotive and freight car lease expense, as we continue to use those assets more efficiently. Increased intermodal volumes offset a portion of those savings however. The other expense line is where you see the impact of the $278 million non-cash impairment charge, when adjusted this expense category was up 2% year-over-year. As you\u2019ll recall, last year, in the fourth quarter, we reported a $25 million insurance recovery in this cost line. So, solid expense control including state and local taxes, which ended the quarter better than expected. Freight loss and damage expense also was lower year versus 2019, as we run a safer railroad. Turning for a moment to our 2021 expense expectations, look for the following. Depreciation expense to be relatively flat versus 2020, purchase services and materials expense to increase high-single digits with the recovery in the auto volumes and other expenses should be up low-single digits, primarily driven by higher state and local taxes in 2021, and for income taxes, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Looking now at productivity, we continued our strong productivity trend in the fourth quarter, generating $170 million of productivity. We finished 2020 at $708 million and a total of nearly $1.4 billion over the past two years, a fantastic achievement by the entire Union Pacific team. These productivity gains were led by the operating departments continued progress on train length initiatives and more efficient use of all of our resources. Importantly, as Eric demonstrated on the KPI slide, we achieve this higher level of productivity, while also improving the reliability of our service product. To finalize the cost variability analysis we provided throughout 2020, slide 18 illustrates how we were more than volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis, whether viewed year-over-year or sequentially. Stepping back to look at full year 2020 on slide 19, we\u2019re reporting earnings per share of $7.88, which when adjusted for the impairment charge is $8.19, declining only 2% versus 2019, despite facing volume and revenue declines of 7% and 10%, respectively, driven by the strong productivity gains, I just discussed, adjusted operating income only declined 5% to $8.1 billion. Our full year adjusted operating ratio of 58.5% represents an improvement of 210 basis points versus 2019. Collectively, these results demonstrate the organization\u2019s agility and overall transformation as we work to overcome 2020 challenges. Turning now to cash and returns, Union Pacific maintained a strong cash position throughout 2020, as we purposefully maintain greater liquidity through the pandemic, while at the same time, continuing to generate significant cash flow. Aided by the timing of some tax payments, full year 2020 cash from operations decreased only 1% versus 2019 to $8.5 billion, despite a 6% decrease in adjusted net income. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, resulting in 101% adjusted cash conversion rate. Our dividend payout ratio for 2020 adjusted for the impairment charge was 47% or slightly above our 40% to 45% target range, as we maintain their dividend through the economic downturn and distributed $2.6 billion to shareholders. And although we paused our repurchase activity during 2020 in an effort to preserve liquidity, we still repurchased a total of 22 million common shares or 4% during 2020, at an all in cost of $3.7 billion. This includes repurchases of 749 million made in the fourth quarter. In combination dividends and share repurchases totaled $6.3 billion returned to our shareholders. Turning to the strength of our balance sheet, Union Pacific remains committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, ending 2020 with a BAA1 rating from Moody\u2019s and an A- from S&P. Excluding the impairment charge, we finished the year at a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times. Our all in adjusted debt balance at December 31, 2020, of $29 billion increased $1.5 billion from your in 2019, as we took actions in the fourth quarter to pay down $1.3 billion of debt, given our strong liquidity position. Finally, our adjusted return on invested capital came in at 14.3%, down from 2019, due to the impact of the pandemic on our earnings and while a declining ROIC is never desirable, staying within a historically high range reflects our long-term capital discipline, as well as the added benefit of PSR capacity creation. Turning to 2021, we are confident in our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead. Importantly, our outlook for the year includes the potential for improvement across all three performance drivers, volume, price and productivity. With volume we\u2019re looking for full year growth in the 4% to 6% range, largely driven by year-over-year increases in the second quarter. Our visibility to the year is murky however and it really depends on a number of factors, the vaccine rollout, the sustainability of consumer demand and trade, particularly as it relates to grain volumes and a second half industrial recovery. But as you heard from Kenny, we are bullish about our opportunity to win in the marketplace and drive business to our railroad. From a business mix perspective, we see mixed staying negative in 2021, with the most pronounced challenges in the first and fourth quarters. The first quarter will be pressured as we move from an environment where crude and industrial car loadings grew in 2020 to today where those volumes are lower year-over-year admits growing intermodal business. However, we could see those first quarter headwinds moderate some if grain shipments stay strong. That grain strength and tough year-over-year comparisons will likely become a headwind though in the back half of 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter. With an improved demand environment, as well as a reliable service product, we will remain disciplined in our pricing approach and expect to yield pricing dollars in excessive inflation dollars in 2021, embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all in inflation for the year is expected to be around 2.25%. On the productivity front, you heard Eric outline our plans for continued progress, which should generate roughly $500 million of added productivity this year. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation and ongoing productivity should produce a full year operating ratio that is one of the best if not the best in the rail industry in 2021. And assuming the year plays out, as I have just described, we\u2019d expect to be in the range of 150 basis points to 200 basis points of operating ratio improvement 2021, so another solid year of gains. In terms of first quarter guidance, we\u2019re expecting volumes to grow in the low single-digit range, with a potentially tougher operating ratio comparison, dependent on the mix headwinds, I just mentioned. Turn into cash and capital, you heard our plan to invest around $2.9 billion of capital for the year, well within our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue, as we generate capacity through our PSR journey. The combination of topline growth, increasing profitability and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate that again is in that 100% range and positions us to drive strong cash returns to our shareholders in the form of an industry leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases. Bottomline, we expect our performance in 2021 to be a great step toward achieving a 55% operating ratio, which is ultimately about enabling growth through efficiency and generating more cash. Before I turn it back to Lance, I\u2019d like to add my thank you to our exceptional workforce. 2020 was a very difficult year and our employees really rose up against the adversity and showed us what is possible. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. When we began our PSR journey in the fourth quarter of 2018, our objective was to drive efficiency across every facet of the operations while providing customers with a safer and more reliable service product. As you heard today, we\u2019ve made tremendous strides toward that goal and we are building a solid foundation of operational excellence. We made good progress across a number of areas in safety last year. We achieved substantial improvement on the rail incident side, while we held the line on personal injuries in a very challenging year. Our safety performance is moving in the right direction and I expect continued improvement. In 2020 we took a step forward to reverse the impact of global warming. Our commitment to set science-based targets and an improved fuel consumption rate demonstrate our pledge to operate sustainably. While there\u2019s more work to be done, these are important milestones to reduce our carbon footprint and help our customers do the same. Best of all, our enhanced service product combined with a lower cost structure is helping UP win in the marketplace and grow. And as you heard from Kenny, our team is energized about the prospect of an improving economy that only expands opportunity to win new business. To wrap up, watch for more information soon on an upcoming Investor Day in early May. While we would love to meet in person, it will most likely be a virtual event. Regardless, we\u2019re excited to lay out our vision to lead Union Pacific into a future of long-term growth and excellent returns. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Maybe to start with one for Jennifer on the guidance, so you talked about the expectation for 150 basis points to 200 basis points of improvement this year. But just given there were some unusual items in 2020, can you talk about the base 2020 OR that you\u2019re using for that guidance? And then on the first quarter OR guidance, I just wanted to clarify, are you expecting a deterioration on a sequential basis or year-over-year? I just wanted to make sure I understood that. Jennifer Hamann : Okay. I\u2019ll start with that last one, Justin, in terms of the Q1. As you know, there\u2019s seasonality in our operating ratio and Q1 is generally our worst operating ratio of the year. And so my comments were on a year-over-year basis, not sequentially. Because that\u2019s -- that would be a very tough call to roll Q4 into Q1 when you think about the fact that you\u2019ve got the inflation that comes in year one, first of the year in terms of inflation, health and welfare, payroll tax is starting up again. So that was a year-over-year comment. In terms of full year guidance, when we look at the 58.5%, we did have about 130 basis points that was attributable to fuel on a year-over-year basis and as we\u2019re looking forward, we\u2019re really not expecting any kind of a headwind or tailwind from fuel as part of that 150 basis points to 200 basis points of guidance into next year. You\u2019re right there were some unusual things that happened during the course of 2020. We did take some employee salary actions through the course of the year. We did that for about three months. We shut down some shop closures. So obviously those will be costs that will come back into the year that aren\u2019t going to be present on a year-over-year basis. But that\u2019s how we look at it and so when we\u2019re giving the 150 basis points to 100 -- excuse me, 150 basis points to 200 basis points, that\u2019s to the 58.5%, and obviously, you can make some adjustments to that to kind of set up what you see as a comparable. Justin Long : Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, I wanted to ask about service and the key performance metrics. I know you have that slide in the presentation that outlines the progression there. But talking to shippers, the big question is, has a service improvement come as a function of a lower volume environment? I know in the fourth quarter that that changed. But how are you thinking about those key performance metrics in 2021 as volumes improve, and let\u2019s say, they\u2019re in line with your guidance? Do you feel like you can still improve on these performance metrics across the board, and if so, maybe you could talk about where you see the most opportunity? Lance Fritz : Eric, do you want to take that. Eric Gehringer : Yeah. I appreciate the question. So as we\u2019ve mentioned before, we did have challenges when you look at the entire ecosystem that is the supply chain. As we\u2019ve reported this morning on a 12% increase in volume in intermodal, we also saw an improvement in our trip plan compliance for intermodal up to 83%. I do expect that to continue. There is opportunities moving forward. I can even tell you three weeks into the year, I\u2019ve seen a significant improvement off that 83% fourth quarter base. Now when you think about the opportunities and where we can go with that to continue to improve, we\u2019ve been focused on that in 2020 and it remains a very critical item for us in 2021. As we think about how do we operate our intermodal terminals, but also how do we partner with our customers. So we\u2019ve spoken before about the Gate Reservation System, that\u2019s a continued opportunity for us. Every opportunity that we can see as a railroad that inbound traffic allows us to more efficiently plan for it, and obviously, turn that efficiency into improved performance for the customer. At the same time, you\u2019re seeing us work through the intermodal ramps themselves and when we think about generating capacity, how do we ensure that we do that in a very reliable manner, because increased capacity will drive fluidity and that fluidity drives to better performance over the road. So very focused on in 2021 and it\u2019ll be a key result that we need to drive even off this relatively high base of 83% in the fourth quarter. Lance Fritz : Hey. Eric and Justin, just a proof statement, when you look backwards into 2020, we improved year-over-year our service product in the second quarter as volumes drop and we improved our service product year-over-year in the third quarter and fourth quarter when volumes came back. So we\u2019ve got a proof statement that we\u2019re able to in either environment continue to make improvements. Kenny Rocker : I\u2019ll add there, we\u2019ve been working really closely with our customers and they have recognized that as the product comes through our line, that that service product has improved. So Eric talked about the whole supply chain. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen some puts and takes in terms of chassis supply and that sort of thing. But once that is on our network, Eric and his team are really performing. Justin Long : Okay. Great. I appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit about the outlook on the volume side and narrowed down a bit 4% to 6% sounds pretty good on the outlook. You mentioned domestic intermodal growing, could you talk a little bit about the international intermodal expectations, especially as we go throughout the year, because there was -- there seems to be a clear ramp up through the ports in fourth quarter and actually in the 1Q here? Lance Fritz : Kenny, do you want to take that. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Let me just take a step back and highlight a few comments that I made earlier this morning in terms of the challenges on the energy side and highlights the fact that, hey, maybe we\u2019d be at that 5% to 7% range, if you pulled out the coal that we acknowledged. Having said all that, on the international intermodal side, we said this publicly, we stated that we\u2019ve had a pretty significant win in the second half of the year, we\u2019re expecting that to continue to ramp on. We also have been encouraged by as the supply chain itself settles down that we should we believe we\u2019ll see more of those international boxes moved to a on dock type scenario versus being transported. So, on the international side, if the trade opens up, as consumer spending gets better, we would expect that that volume would increase. And as I stated earlier, the service product in that area has really improved and even as we sit today, it\u2019s a very strong service product. Jason Seidl : Okay. That\u2019s good color. Kenny, appreciate that. My follow up is going to be for Jennifer. Jennifer, you mentioned you guys got a little bit more conservative on the cash side with COVID. Clearly, ramping up, though, your share repurchase activity in 4Q, given the outlook for CapEx is relatively flat and it looks like you guys are looking to grow some of your profits here in 2021. How should we think about the share repurchase program? Are you guys going to try to play a little bit of catch up in 2021? Jennifer Hamann : So, thanks, Jason, for that question. In terms of catch up, we still have probably a little bit higher cash balance that we\u2019re carrying today at the $1.8 billion. So that gives us, I think, a good strong start into the year. And then we\u2019ll see how the rest of the year plays out. Certainly, as we talk at our Analyst Day in May, we\u2019re going to outline probably some more specific plans around not only our long-term outlook of the business performance, but then how we\u2019re going to deploy that that cash to shareholders. So we\u2019ll probably talk more in May. Jason Seidl : Okay. Appreciate the time as always. Everyone be safe out there. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jason. Same to you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Jennifer, I didn\u2019t hear any color around labor cost outlook for the year. Maybe if you can share some thoughts there. And I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out full year OR is typically pretty similar with what you do in the fourth quarter and the guidance implies something worse than that. So maybe it\u2019s on the labor side. And then if I can just bigger picture on the operating ratio, I know it\u2019s not a full year, you just sort of did that mid-50s OR with down revenue? Does that feel like the as good as it can get or do you feel like there\u2019s room for further improvement on that longer as you go out the next few years? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Well, let me take that last part first. I mean, you\u2019ve heard us say, Scott, that while we have the 55% target out there that we\u2019re still moving towards. We\u2019ve not said that that\u2019s an absolute endpoint. We still see opportunities ahead of us to continue to improve the efficiency. You\u2019ve heard, Eric, talk through some of that and we\u2019re very bullish. We\u2019re -- we think there\u2019s lots of opportunities ahead. So, again, those will be things that we talked more about in May. In terms of the statement about fourth quarter being a predication in terms of what our full year is going to be, I absolutely appreciate that optimism and confidence, and we feel very confident ourselves. But as you know, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes and there\u2019s variations. We did have a bit of a help from fuel in 2020 that we\u2019re not expecting in 2021. But it really is rooted in those three guidance levels that we gave you in terms of our volume, our pricing and productivity, if we can outperform on any of those categories versus our outlook today that would be upside certainly. Lance Fritz : Yeah. I want to re-emphasize that, Jennifer, that the guidance we gave is built on assumptions we outlined. And if those -- if we can make those assumptions better, we will. We want to grow faster the market. We\u2019re going to get as much productivity as we can. We\u2019re going to be relentless about efficiency. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And you also asked about the labor side, we\u2019re not giving specific labor cost inflation. If you -- if you\u2019re talking about kind of where we\u2019ve seen that elevated cost per employee, we do expect that to continue. We\u2019re going to continue to manage the workforce very tightly and we think that\u2019s the right decision overall to make. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. May be my question to be on the pricing side, so it sounds like there\u2019s an opportunity there on price and maybe particularly on the intermodal side. There\u2019s a setup I think in the truckload market that looks kind of similar to what we saw in 2018 in terms of inflationary pricing. So just wanted to get a sense of maybe what you think the opportunity is and maybe using \u201818 as a corollary, do you think we can get that type of acceleration in the core pricing side as we move forward and sort of where within the book of business, do you see the best opportunity? Kenny Rocker : So, first off, I just want to say that all starts with our service product, which allows us to really go out and compete and price to the marketplace, and so we\u2019re excited about the service product and where it is. Having said that, we\u2019re in January. We\u2019re in the early part of bid season. We\u2019ve gone through 15% to 20% of the bids out there. And what I would tell you is that, based on the tight supply, based on the tight market, there is a somewhat favorable opportunity for us in product in terms of that environment. We\u2019d much rather be in this environment than the loop environments you\u2019ve heard us talk about in \u201819 and first part of the \u201820. So we\u2019ll see how it plays. We\u2019ll have a little bit more clarity as we get through our bid season. But right now, it appears to be a favorable environment. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, I want to follow up with you. Obviously, some well publicized congestion issues, you guys had to surcharge to the fourth quarter, probably, couldn\u2019t take out as much business as you wanted to. We\u2019ve read you\u2019ve lifted the surcharge. Should we read that to mean that you have the confidence that not only can you keep up this pretty strong intermodal trip planned compliance, but there\u2019s also an opportunity for you to take some of the business that is been piling up in the West Coast that maybe weren\u2019t able to take in the fourth quarter and really grow the entire intermodal franchise at a greater pace than maybe otherwise without those issues? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. There\u2019s -- believe or not, there is a lot to unpack here. Let me take the surcharges first. So, first of all, those surcharges were in place for our customers that are in our MCP program. So I want to clarify that. We have a program where customers receive containers and we want to make sure those customers under that program receive those containers. During peak season, we ran into a scenario where we wanted to make sure those customers received them because of the high demand. Demand is tight right now, but it\u2019s not as tight as it was in the peak season. So we\u2019ve removed those surcharges and we want to go out there and grow. Let me pivot to another part of your comments around the congestion and just really break down what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplaces. A lot of the containers are coming off the water. Some of them are going on dock to buy rail, when I talked about that service product in great. Other parts of that business is going into warehouses out there and what you\u2019re seeing is some of those containers are out there, they are not turning some of the chassis they\u2019re not turning that\u2019s where that can shift and then the supply chain is going off. We\u2019re working with customer very closely. Eric is working with customers very closely. We\u2019ve made some changes to our accessorial charges to really incentivize and make sure that all customers in our supply chain get the service product. But again, as I stated, once we saw Union Pacific we\u2019ve done a just a fabulous job of executing that service product. Jon Chappell : All right. Thank you, Kenny. Very helpful. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a bit about where you think the network goes and what are -- from a terminal perspective and maybe it relates a little bit to the congestion? So are you planning -- are you complete with your terminal consolidation in Chicago? Are you still planning to do terminal consolidation in LA and intermodal? And then what should we think about in terms of metrics that would improve the most in 2021? You had great improvement in train lengths in 2020 and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind of a nice line up to the right. Does that continue with the same slope or are there other key PSR metrics that we should look at that may be improved more, given your focus on the operating side in 2021? Thank you. Eric Gehringer : Sure, Tom. Thanks for the question. So let\u2019s start with an update on Chicago. So our consolidation of intermodal ramps in Chicago is complete. We are working right now -- and the construction is complete. We\u2019re working right now here in the month of January to consolidate the G1 operation into G2. At the same time, we\u2019ve finished our consolidation of our two intermodal ramps in Houston and that\u2019s 100% complete. Now to your point, the efforts that we put forward looking at our terminals to drive increased efficiency, they never end. Just this month, in fact, with the investments we made in Englewood, we\u2019re rationalizing the hump that we have at Settegast. Now, we often talk on these calls about humps. But I think it\u2019s important to point out that when we think about terminal efficiency and continued gains, it\u2019s all of our terminals. So even if it doesn\u2019t have a hump, we still look for it, because in a PSR strategy and being a PSR railroad, you\u2019re still driven after safety to touch the cars less. So, even our non-hump terminals represent opportunities to touch the cars less by rationalizing out switching operations. We may use them for other operations like black swapping, but not for switching. So here in the fourth quarter, we stopped switching in Mason City, Iowa. We rationalized switching in El Paso, Texas. Now, again, to be very clear, those efforts will continue in 2021 and beyond. Now, regarding the metrics, you\u2019re going to watch the ones that we report, but of course, internally, we have many more metrics that we help us not only are lagging indicators, but leading indicators. I would leave you with on the car dwell and car velocity. Those are going to be your two biggest indicators of the benefits that we get by making improvements in our terminals, regardless of whether it\u2019s a hump or just a conventional classification here. Tom Wadewitz : Can you comment briefly on the LA question, whether you\u2019re going to do consolidation in terminals there or not? Eric Gehringer : Across the entire system, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities. We have a team out in the field. And here in Omaha that is very focused on constantly asking ourselves as we make changes, are there then additional opportunities based on those changes? So that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll guide you through today. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just following up on Tom\u2019s question about the intermodal network, you\u2019ve talked about some changes. But specifically, I think, a couple of the other rails have announced the development of a big logistics parks next to major intermodal terminals. I think the BN has a couple on their network. Is there any opportunity on the UP network for something like that, where you can sort of create these sticky long-term relationships with customers and really drive long-term share gain? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Allison, this is Lance. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Kenny for some detail. The short answer is yes and they do exist. We\u2019ve got a very large industrial park immediately adjacent to the Dallas Intermodal Terminal, where we\u2019ve talked to historically and it\u2019s alive and running about the Dallas to dock plastics product. So, yeah, there are opportunities like that and we do search for ways to use our real estate to the benefit of the railroad and that\u2019s happening all the time. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I appreciate that question. I tell you what, if you look at our network today, I\u2019m glad you asked it, because we haven\u2019t talked about it quite a bit. But we have 11 rail ports that are out there. You look at the major terminal like, whether it\u2019s Los Angeles, whether that\u2019s Houston, whether it\u2019s Dallas, even if you look at the Chicago area. We already have rail ports in those major areas that we align, trying to take trucks off the road and complement it with the intermodal network or carload network for that matter. So we\u2019re doing that today. I don\u2019t want anyone to leave with the impression that that\u2019s not occurring today. There are more opportunities for us to go out there and be aggressive and you\u2019re seeing some of that with the Twin Cities intermodal terminal. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Yes. Good morning. In the last two years, you\u2019ve increased your train length by roughly 30% and I believe you said the volumes down and there were period where we\u2019re about 9% on a daily basis. So that\u2019s considerable progress. I was just curious, when we think about the model of growing merchandise traffic and adding new revenue cars to existing train starts and the typically high incremental margins that come with that. Has that calculus been changed a little bit as far as how much capacity is left to go, as hopefully the industrial economy recovers or is there still a lot of runway to continue that historic relationship that you typically see when industrial traffic recovers? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Bascome, this is Jennifer. I would say that we have not changed our enthusiasm around that. And if anything, I think is we\u2019re continuing to find ways to not only build train length, but combine the different types of traffic that are moving on our train. That gives us further opportunity to do that. So those are things that were definitely have been doing and we will continue to do and I think it drives very favorable results as you saw in the fourth quarter. Lance Fritz : Yeah. And Bascome if you were kind of part of your question, I thought I heard, is there a limit to train length at some point in the future? I think, Eric had mentioned, we\u2019re going to continue to find train length and plan for finding train length opportunity through 2021. Part of that reflected in our capital plan for another 20 siding extensions or new sidings. And so we don\u2019t see an end to that yet either. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Good morning. Great job on the operating ratio, but, Jen, I think there\u2019s a little bit of confusion if you could just clarify your comment on the first quarter? Is it going to be worse year-over-year? Is it just tough? Just maybe some clarification, because I think there\u2019s some confusion on your comments and thoughts? And then just a follow up on that last one, the siding length, you\u2019re only building half the number of new sidings this year versus last year, so 20 versus 36? Should we expect deceleration on that progress or is there anything -- any comment about the deceleration there? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Let me start with the OR question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric to talk to you about sidings. So my commentary is that, we are going to have a little bit tougher comparison here in the first quarter, and again, I\u2019m talking year-over-year, just because of the mix headwinds that we\u2019re facing. Not saying that we can improve it. Just saying that you need to take into that that mix headwinds as you\u2019re looking at the calculus with the down industrial volumes, particularly less crude oil, but hopefully, we\u2019re continuing to see strong grain and that will help and you saw what green certainly did in terms of helping that business mix profile in the fourth quarter. So that was my commentary, Ken. Eric Gehringer : Ken, I would say\u2026 Ken Hoexter : Okay. Eric Gehringer : Ken, I appreciate the question, when you think about the siding and doing 20 versus 36, I would not read into that as an intentional deceleration. What I would read into it is we\u2019re being very judicious with working through the process that we have used over the last two years to truly understand where are the largest opportunities and then making the investment when we need it. We still want to continue to challenge ourselves, though, that growing train length does not necessarily all about capital investments. Jennifer briefly mentioned and I will elaborate, some of its just process. We have, for example, trackers today that are really more data analytics, that help us to see hours in advance of a combination opportunity where we can take two trains and put them together. We can see that five hours, six hours in advance, sometimes even longer. And what that allows us to do is for the local team to prepare for that, and then also, for example, our Harriman Dispatch Center to ensure that we have resources up against that. So we\u2019re seeing the railroad with better clarity than we have ever before and you are going to continue to see us grow train length, but it\u2019s not always going to be driven by capital investment alone. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, following on that line of thought there, you guys are keeping CapEx flat again, obviously, some spare capacity in the network, like, you\u2019re talking about there. But I guess, how sustainable do you see this equation, keeping CapEx around these levels continuing to grow volume? Isn\u2019t there\u2019s some point at which physical capacity would be required? And I guess just as a quick follow on to that too, how are you guys keeping D&A flat this year, if you don\u2019t mind? Lance Fritz : So let me start on the capital and then we\u2019ll turn it over to either Jennifer or Eric on the second part. So when we think about capital and long-term looking into the future, we\u2019ve created quite a bit of excess capacity or open capacity through PSR and unified plan. And nothing would please us more than to have enough volume growth to justify investing more capital. You look at our ROIC, we -- every dollar that we put in the ground generating 15% plus, we love that. But we just don\u2019t need it, given the amount of capacity that we have at hand, the way we\u2019re running the railroad today. So, Brandon, it\u2019s very difficult to look out into the future and say, boy, at this date, certain we will need to turn on more growth capital. It\u2019s going to depend on where the car loads are in the network, how much they are, but again, when we do face that question, that\u2019s a very good day for us. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And I think it\u2019s important to note that in the 29 [ph] that we -- roughly that we spent in 2020 and we\u2019re going to spend again there in 2021. We\u2019re making investments for growth in there. That\u2019s not all maintenance CapEx and you think about some of the investments that we\u2019re doing in the terminals and intermodal facilities in Chicago, in Houston, that\u2019s going to support growth. So I think you need to keep that in mind too. Going back to your question on D&A being flat? I guess I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking that. Were you asking that in terms of how do we do that in 2020? How are we doing that in 2021? Could you maybe clarify that a little bit? Brandon Oglenski : Oh! Sorry. I think you said D&A would be flat this year, right? Jennifer Hamann : D&A, I\u2019m sorry. Brandon Oglenski : Yeah. Jennifer Hamann : Can\u2019t help. Sorry, I thought you said, G&A. Depreciation expense, so as you know, we do studies every year in terms of looking at some rail life and I think we\u2019ve got a little bit of favorable news there on rail and that\u2019s helping us out a little bit on the depreciation side. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Lance and Kenny, I guess, I just wanted to ask about growth. Because I think from here, growth and -- I guess, growth alone is what will allow the company to kind of realize the full benefits of all the changes with respect to the operations and the network. And I guess I\u2019m not just talking about a rising tide, easy comps, cyclical recovery, but rather kind of above market growth and market share wins. And I think it would be fair to say that, the last decade was not characterized by growth, but rather maybe pricing and return. So you have a better network, a leaner network, I just love to get a sense of how are you going to pivot the business and the culture of the company towards growth? And maybe even just give us some tangible examples, because I think you have the market share wins, but if you could just provide a little bit more clarity on those? Lance Fritz : That\u2019s an excellent question. You\u2019re exactly right, that we are in the process of turning our sites to -- while continuing to improve our margins and yields to add to that more strengthen the growth leg of the stool. And Kenny, you\u2019ve got a couple of things culturally that you\u2019ve done inside the commercial organization. It\u2019s not all just about the commercial organization in terms of supporting growth. But I think they\u2019re indicative of where we\u2019re going. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019ll tell you, we have a number of commodities that will grow and we still have to compete. We still have to go out there and compete against trucks and other modes to go out there and win that business. We have good line of sight of those. We feel good about it. I like your word choice of culturally. I\u2019ll tell you our teams were very excited about where we are. We\u2019ve changed our compensation program, so that we can motivate the sales team to go out there and win. We want to make sure that they are spending their energy and focus on carload growth. And I can tell you that the leadership team here at the table with me, we\u2019re all supportive and they\u2019re all committed to that carload growth. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say we had really good clarity on what those goals are transparency, on what it\u2019s like to win and really clear metrics that support growth. But behind it, we have things like ensuring that there\u2019s good, not necessarily margins, but that we\u2019re winning with the right kind of margins and we\u2019ve achieved the right kind of price. So it\u2019s all baked in there to just motivate the team and we expect that to be a great cultural change\u2026 Amit Mehrotra : Yeah. Kenny Rocker : \u2026for us. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, you\u2019ve changed your work structure to streamline it. You\u2019ve distributed business development goals to more broad than just each salesperson. Everybody on your team has business development responsibility. Amit, there\u2019s just example after example of fundamental changes that have been put in place in 2020 that we think are going to drive growth in 2021 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the end market commentary for 2021. But I think one of the end markets missing there was international intermodal. Apologies if I missed this. But can you address kind of what do you see in terms of trends there given that that was one of the markets that really was -- was really volatile in 2020? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Again, the big things we\u2019re looking at is consumer spending and trade there, the timing of the vaccination, adoption of the vaccination. We expect to have a direct impact on those international intermodal volumes. As the demand we believe we will be sustained. We feel good about the service product. We feel good about our interaction with our customers and the processes that they\u2019ve adopted to allow us to efficiently grow there. So all of that going into 2021 we believe will be a positive for us. Ravi Shanker : Good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. I would love to circle back to that growth question. Just in terms of, I would love to hear your perspective on technology as an enabler of that growth? Are you looking at it more as sort of a productivity enhancer or is there more opportunity on sort of reliability and service in terms of gaining that share back, any thoughts? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Let me start with that and then I think everybody on the team might have a perspective. The first thing I want to note is our most recent addition to the senior leadership team with Rahul Jalali, who joined us as our CIO. I think it was in early November last year. He\u2019s bringing fresh energy and perspective to the team. And Allison, we think about the role of technology, all of the above, in terms of what you asked about it, it definitely plays a role in growth, in terms of customer experience, in terms of us developing platforms and ecosystems for our customers to participate in and resolving their needs from their perspective. There\u2019s been a real juice applied to that in recent months. And we\u2019re going to continue to use technology to enhance efficiency and productivity. UP vision is a great example of that getting something a minimum -- of minimally viable product in the hands of our operations team and then developing it on the fly into a very, very strong productivity tool today. But Kenny and Eric, you guys are the ones experiencing it. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I would tell you, we certainly want to take advantage of it from a commercial standpoint to go out there and make it easier for customers to do business with us with again pointing towards growth. So, yes, we have a number of visibility tools that our customers are using, so they can see what\u2019s coming to them at their plant either on the UP or offline. We\u2019ve certainly talked about the usage of API\u2019s before and it\u2019s opened up markets for us and I mean, literally, we\u2019ve been able to go out there and win business with having API\u2019s in our tool kit. Again, we\u2019ve done a great job of expanding that customer engagement with the API capabilities. I\u2019ve been encouraged to Lance\u2019s comments with Rahul coming on Board. And he really have a vision for helping us remove pain points that the customer might have through IT. And then lastly, just to set up, Eric here, from a visibility standpoint, we certainly utilize technology to see what\u2019s common to us. So a good example of that is, the containers that are heading into the West Coast port. We have a better handle and more clarity now of what at the port, what\u2019s coming to the point port and we utilize that to leverage to come up with a good strong solid service product. Eric Gehringer : So, Allison, Lance and Kenny have both highlighted tools and technology that allows us to see our railroads that. What I\u2019m very excited about on top of all that is we have made tremendous strides in technology on how we execute on our railroad. So if you think about, for example, the upgrade with our implementation of our CATX [ph] system at the Harriman Dispatch Center. This drives not only more fluidity, but it drives improved customer service. When I look at what our engineering department and mechanical departments are doing to reinvent the way they do their work, whether it\u2019s to occupy less time or whether it\u2019s to do the work in a more efficient manner, there are almost a countless number of initiatives that relate to technology that are driving that and you\u2019ll see that continue in 2021 and beyond. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but I was hoping that you could expand a little bit on the outlook for your grain franchise, including where export flows stand now relative to normal and where do you think on farm inventory stand? Kenny Rocker : Now, those are a couple good questions, Cherilyn. I appreciate that. You know right now we\u2019re kind of in the early innings and so what I tell you is that for this quarter, Jennifer mentioned that, and it\u2019s still pretty early innings and but it looks like grain in the near-term will hold up. And so we\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019re working with our customers very closely to get forecasts on that. I\u2019ll tell you, though, in the back half of the year, the comps get a lot tougher. However, that will still be a very strong 2021. So you want to keep that in perspective. I think the back -- last part of your question is just around inventory. We feel good about the fact that there\u2019s still quite a bit of grain out there. We\u2019ve saw the grain inventory decrease about 10% year-over-year. We\u2019re expecting a pretty strong crop. With that, we feel good about that demand being sustained. So, Eric, and his team will deliver that and our commercial team will then engage to maximize as many shuttles as we can get. Lance Fritz : And Cherilyn, I would add, current demand is being large -- from export perspective being largely driven by China and China\u2019s entry back into the U.S. bean market, partly reflecting the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal, partly reflecting a basically recovered hog herd in domestic China. So what China does through the year is really going to kind of predicate what happens in the second half of the year in terms of export grain. Kenny Rocker : That\u2019s right on Lance. I mean, you got that dynamic. Some of our customers have talked about -- talk to us about Brazil and whether or not there\u2019s a drought down there that might impact the demand. But I can tell you, we\u2019re focused on executing and getting as much grain business as we can export out of the country if we can. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Thank you. Good morning. So one more question on growth, Lance, you talked in the press release about taking share of the freight transportation market. I want to ask if you could provide some more context around that, sounds like we need to do to get there is a bit of a mix of infrastructure, service technology and then focus from the sales team. But where do you see the biggest opportunities, are they, like, coal or commodity type? And do you think this is something you can actually quantify when we get to the Analyst Day in May? And then I guess on a related point, typically we think about some of the conversion opportunities coming with that as a neutral and negative mix. Appreciate can you just comments about the system and the margin accretive, but how do you reconcile the two kind of what we\u2019ve seen in the past versus what you are targeting is that more of a density play or is it better service and better pricing? So putting some context around that would be appreciated. Lance Fritz : Okay. Brian, so let me try to unpack that and I\u2019ll try to do that holistically. So the question being around growing our share of the freight market and what does that mean? And you\u2019ve asked some questions around the implications of mix and what it takes to win and what gives us confidence. So when we talk about growing our share of the freight market, we are deliberately broad, because we\u2019re focused, first and foremost, on converting trucks from highway. Inside of that we\u2019re looking for commodities that are under penetrated to train and have the dynamic where they should be -- we should see greater share overall of train penetrating freight. And also customers, they used to ship on us and don\u2019t anymore trying to unpack why and what we can do about that and new markets that are opening up to us, both because of our service product and our cost structure. So, we\u2019re deliberately broad because there the target markets are deliberately broad. In terms of what it takes, it takes an excellent service product and for most customers perspective that\u2019s reliability and consistency. There\u2019s also a safety and an ESG component there. Many of our customers look to us to help them meet some of their commitments to their shareholders and stakeholders in terms of their carbon footprint. So there\u2019s that. It also takes us having a deep knowledge of the marketplace through Kenny\u2019s commercial team. That\u2019s, that\u2019s the secret sauce of the commercial team is understanding many markets deeply, deeply enough to understand what it takes to win. And then we\u2019ve got to have service products designed that do that that means the needs of our customers. And you\u2019ve got it partly right, I think, maybe even largely right and that is, as we grow, looking forward, a lot of that looks like it\u2019s going to go into the intermodal product and our intermodal product, everything else equal tends to mix us down. Now having said that, our intermodal product is also becoming more profitable over time and we\u2019re not going to stop on that initiative. And we\u2019re also very, very confident in our ability to leverage growth through productivity. So you put that all together and bottomline what it says is, we\u2019re going to continue to use all three legs of the stool to make future margin generation better than today. And our confidence coming out of 2020 has really never been higher being able to do that. Brian Ossenbeck : Got it. Thank you, Lance. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. David Ross : Yes. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to touch on Mexico for a little bit. Commentary on the growth you\u2019re expecting in 2021 in the Mexico business versus the U.S. business, should it be better or should it be worse, but the same? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So thanks for bringing that up. First of all, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the fact that, that Mexico business, we\u2019ve got a significant percentage of that tied to the automotive network and we\u2019re seeing that comeback, which is encouraging to us. We\u2019re also seeing some areas like the Mexico Energy Reform, the combat area or pipeline for growth for us. As I look at some of the wins that we\u2019ve had, to Lance\u2019s comments around that truck business, really Mexico as an area where we have to go after and grow the pieces of business that were over the road that we haven\u2019t won before. So we are encouraged about Mexico. At the same time, if you look at it as a whole, Mexico is still under penetrated, once you walk out thought of that automotive network and so we\u2019ve been working with customers and supply chain partners to see what we can do to untap some of those markets. So we\u2019re pretty encouraged about Mexico and what it has both for 2021 and long-term. David Ross : Got you. Lance Fritz : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much, Operator. So I want to take a little bit more cautious question around the growth or cautious angle to the growth question. When other PSR railroads or other railroads have converted to PSR, they\u2019ve noted, obviously, a very significant service improvement that\u2019s led to the ability to grow share very, very strongly, especially if they\u2019re up against the non-PSR railroad, as you are. My question, therefore is, does that -- what is the capacity of your organization to grow? Are there any capacity issues that you\u2019ve identified that you need to address in order to accommodate that growth and are you -- when we seen other railroads tempted to go down rather unconventional paths toward growth, acquiring another market? So what are your thoughts around kind of not the pure rail related growth opportunities, but going down some of those other routes, your view on that be appreciated as well? Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Walter, let me take a stab at that and maybe Jennifer wants to add to my comments. Thank you very much for the question. So when we think about growth and using our service product to grow? I -- absent some surprising very regionalized response, I think we\u2019ve got good capacity around the network. We\u2019ve got the ability to react to growth as it\u2019s occurring, if we need to add to whatever our capacity is. And I candidly, I just look forward, and I don\u2019t see even in some strong growth, I don\u2019t see a surprise to us that would cause us alarm. I think our processes, our mechanisms for seeing growth as it\u2019s occurring, know where it\u2019s happening, being deliberate about what we\u2019re going after. I really think the network is on very good footing. So that\u2019s the -- what is needed in a capacity perspective. In terms of the part of your question about what elements are you thinking about growth when it comes to non-traditional? Unpacking we think of three ways to grow. The first is put carloads to fit the network that are profitable on the network. Clearly, that\u2019s a step one and the most favored way to grow because it\u2019s got great incremental margins and it uses capacity that\u2019s available. Another way for us to grow is to do more for our customers, perform more function for them in their supply chains logistics. And that\u2019s always an opportunity and we\u2019re working on that, because it also helps make customers stickier with us. We\u2019re providing greater value to them and in the process solving their problems, whatever their addressable problems are for us. Then the third way that we think about growth is increasing the geographical footprint. We\u2019ve been pretty clear that when we think about that from a class one merger perspective that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for regulation to destroy value in that process. And so far, the economics just don\u2019t look like they pencil out. But that\u2019s not the only way to increase our geographic footprint. We can do it through, one of the earlier questions, how do we use our real estate to increase our reach maybe through incremental transit loads or incremental logistics parts. So, yeah, Walter, we\u2019re thinking about all three, all three have action against them and I think we\u2019ll probably get into a bit more detail on that when it comes to the Investor Day. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And Walter, just to quickly kind of put a bow on it. I mean, I think, that\u2019s what you\u2019re touching on is what we see as the great leverage and great opportunity that\u2019s ahead of us is to grow in a less capital intensive manner over the next period of time. When you think about the locomotive assets that we can deploy, the freight cars, the track capacity, the ability to redeploy terminals if we need to, I mean, those are all great new storage for us to the extent that we start deploying those assets and we see a future where we will be deploying those assets. I think that\u2019s the real value and the leverage that we have ahead of us. Walter Spracklin : Makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A question just on the revenue per carload yield, I heard what you\u2019re saying about the first quarter and fourth quarter. Just sort of wondering from a context standpoint, I get the headwind. Can you sort of put that in context of the minus 4% you did in the fourth quarter? Could it look better versus that? Are we talking the same order of magnitude? And that sort of the second part of it is, in terms of the second quarter and third quarter when industrials set to most likely inflect positive, could there be a period where mix becomes a tailwind in 2021? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Jordan, I think, you\u2019re thinking of it right. So if we think about revenue per unit or arc, just flat revenue in the first quarter, you heard us say that we\u2019re looking at low single-digit growth on a volume standpoint. But we are going to continue to have a pretty strong fuel headwind in the first quarter as we did through much of 2020. Right now we\u2019re paying call it a $60 or so a gallon for fuel. I think we paid close to a $90 in the first quarter of last year. So just that fuel surcharge revenue is going to be a driver there in terms of the revenue per unit, you all see that and then obviously the mix. With the industrial car loadings continuing to be down, that\u2019s our highest average revenue per car unit type of business and so that creates a headwind. We\u2019re bullish on the grain and feel good about that. So, we\u2019ll look to move as much of that as we possibly can. But there is going to be [Technical Difficulty]. I think as you also talk the second half to the second and third quarters, we have opportunities. Kenny talks about an improving price environment. You\u2019re going to have that headwind abate relative to the year-over-year fuel change and then if we can get some growth on an industrial side, that could be great news as well. Jordan Alliger : Just follow up quickly on that on the arc for intermodal, which I guess has been running a bit negative. Is there mixed stuff going on there too is, does that have a chance to better pricing to move in a positive direction in the upcoming quarters? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. I mean, again, as you know, there\u2019s mix within mix. So within intermodal, you have both international and domestic, and there are differences there and then as part of that premium group, overall, automotive is in there. And automotive obviously is a big part of that, when you see those volumes down year-over-year and intermodal growing. Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question this morning is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning. And on this topic of kind of catalyzing growth, Lance, when I look at the performance metrics page and the trip plan compliance is specifically like 83% for intermodal, 74% for manifest. I think one of the easiest levers you could have to take more share would be to improve those metrics. I guess I\u2019m looking for some perspective on how satisfied you are with the trip plan compliance today. How does that compare to your primary competitor in the West? And then what can you do to drive those metrics up, because I would think that would be one of the easier paths towards maximizing your share with existing -- with customers? Lance Fritz : That\u2019s a great question, David. So we are not satisfied with our KPIs. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made and we think they are good in the marketplace and position us to be able to compete for and win business. But we also think there\u2019s some upside in terms of improvement. Having said that, 100% is not an outcome. That\u2019s reasonable that that\u2019s actually likely or even optimal. In the railroad environment, the way we measure trip plan compliance, whether it\u2019s for the intermodal product or manifest and autos. What we have said and do think, is that we can get that intermodal trip plan compliance into the high 80%s and low 90%s and have it sit there, and if we can get the manifest and autos into the 80% ballpark and low 80%s and have it sit there, that\u2019s a sweet spot, balancing out resources and fulfilling a consistent reliable service product that supports the needs of our customers. So there is a bit of an upside there, David. I wouldn\u2019t hang my hat on that\u2019s going to generate 2x and 3x and 4x growth. What that does is it continues to set us up to compete effectively. And we\u2019re already really set to compete effectively against our primary rail competition and we\u2019ve got a lot of work underway with some delivery on being able to compete effectively with truck. David Vernon : And is there any sort of tension between trip plan client\u2019s number and train lines, I guess, like operationally, I would think that there might be a little bit of tension there. But I mean, this is a situation where we are right now or where we\u2019re maximizing efficiency and maybe leaving some growth on the table. Is that the way to think about it or is that not the way we to think about it? Lance Fritz : No. I wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to think about it, David. Although you\u2019re right that, we have moved virtually all, I think all of our critical operating KPIs in 2020 favorably in comparison to 2019, both the efficiency and productivity measures and the service measures. So we\u2019ve demonstrated we can move them both in the same direction. It\u2019s not easy, right? That\u2019s not a layup. Because if we don\u2019t think about our network right, we can get into a place where we\u2019re making those false trade-offs between productivity and efficiency and the service product. I label them false trade-off because I think they are, if we think about our network, right, we can do the hard work on both. David Vernon : All right. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Now I\u2019ll hand the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz, for any closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. We look forward to talking with you again in April, when we discuss our first quarter 2021 results. Until then, I wish all of you good health and safety, and please take care. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you and good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kenny rocker, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before discussing first quarter results, I want to recognize our employees for their work during the major winter events we experienced in February and early March. Many of the communities we serve faced unprecedented weather conditions that damaged factories and made surface transportation nearly impossible. Our employees rose to the occasion to maintain or restore critical service in those areas while dealing with weather impacts art to their own homes and families. We owe a debt of gratitude to our team as they again proved the resiliency, their grid and their dedication to serve. Moving on first quarter results, this morning Union Pacific is reporting 2021 first quarter net income of $1.3 billion or $2 a share. This compares to $1.5 billion or $2.15 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 60.1%, reflecting the impact of weather and rising fuel prices in the quarter. As you will hear from the team, and see these items, our core results improved 150 basis points. We delivered strong productivity in very challenging conditions and based on our core performance, I remain optimistic about the remainder of the year. In fact we are affirming our 2021 guidance. While it was a tough quarter, that does not dampen our expectations. We're in a terrific position to take advantage of the improving economic outlook and grow our volume. Our service product, our cost structure and continuing productivity set us up for an outstanding year. To get us started reviewing the details, I will turn it over to Eric for an operations update. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. The operating team rose to the challenge of this past quarter as it responded to numerous weather challenges across the network. The speed with which the team recovered the network is a testament to the transformation PSR has had on our operations. Moving to Slide 4, we began 2021 with strong key performance indicators across the rough board as the operations were solid and running smooth in January. However, the winter weather challenges we faced in February and March across our network had a heavy impact. The South in particular is not accustomed to the whether they faced. In fact, the weather across our southern region represented the second worst stretch of cold temperatures in over 70 years. Through the team's hard work our network recovered quickly, and we were able to mitigate, most of the impact to our service. In fact, we recovered twice as fast compared to our recovery from the flooding in 2019 and significantly faster than any disruptions we experienced before implementation of PSR. While the operating team is frustrated with the mixed results you see on Slide 4, we will return all of these measures to a state of constant improvement through execution of our transportation plan. Weather heavily impacted the results you see in freight car velocity, freight car terminal dwell and train speed. However, we continue to make good progress on our efficiency measures as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. These improvements were driven by our continual evaluation and adjustment of our transportation plan as well as through our continued efforts to grow train link. Intermodal trip plan compliance decreased in the quarter as weather and a surge in intermodal shipments of 12% year-over-year placed significant pressure on that service. Our manifest service remained solid during the quarter, driving improvement in trip plan compliance for manifest and autos. The team did an excellent job of maintaining this service product throughout the weather impact. Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. We continue to push train length to drive productivity while striving to provide a better service product to our customers. Train length was almost 9,250 feet in the first quarter, which was up 10% or 850ft year over year. One enabler of this great progress is our siding extension program. During the quarter, we completed two sidings and began construction or the bidding process, and another 18 sidings. We continue to make progress in the redesign of our operations in the Houston area to drive efficiency. We are leveraging the recent investment of our Englewood facility and we consolidated the blocking of local cars at our Settegast yard, allowing us to curtail operations at four of our smaller yards around the area. This allows us to bypass those smaller yards and deliver cars directly to the customers, eliminating extra handlings, improving transit time and reducing crew start. We also curtailed switching operations at our North Council Bluffs yard by leveraging surrounding yards, which will reduce local train starts. As I look to the future, I'm excited about the full pipeline of initiatives we have to drive productivity throughout our network and enhance our service product. Turning to Slide 6; everything we do is done with the focus towards safely accomplishing our work. We understand the continuous improvement we need to make and safety, and we have the right plan to achieve our goal. We remain focused on executing on the PSR principles that transformed our operation and there still remain many opportunities for us to improve our operations and drive productivity we have work to do to return our service product to the level we expect. We need to return intermodal trip plan compliance to the mid to upper '80s, manifest trip plan compliance to the low to mid '70s and freight car velocity, the low '20s. We're on that path today as we fully recognize the importance of providing our customers with a highly reliable service product. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Our first quarter volume was down 1% from a year ago due to weather events and the leap year in 2020. Solid gains in our intermodal on export grain markets were offset by declines in our industrial and energy related market. Freight revenue was down 5% for the quarter due to the decrease in volume, coupled with the lower fuel surcharge and negative business mix that offset...that were offset by our core pricing. Let's take a closer look at how each of our business groups performed in the first quarter. Starting with our bulk markets, revenue for the quarter was down 1%, volume decreased by 2%, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in average revenue per car, due to the positive mix in traffic and core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads were down 16% as a result of continued high customer inventory levels, our contract law and weather-related challenges, which were partially offset by higher natural gas prices. Volume for grain and grain products was up 16%, driven by increased demand for export grain. Fertilizer carloads were down 4% as reduced export potash shipments were partially offset by stronger demand for industrial sulfur. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was down 6%, driven primarily by decreased demand for food service due to the ongoing pandemic as well as weather related challenges. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue declined 13% for the quarter, driven by an 11% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 1% from a lower fuel surcharge and mix. Energy and specialized shipment decreased 14% primarily driven by reduced crude oil shipments due to unfavorable price drag and reduced demand. Forest products volume grew by 7%, lumber was driven by strong housing starts, along with an increase in repair and remodel. We also saw strength in brown paper, driven by increased box demand and low inventory. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 9% for the quarter, due to the severe storm in May and February that cost plant interruptions for producers throughout the Gulf Coast as well as feedstock shortages in certain sectors. Metals and minerals volume was down 16% primarily driven by weather and market softness in rock coupled with reduced frac sand shipments associated with the decline in drilling and surplus in local sand. Turning now to premium, revenue for the quarter was up 2% on a 6% increase in volume. Average revenue per car declined by 4% reflecting mix effect from greater container volumes and fewer automotive carload shipment. Automotive volume was down 13% for the quarter as manufacturers struggled with semiconductor-related part shortages and extreme winter weather disruptions to the supply chain. Finished vehicle and auto parts shipments were impacted similarly with finished vehicles, down 13% and auto part, down 14%. Intermodal volume increased by 12% in the quarter. Domestic intermodal was up 16% year-over-year due to continued strength in retail sales in recent business land parcel in particular benefited from ongoing strength and e-commerce. International intermodal volume grew 8% despite poor congestion related to strong growth in containerized import. Now looking ahead to the rest of 2021, for our bulk commodities, we expect a continued negative outlook for coal, electricity demand and natural gas prices are forecasted to improve have high customer inventory levels, combined with increased demand for other energy sources and a contract law presents a challenging market. However, there is continued strength for export grain as China remains committed to incremental ag product purchases in 2021 calendar year, with clearly a tougher year-over-year comparison in the back half of the year. We also are optimistic with our biofuel shipments as domestic production is expected to increase, which will drive new volume at new UP destination facility for bulk renewable diesel feedstocks and finished products. As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable however, there is still uncertainty with the speed of the recovery in those markets. We are encouraged by the stronger forecast for industrial production. Full year 2021 is now forecasted at 6.5%, a 2% point improvement since we spoke in January. Plastic volumes will also remain strong for us in 2021 as production rates increase. And lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift in both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to closer to $16 million in 2021. We are optimistic that automotive production will normalize and supply chain issue for parts are expected to improve later in the second quarter. With regard to intermodal, Limited truck capacity we're encouraged conversion from over the road truck to rail. Retail inventories remain historically low, restocking of inventory along with continued strength in sales should drive intermodal volumes, higher this year. Before I hand this over to Jennifer, I'd like to express my appreciation to our operating and engineering teams for their hard work and dedication to keep our network running in the unprecedented weather event in February and March. Both our commercial and operating teams work closely together to quickly recover operations for our customers and win new bit. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks. Kenny and good morning, I'm going to start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2 and a quarterly operating ratio of 60.1%. Comparing our first quarter results 2020 the extreme winter weather previously discussed negatively impacted our operating ratio by 160 basis points or $0.16 to earnings. In addition, rising fuel prices throughout the quarter and the associated 2-month lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs impacted our quarterly ratio by 100 basis points or $0.11 per share. Despite these challenges, our core operations and profitability continued to improve, delivering 150 basis points of benefit to our operating ratio and adding $0.12 earnings per share. Looking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14, operating revenue totaled $5 billion, down 4% versus 2020 on a 1% year-over-year volume decrease. Operating expense decreased 3% to $3 billion demonstrating our consistent ability to adjust costs more than volume. Taken together, we are reporting first quarter operating income of $2 billion, a 7% decrease versus last year. Interest expense increased 4% compared to 2020 resulting from an increase in fees related to our debt exchange with some offset from lower weighted average debt level, income tax decreased 7% due to lower pre-tax income, net income of $1.3 billion decreased 9% versus 2020 which when combined with share repurchases resulted in earnings per share of $2, down 7%. Looking more closely at first quarter revenue; Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue which totaled $4.6 billion, down 5% compared to 2020. Factoring in weather and last year being a leap year, the volume impact on freight revenue was a 75 basis point decrease. Fuel surcharge negatively impacted freight revenue by 200 basis points compared to last year. The decrease was driven by the lag and fuel surcharge recovery as well as slightly lower fuel prices. Our pricing actions continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation. However, those gains were more than offset by a negative business mix and reduced freight revenue 225 basis points. Although our grain shipments increased in the quarter, this impact was more than offset by very strong intermodal volumes coupled with declines in petroleum and industrial product shipments. Now let's move on to Slide 16 which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. Starting with compensation and benefits expense down 3% year-over-year. First quarter workforce levels declined 12% or about 4100 full-time equivalent generating very strong productivity against only a 1% decrease in volume. Specifically, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 11%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 13%. Offsetting some of this productivity was an elevated cost per employee, up 10% as we tightly managed headcount-based wage inflation and higher year-over-year incentive compensation as well as higher weather-related crew costs. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 5%, a result of lower volume and prices. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat as productivity initiatives were offset by the additional fuel needed as a result of the extremely cold temperatures. Purchased services and materials expense improved 6% driven by our loop subsidiary utilizing less drayage as a result of lower auto volumes as well as maintenance costs related to a smaller active equipment fleet. These savings were partially offset by additional weather-related expenses. Equipment and other rents fell 7% driven by higher equity income from our ownership in TTS. The other expense line increased 22 million this quarter driven by higher casualty expenses that were primarily related to adverse developments on certain claims. This increase should not be viewed as an indicator of current safety record. As we think about expenses going forward recall that last year in the second and 3rd quarters. We took temporary actions in response to the pandemic reducing management salaries and closing shop. These actions produce a 2% headwind in total for second quarter expenses predominantly impacting compensation and benefits and purchased services and material expenses, and for a full-year comparison excluding, we now expect both purchased services and materials as well as other expense to be up mid-single digits versus 2020. Lastly, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be slightly higher than previously thought, around 24% looking now at productivity on Slide 17, in spite of the $35 million weather headwind, we continue our solid productivity trend in the first quarter generating $105 million. Productivity results were led again by train length improvement contributing to strong workforce and locomotive productivity as Eric detailed earlier. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flow, cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $2 billion from $2.2 billion in 2020, a 9% decline despite that free cash flow after capital investments increased 5% to over $1.4 billion, highlighting our ongoing capital discipline as well as a slightly slower start to our capital programs. This generated a cash flow conversion rate of 106%. Free cash flow after dividends also increased in the quarter, up $115 million or 17%. Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances we returned $2 billion to shareholders during the first quarter as we maintained our industry-leading dividend payout and repurchase shares totaling 1.4 billion. We finished the first quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times on par with year-end 2020. Wrapping up on Slide 19; despite the slow start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to show improvement across all three performance drivers' volume, price and productivity, we do face some volume headwinds declining coal demand the lingering impact of industrial, chemical plant closures from the February storm and the semiconductor shortage that is continuing to impact autos into the second quarter. Setting that aside though, there are even more reasons to be encouraged about '21. The pace of vaccination rollouts, strong consumer and trade demand, and an improving industrial production forecast. And we are increasingly optimistic about our ability to drive business to the railroad. Since early March, we have seen an improving demand trajectory with March averaging roughly a 157,000 seven-day car loadings and we crossed the 160,000 plus threshold in April. So with the strength we're seeing in our volumes, we now expect full year carload growth to be around 6%. Our guidance around full-year pricing, productivity and operating ratio improvement in the range of 150 to 200 basis points, all remain intact. However, with our updated volume outlook, we will likely be closer to the 200 than the 150. We clearly have work ahead of us to achieve these goals. But a broader economic picture and good traction on our PSR initiatives, give us a path to success. Turning to cash and capital, our capital spending plan remains at $2.9 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue as we generate capacity through our PSR focus. We will maintain our industry-leading dividend payout ratio and are committed to strong share repurchases. Specifically, we plan to return approximately $6 billion to our shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to add my thanks to our exceptional workforce. Mother Nature tested our capabilities this quarter and once again our workforce showed they are ready for the challenges and are committed to serving our customers. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As you've heard me say many times, our first priority will always be see, I'm confident in our ability to meet our high expectations in that area. With today being Earth Day it feels appropriate to highlight the actions we're taking to protect our planet. In February, we announced our science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26% against the 2018 base by 2030. Additionally in our 2021 proxy statement we rolled out our ESG strategy, which we call building a sustainable future 2030, we will expand on this strategy in our 2020 building America report, which is going to be published in early May in conjunction with our Investor Day. We're reinforcing our commitment to delivering value to all of our stakeholders. As you heard today, we're very optimistic about the future. Our service product made more resilient through PSR and lower cost structure is enabling us to win new business and expand opportunities that will ultimately grow the top line. Looking to the rest of the year and improving economic outlook, our continued commitment to value-based pricing that exceeds inflation and the opportunity for strong productivity gives us confidence to affirm our 2021 guidance. Union Pacific is poised to take advantage of a strengthening economy by leveraging our best in industry franchise to produce long-term growth and excellent returns. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. I guess you went from no follow-up for me this time. Okay, so I'll just stick to one. Good morning, everyone. Jennifer, I just wanted to focus on the 200 basis points of margin improvement this year. I think that implies 56.5 OR for this year, which would be...which would be impressive, it sort of implies you guys hitting kind of a mid '50s or better this year at some quarter maybe in the back half of the year. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that mix is obviously getting a little bit better, but if you can talk about what you think needs to be achieved to get to the high end of that 150 million 200 target. Jennifer Hamann : So thanks for the question. So yes, I mean starting off the year with a 60.1 and be able to get to in that range of 56.5 to 57 and as we said, we're hoping to get closer to the 200 basis points of improvement. That certainly says we have to improve over the balance of the year and make very strong improvement to hit those targets. And so in terms of what gives us confidence, it really is the ability to win in the marketplace. As we mentioned that we're expecting volumes to be around 6% or so up year-over-year as you might recall back in January our original guidance was 46%, so we're now seeing strengthening in the economy. Kenny and the team winning new business and so, those are all very positive signs. And then again, the efficiency piece, certainly we were impacted in the quarter with weather and fuel, they took their toll on the first quarter OR. But we still generated 150 basis points of core improvement. And so as we look to grow volumes and put some of those transitory issues behind us. We feel good about the rest of the year. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey Thanks, good morning guys. Lance just given everything going on, I wanted to ask an M&A question. So, you guys have been very focused on operating ratio and over time, I sense perhaps more of a focus on volume and overall earnings growth going forward. I wondered, does that change your view around M&A and if it's perhaps time to start thinking more about that, and then on the specific transactions on the table right now, do you have a view or a preference of CN, in case your Cpk is one a bigger threat to you, is perhaps one that's more likely to cause you to think about extending your own network reach. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thanks, Scott. I'll start with the last part of the question-and-end with the first part, regarding whether the CPU or the CN we're to acquire the KCS, our concern It really is the same. What we're focused on is with the STB says the next Class 1 merger must provide, and that is an enhancement to the competition and clear improvement for all customers, through that to be true in any transaction our current service product has to remain intact. So our concern is making sure that we have good operational and commercial access to all the customers that we serve currently in Mexico and in other parts, whether this near or on the CP railroad or the CN railroad as regards to that transaction, the first thing we're focused on is making sure that the STB sets up a level playing field for all Class 1 mergers and in that does not apply the waiver that they created potentially for the KCS back in 2000-2001. We think those new 2001 merger rules should apply to every Class 1 merger, so that the STB has a full opportunity to vet the game plan to enhance competition by the transaction. And then, if you think a little bit about what we're focused on, you're exactly right. We're focused on the three stools to drive enterprise value for Union Pacific, the three legs of the stool, excuse me, we're focused on making sure we get value-based pricing in the marketplace, we're focused on making sure that we're efficient and productive both in assets and an operating expense and we're focused on growth and I think growth is going to play a bigger role, it has to. And then as regards, whether or not that changes our stance on overall M&A activity, our big concern on any Class 1 merger is that in the STB's regulatory review, they are committed to enhancing competition and they are also committed to taking a look at the downstream impacts of weather creates incentives to remain in stability in the industry for further consolidation. In that context, we see a lot of opportunities for long-term value impact that's not in our best interest. We're going to be very, very active and engaged in this process with the STB and of potentially directly with the acquirers and we're going to first and foremost focused on making sure that we protect our interest and then help the STB enhance competition as they seek us. Scott Group : Okay. So it sounds like you've got some concerns around both transactions and you're not thinking about M&A in your near future. Lance Fritz : That's correct. Scott. At this point, we are not contemplating M&A, we've done plenty of work to understand what the costs and benefits could be and we'll just continue to be engaged and monitor the process. Scott Group : Okay, thank you for the thoughts Lance. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Yes, hey, thanks, good morning! Lance, wanted to pick up on some of your comments about some of the long-term growth potential. I guess in the context of the competitive environment and the improvements that UP has been making under its PSR progress over the course of the last couple of years, maybe give us a little bit of a sort of preview maybe how you think about some of the growth opportunities for the franchise, if you go out maybe just beyond this year, but obviously including this year, it seems like your macro is going to be a help to you but has service gotten to the point where maybe the competitive landscape in the Western United States is a bit more favorable for you or does that sort of factor into your outlook when you think about some of the multi-year growth potential of the company. Lance Fritz : Good question Chris and thank you for asking it. So when we think about growth, there is a number of ways that we're able to attack it, one is opening markets to us that hadn't been open before either through a more consistent reliable service product, which is true or a lower cost structure, which is also true. So we see clearly more opportunity happening. Another way to do it is to expand our reach and that can be done any number of ways, it can be done by a new intermodal terminal in Minneapolis, it can be done by a new transload, it can be done by taking property that already exists around the Dallas intermodal terminal and turning it into opportunity to cite new industry on it. All of that is underway and Kenny maybe I'll ask you to make some observations and give us a few examples of the kinds of growth opportunities you're achieving right now. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So, I think so. First of all, Chris, you know, it really does start with the service product. Eric and his team have done a really fabulous job of improving the service performance and it shows up in things like car velocity. So for example, as you look at our intermodal network is that velocity becomes more reliable and more consistent, but we're able to compete right up there with truck on that domestic network. The same is true with parcel. And then as you look at the carload business, the lower cost structure has really opened up market for us, we're able to compete and have been able to win in lower value commodities in areas like bulk, we're able to access customers that may not have want to take large positions on either fertilizers, or some commodities like grain that's been encouraging to us, on the auto side we've been really excited about new lines that we've won that we, that weren't there in the past, and then finally, Lance, as you talk about product sales that we talked about the product offering in Pocatello, where we're going to be able to provide a match back opportunities for containers getting back to the way. Lance Fritz : Yes, and Kenny, there's something else that Chris, that we haven't mentioned yet, two big drivers of near-term wins. One is our technology base our technology platform. You all know we rewrote our ERP over the course of the last number of years and it's a micro services architecture. What that means is APIs are really easy for us to do. We've already got something approaching, 4 dozen active APIs with our customer base. Those are helping us win business with electric vehicle manufacturers for instance that really care about the data streams technology platform is winning and then our ESG story is winning. There is a number of customers that are looking to us to help them reduce their carbon footprint and as you know that's becoming a much, much more important part of the conversation with a number of our customers. So there's a lot of moving parts there Chris and from our perspective, there is a lot of opportunity. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Okay, great. That this great color. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks everyone. Lance, I can give you one to one question, first is on the guide. I mean obviously you guys had a bit of a tough circumstance here with the weather that's completely understandable in 1Q, but given the much stronger second half macro outlook than 3 months ago, did you consider going to raising the guidance at all and also not to steal your thunder from next week, but can you give us a sense of what we can expect at the Analyst Day in terms of broad topics that you may address? Lance Fritz : Yes great, thank you. Ravi, so we do evaluate our guidance periodically. Of course, every quarter is an opportunity and we've delivered what we think is a good prudent middle of the fairway, a set of expectations as we look forward, we're already kind of moving ourselves up in the range, which is meaningful, 200 basis points of improvement is not jump change year-over-year, particularly when you're at the performance level that we were at last year at 58.5 that would mark us being a very, very strong industrial performer. So there is no more news on the second half guidance. I would also just remind you that there is some kind of very high optimism on what the second quarter is going to look like, just because the comps are so easy, but then when you get the 3rd and 4th quarter, we're starting to lap now the real acceleration in domestic intermodal, particularly the parcel world and we're also then starting to lap some of the real strength in grain. So it has yet to be seen exactly how that plays out. But even in that context, our guidance stands. And then in terms of what to expect for our Investor Day next week. So what you're going to hear is you're going to hear us lay out just what we talked about there, we're going to...we're going to lay out how we serve our customers and how that continues to improve and what to expect from us there in real granular firms. So you can, you can get a good sense of the work streams and what to expect, you're going to, you're going to hear us lay out how we expect to grow, will name customers, we'll talk about very specific opportunity and work streams that you can hold us to account for. We'll talk about what winning looks like in that context and kind of reaffirm of course guidance this year. And then we're going to talk about a couple of markers we're going to lay down for the next 3 years. And then we're going to start with a nice overall context of how doing that together with all of our stakeholders really comes to reality. So we'll talk about our ESG story. We'll talk about what's going on with our employees, the communities that we serve. Because I think that's a critically important part of how we run this railroad. We have a social license to operate and all 7300 communities that we serve and they need to hear us talk about how much we value them and our relationship with them and how we keep it healthy. So you're going to hear all of that you're going to see it in 2 hours and you're going to see the leadership team of Union Pacific tell that story collectively. Ravi Shanker : Excellent, looking forward to that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the topic of service and growth, and specifically the trip plan compliance, not to say that both the manifest and Intermodal took a step back from weather, but Eric, I think you mentioned earlier, you know, sort of meeting to get the manifest trip plan compliance back to the low to mid '70s. So I mean, that's really where you need to be longer term to start to chip away at the opportunity to convert some of the merchandize volume from the highway or do you need to be somewhere in the '80s or '90s range to really be competitive with truck and then if you could just sort of help us through, when you think you could get there if that could start to accrue in 2021 and more about '22 and beyond story? Lance Fritz : I appreciate your question, Allison. So my guidance today is really focused on the short-term as we think about going into the second quarter that we're in right now and what the team focused on responding to and recovering trip plan compliance both on the intermodal and the manifest and the auto side. To your point into the discussion we've had so far this morning, growth is going to take a lot of different forms. I remain completely open to the idea that as we continue to progress forward both in 2021 and beyond. We're going to see opportunities to be able to grow that service product very intentionally broadly, but then also some growth opportunities, will demand certain operations that we will continue to work with Kenny on as he finds those opportunities and we partner together to bring them on the railroad. So we have a complete dedication to growing TPC broadly, but then also remain very close with Kenny to ensure that we're providing the service in certain opportunities to continue to grow that business. Kenny Rocker : Eric, let me jump in and part of your question Allison was kind of what should the thresholds be and our experience at least right now. And I would say into the near-term tells us trip plan compliance on the manifest side about 75-ish plus or minus better more is better, but there is a threshold at which more costs more than it's valued. And then on the intermodal side, we do think high '80s '90s is kind of where that needs to be parked to be reliable and truck-competitive. Allison Landry : Okay, just to clarify the manifest the mid-70 like [indiscernible] at what point do you reach the threshold? We just mentioned that the cost is at low '80s or should we think about the mid-70s mark? Lance Fritz : Look Allison, it's not a hard and fast rule. If you look backwards when volume goes away like it did in the second quarter you can run a railroad really smoothly and efficiently and get those numbers jacked up pretty good. I would just say somewhere in the mid '70s is great for manifest if it starts creeping up into the mid '80s in mid-90s, it's probably more service than is valued and not the same in intermodal, intermodal there's an appetite for '90s and they'll pay for it. Kenny Rocker : Yes, let me jump in real quick, what I just want to say what is critical here is the reliability part of it that could predictably can get to that 75 and we can take that to the customer, we can still talk to them about going after truck lanes that they know predictably that it's going to be at 75 or 77 or 73 or whatever that number is. Allison Landry : Okay, I understand. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Eric. If you could just give us an update on the metrics through April here on the key performance, KPIs. I think that'll be helpful to hear how things are moving on some of the more detailed ones that you track. And then just from a bigger picture perspective workforce productivity is still pretty strong despite the challenges offer all-time record last quarter and how do you view that in the context of some of the growth that you're mentioning can that still improve independent of the growth and what the mix might look like? And then if I can squeeze one in for Lance, can you just give us an update on, we're talking about labor on the train crew size negotiations. I realize it's still early, but we're seeing more about putting potentially a conductor on the ground in the I guess the next few years. If and when that gets negotiated. So if you can just bring us up to speed on...on what that means and how that's progressing. That would be helpful as well. Thank you. Eric Gehringer : We just started. Sounds good. So if we look at Slide 4 as our baseline, so you see on the left-hand side we can just start with freight car velocity showing 209 last 7 day, 218; freight car terminal dwell. So in 23.5 for the quarter last 7 days, 22.6. So very strong indications that we are out of that weather event, we're recovering the system, have recovered much of the system and can get back on the pace than we were before. So strong confidence that we can do that. Brian Ossenbeck : I also asked about the labor prudent. Eric Gehringer : Yes, so on the labor productivity side, we think about that, 2 ways. Is there more opportunities to continue to grow that number? Absolutely there is. When we think about how do you make sure you're doing that, you're really focused on, are you getting the retention rate that you expect out of the people that are currently furloughed, we're sitting at 75% to 85% on that. So we're still very effective had been able to retain when we need to be able to bring our people for growth and at the same time, our total furloughed count on the TE&Y side of 1400. So there is a strong pool there to draw upon, so no concerns at this time. Lance Fritz : And then I'll build off that labor productivity commentary to answer your labor negotiation question Brian, which is we are right in the middle of national round. It's been underway for over a year. The railroads are pursuing crew size changes in the capital locomotive, if successful, that would put one of the individuals on the ground servicing, more than one train. We think that's got a lot of positives to it, first and foremost is a, is a lifestyle improvement for half of the capital locomotive in that circumstance, one of the most difficult parts of being train and engine men on the railroad is that their work schedules are unpredictable, they match the flow of trains, which are 24/7, 365. If we can put somebody on the ground, we can create that work into shift work and scheduled shift work which is a real benefit. There are other benefits of course it's a real productivity move, but that's far from certain that we'll be able to get that in this round we're pursuing it of course it's got to be negotiated. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you, Eric. And I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Just a follow-up on a couple of questions. In the first quarter you said last year or first part our 46% carload target for the year. Moving to the top end of that, but if can you mention IP up 200 basis points since you set that target. Do you still see yourself as being conservative by staying in that target, or are there any losses we need to consider in share and then thoughts to meet that? Just to follow on the last question, your employee changes maybe Jan you can throw. I mean, down 12%. What your thoughts are on employees by year-end? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Let me take the conservative or not conservative question if I could, the short answer is no, I mean 46% was our best thinking before 6%, our best thinking now we'll keep tuned up on it. We've talked about the potential headwinds late in the year. But yes, it's our best thinking. Jennifer Hamann : And I would just add to that and Allison wants a large commentary. We're also starting in a little bit worse off than we anticipated when we laid out our guidance for you. We had a tougher first quarter than how things actually played out with what happened with weather. So, but to your headcount question, Ken in terms of how we see that playing out where it call it just shy of 30,000 employees. Today, we think that we should be able to even at the high end of that range, kind of keep steady state relative to those, you may see some ups and downs a little bit. We may actually have to do a little bit of hiring in some small locations if we don't have adequate crew base there. You heard Eric refer to the 1400 furloughs, but we plan on being very efficient with the crew base. And so we think even up to that high-end of the range that we gave, the 6%. We should be able to keep that pretty flat with some little seasonal fluctuation. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate it. Thanks. Lance Fritz : Thanks. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. So I guess, I want to follow-up on Ken's question there, Lance or Eric or maybe you can, Jennifer with where trip plan compliance is where you want to get it, it just feels like a repetitive scene when rail volumes come back historically, we see, not just Union Pacific but industry service metrics really lag. So I guess what can be different this time that you think you can do of such of our resource base because I think historically, you know the answer was always throw more light going to more locomotives assets employees that is no. Lance Fritz : Yes, that's a great question, a very fair question Brandon. What's different for us is a demonstrated track record now, in our world of PSR where when volumes return, we don't crater a case in point. Perfect. Great. Case in point is last year, last year volumes dropped as dramatically as we've ever seen in our recorded history from, call it late February, early March into April and then subsequently recovered as fast as we've ever seen. And if I recall in the recovery period from Q2 to Q3 to Q4. We continued to improve our metrics on service, that's a proof statement right now when you go from 120,000 seven days to a 160,000 seven day at the end of the year. Now clearly, you're loading resources into a pretty empty network at that point, but you're still having to do the work of loading resources into the network. I think the same is true right now. I'm going to make up a number. If we go from today's volume to a 180,000 seven day, we've got on a network, a physical franchise that can handle that pretty readily and the job would be to efficiently layer in the train starts, that would be necessary to crews, the locomotive and we've demonstrated, we know how to do that and should be able to do that. Eric, take the color. Eric Gehringer : And one of the greatest tool to do that is all of our continued efforts on train length as, as we reported this morning, we're up 10%, 850 feet. But when you're thinking about the service product and being able to deliver that, one of the best tool you have is a very fluid network as we think about 2.5 years ago, we would have had 800-ish trains running around of any given day. Now, we're at 600 and 605 a day, that's 25% less potential variability events, which is the primary driver for any degradation and trip plan compliance, so continuing to leverage train link on top of how we operate in our terminals both key opportunities to consistently drive that number up to that mid 80 number. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, you noted the tight truck capacity in the favorable outlook for taking share off the highway, beyond the weather, the West Coast congestion issues still seem to be in the headlines and the rails seem to be getting thrown at the bus, a little bit as part of the problem, not the solution, can you speak to the progression of clearing some of the backlog, especially as it relates to the West Coast ports? And then also, what's your capacity to actually take advantage then of this favorable competitive dynamic that you have from a cost perspective? The headlines you are reading, I have got a thought in, Eric as you pitched in back me to talk about on opportunities, but, look, when you look at the port congestion that's going on there, there's a lot going on there. There's a lot of supply chain, the court conversations with a lot of ocean carrier and a port here recently, so let me just break down here a few things. One, we know about the increased demand that's been pretty flattened, but one other thing that you look at, another variable that you look at is the warehousing capacity. So in a lot of cases, the warehouses out there aren't just full, they are unable to physically take the container, so we have seen those containers still left out there on the floor. There are some challenges on the trade side, certainly some labor issues at the terminal, and then, if you look at the trucking capacity to even go long-haul, there are tightness there. So, what we're focused on here is what we can control. And Eric, if you wanted to talk about what we're doing from an operational standpoint. Eric Gehringer : Sure. And Jon, I appreciate the question because the Union Pacific is a critical component of that entire supply chain Kenny was mentioning. So when we look at being able to ensure that we have the resources up against that we're always looking at how, what's the total footage of trains that we're able to depart from the LA Basin specifically out of ICTF and so if we go back in time from July to October last year, we had 60,000 feet of capacity. Now as we sell that volume continue to increase. We were intentional and ahead of time increase that to 68,000 in the middle of November and then actually again in April 1 of this year, we took that to 80,000 now that's on top of and driving a 25% increase in our train starts out of the LA Basin also to support that growth. So you see, I hope you see Union Pacific as the component in that process, that's doing everything they can to bring on that volume and efficiently, get it out of the LA Basin and into the Inland Empire, inland terminals, which helps the overall fluidity with the entire supply chain. Kenny Rocker : So, just close out here, Jon. We feel good about the incremental wins that we're seeing on the domestic side. It is a tight market as we're going through this season. We feel encouraged by some of the past wins on the international intermodal side though, as we move throughout the year, we're fully going very optimistic about the marketplace. Jon Chappell : Okay. Thank you, Kenny. Thanks, Eric. Operator : There your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to go back a little bit to the some of the consolidation question Lance said. I think your comments this morning and, in the past, have been kind of cautious about rail consolidation, are you essentially against consolidation. Would you say. We just don't think it should happen, or is that kind of overstating it and then in terms of gateway. I mean, obviously, you do a large amount of business at the Laredo gateway, how do you protect yourself. Yes. CP CN get care few and there is some essentially bridge traffic that you have from Laredo to Chicago that would potentially be at risk? So how do you think about what you need to do to protect yourself at that gateway? Lance Fritz : And Tom, good morning and thanks for the questions. We've been very clear on consolidation. You mentioned that we think that the process the STB is committed to undertake in terms of reviewing any Class 1 merger to ensure it both enhances competition has better outcomes for all customers and that they contemplate the downstream impacts when you boil that all together and note that the STB has full authority to put in whatever remedies and regulations are required to achieve that we've always thought there is lots of opportunity in that to destroy long-term value for the industry. That's our big concern. If we are constantly evaluating long term enterprise value creation, part of that is weather not mergers make sense for us and that's always been a primary sticking point. We'll have to navigate this current process to see how it comes out. And of course will be an active participant in it. Related to the second part of your question, which is how do we protect or how do we ensure that the competitive option that the UP represent, it doesn't get disadvantaged by either the CPU or the CN, if they were to own KCS and you've got it exactly right. The Laredo gateway is the primary gateway for the KCS KCSM and we'd have to do 2 things. We have to make sure that operationally, we're treated fairly and equitably at the gateway and then we'd have to make sure commercially that we're treated fairly and equitably to all the points that we currently have an opportunity to serve with our franchise in the United States in conjunction with the KCSM, our franchise is damn good, the best in the industry. And that's why we represent about 2/3 of all rail cross border traffic to and from Mexico would be a crying shame and it would be against what the STB has committed they would do in evaluating the merger if that excellence is replaced by something that's inferior and it's because we're disadvantaged. So we'll be crystal clear about that in front of the STB and in the process. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. But you think there are we to protect the franchise at Laredo? Lance Fritz : Yes, 100%. There are, and they would be it positions concessions remedies that would flow through FTD. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you, Lance. Thanks for the perspective. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. Just wanted to ask a slightly different question regarding the capacity challenges on the West Coast. I was just hoping you could comment on what you've done to protect service for customers in the mutual commitment program and what do you expect to see more interest in that program going forward. Just given the capacity challenges across all modes. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thanks, Cherilyn. I mean clearly, we announced that and have taken the action to protect those customers that are in the program, and we are doing that with a lot quicker responsiveness as we see the market changes as we see the supply chain tightened. We will take those actions and European enough to, that we're in constant communication with our customers and help and talk into them about their supply chain as it relates to the Street time as it relates to dwell and what they're doing with their BCOs and individual customer, so were going beyond just having that surcharge out there and talking with our customers about what they can do to make sure that they can efficiently utilize of assets. Cherilyn Radbourne : And do you expect to see more interest in that program going forward? Lance Fritz : We have not seen any of that waiver and we would expect the entrants to be there and be strong. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That's all from me. Operator : Gentleman, the next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So just following on that question with regards to congestion and if we do see a very significant increase in economic activity, potentially above and beyond what's currently expected, how much of your ability to protect services within is outside of your control? In other words, what can you do here to speak to your supply chain partners to make sure that, that everything remains fluid and how much of a risk is that? And just as a follow-on question there on yields. I think you mentioned that yields were going to be negative for the year and I'm just curious with everything going on with that demand and the potential pricing opportunities. Are you still expecting yields to be negative for this year? Lance Fritz : Let me start on both. And then, I'll turn it over to first probably Kenny and Eric to comment on specifics about congestion and how do we avoid it. I don't think we've said anything about negative yields in the year, Jennifer. Jennifer Hamann : Now we said the business mix is expected to be negative. Lance Fritz : Right. Jennifer Hamann : But not so overall yield. So when you think about yields. Obviously, there's numerous components there is the mix impact. There's, which we do expect is going to be pressured probably going to look a little bit better here in the second quarter and 3rd quarter of pressure in the 4th quarter with some of the grain come. But in terms of pricing. So, very good about pricing and then fuel surcharges. This is the last quarter where we've got a pretty negative comparison year-over-year relative to fuel prices and surcharges. And so that should look better over the balance of the year as well. Lance Fritz : Yes, I'm sorry. Walter said yields, I went to how we define, yes without predominantly price at the price, so Walter, talking to a little bit about congestion and if economic activity surprises us and is even stronger and continues to strengthen, what are we going to do about avoiding congestion? And the short answer is making sure that we've got the right resources against it staying ahead of it through the viewpoint of Kenny and his team in terms of translating economic activity in the carloads for us which we do routinely and periodically to try to stay front. And I also need to make sure we talk, Kenny and Erin both talked about us having the full supply chain visibility and working towards that specifically with the West Coast ports, but that's an active engagement whether it's in the LA Basin or up in the PNW on our part to make sure that we and the entire supply chain have transparency and visibility into to make sure that we and the entire supply chain has the transparency and visibility into what's happening, what the metrics are and KPIs need to be for us to stay fluid and support an excellent service product. And from my perspective, that's not just about satisfying current demand, that's about making sure that the West Coast ports are competitive in a very, very competitive world where stuff can hit Prince Rupert or the Gulf Coast or the East Coast, Eric. Eric Gehringer : Yes, I'll take on the resources on hand over to the visibility. So when you think about what are the resource base rate, you're talking about 3 things, you're talking about locomotives. So obviously we have reported that we have 3000 plus locomotives in storage, but we also more importantly to respond to that growth as we have been at the ready locomotives that are actually pre-placed out in geographical areas like the LA Basin. So we can be very agile in responding to that, from a car perspective, we know how many constraints on that. Now as Kenny mentioned earlier, you're trying to drive intermodal velocity, higher and higher, which just allows you to turn the cars faster and provide you even more at the ready for cars as well and then crew base wise still use the same process we use every single month to evaluate crude demand, see as Jennifer mentioned, there may be sporadic hiring some of that may be in the LA Basin, but no immediate concerns on crews. And then, finally, it's the agility for decision making when I talked about increasing the train count on the LA Basin by 25% that was a decision we started on Monday, and by Wednesday. We're already moving the resources there to answer that call. So I feel very comfortable on the operating side. Kenny Rocker : Yes, I'd just add to that. We stay very coordinated with the customer on what they plan to do on what their forecasts are. And then we in turn taken that it didn't now with Eric and so he talked about the adjustments that we've made. We've got visibility just talking to our customers, from that perspective, obviously here this year, we made some changes to our charges to incentivize our customers to get the equipment moving regardless whether it's our equipment or their equipment. We are sitting down with our customers to talk about efficiency in turn times and well, I think they can do to get the network moving so boy. We feel really good about the visibility there. And in the coordination there and decisiveness there to keep the network fluid. Walter Spracklin : Okay, I appreciate. Then just to clarify, I was referring to there where it was negative 2.5% in the first quarter, I think Jennifer you you'd indicated that it would. The business mix would keep that kind of negative for the full year and that was what I was asking about but it sounds like you add to. That's great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Just following up on the revenue per carload yield and I'll be instead, to be sufficient to get move that into the positive territory as soon as the second quarter or is it more second half. And then just, then I think you've mentioned biofuel now for at least a couple of quarters. I'm just curious of that opportunity now and perhaps scope and size of that opportunity down the road. Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Jordan. This is Jennifer, certainly the second quarter should look better last year's second quarter was obviously with the pandemic greatly impacted especially with the auto production, which was virtually stopped. Now we do still have some production headwinds. This year, that's a little bit of a headwind, but we're expecting it to look better rather it will turn positive in the second quarter. I think that is really going to be dependent on the mix, but we feel good about the direction that things are going, particularly in the back half. Kenny Rocker : Yes, so biofuels, we've been very encouraged with where we are today with that and we are even more encouraged with where we see by the end of the year and long term, we do see that renewable diesel have a had lags. We've been working with customers to land by on our network and we feel really good about that. We've talked to a growing number of customers that are interested and have committed capital dollars to investment, but we know it's real. So that's why you're seeing that optimism there from us on the biofuels, at that point. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. Lance, following up on the topic of growth in some of the tailwinds that you mentioned. Do you think volume growth above GDP is something that's achievable longer term for the business and if the answer to that is yes, is this something that can happen without negatively impacting mix because I'm guessing a lot of the truckload conversion opportunity is coming in intermodal; it's a lower ARPU. Lance Fritz : Yes, it's a great question, Justin. So the short answer is, we believe we can grow faster than our served markets, GDP might not be the best measure right because there is a boatload of services embedded in GDP but maybe instead, you'd have to look at the elements of industrial production. So the one caveat I'd give you is that's going to be true. We expect that to be true. We'll be able to drive that with the exception of handful of commodities, coal being one of them, perhaps petroleum being another one and maybe frac sand being another, but you take those off the table and our expectation, if we grow at a better rate than our served markets Jennifer Hamann : And just say to the next question. We're going to grow profitably. I mean we expect to be able to, we recognize that that's a dynamic that we have in our business today, but we don't see that has been the hindrance has been able to improve our profitability through ongoing efficiency through price into the service that we provided in the marketplace. So that's all kind of baked into how we're looking at the future, and obviously we'll talk more about that on. Therefore Justin Long : Great. Appreciate the time. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Good morning to Lance. One of the things that stands out in these two competing bids for case you is this opportunity to convert Highway Traffic either from the Laredo gateway or the Texas area perhaps down even as far down in the Mexico up into the Midwest, now as you look at that intermodal opportunity in that truck conversion opportunity. Would you agree that that is a huge potential market? and if so, what are you guys doing to actually capitalize on that short of a merger? and what can you do to kind of catalyze some of that growth, because it seems like there's a lot of truck-competitive traffic in that corridor and that's carriers are saying is not being converted today because there is a merger, like how do you think about getting out of that opportunity? Lance Fritz : Thank you, David. So let's start with the potential there is a lot of truck traffic that can be converted to rail and we're constantly working with both the FXE in the KCSM to try to get that done. We have been successful in actually growing our overall intermodal product that we call it the domestic intermodal product. Even though it's to and from Mexico and we expect to continue to do that. Now let's pick and shovel work, right, because we've got to get the FXE or the KCSM interested in a move that might be relative shortfall for them in comparison to what they might be able to do just staying within Mexico, if that's the case, there is always an opportunity to use truck in Mexico as the origination or destination and transload at the border. It's a little more complex, but we do that today and we can continue to do some of that. So yes, the market's big it's pick and shovel work to convert and there has been plenty of advertising about the potential to convert and what it means in synergies, we have not seen the game plan that would be required to be filed with the SCB and once we see that game plan, all of us then can start evaluating how real is it and is it going to be done at our expense, in which case, there's got to be a remedy that maintains our competitive posture. David Vernon : And then maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, if you look at the routing on your railroad of the reserve, why not Laredo up into the Midwest. That's always been the. I think the lease routing out there. I was just wondering for the rail traffic that's coming over that corridor. I'd imagine customers have a lot of say on the routing. So just because there is another way to kind of move it up a different route, it's out of route. I mean what role, the customers play and sort of determining the routing and some of that carload traffic that would help us assess kind of the diversion risk there? Lance Fritz : A potential acquisition is the combined carriers might have the opportunity to go to an inferior routing through a commercial construct and it's, and it's not best for the customer, it's not best for the market. David Vernon : Thanks, officer [ph]. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks, operator. And then, Lance and team, thank you for taking this Kenny maybe one for you on the automotive side, I mean obviously that's a question mark. You guys have up there going forward. Clearly, that's going to depend on the ability to get the ships and manufacturing back up, but once that is back up and running. What should that backlog look like for you guys. And what should we expect on the volume side, in the second half of the year and maybe into the first half of 2022. Kenny Rocker : You're talking about international intermodal not automotive. Jason Seidl : Automotive, yes. Kenny Rocker : If the demand is there. We expect that demand Jason, to be strong for the rest of the year. So going into peak season. So the overall demand will be there. You've heard us talk about some of the wins in the international intermodal side and we've also her Eric talk about what we're doing to service the customers out there. So we are encouraged with the demand structure that there with our ability to compete and as the supply chain moves out a little bit. And when I say that I mean the well that warehouse and the Street time that should also open up the velocity for us to move more volume. Jason Seidl : So you're - then the premium service. Then in the back half of the year and then in the 2022, but it's just a question mark. I just ask quickly, it's going to come back. Kenny Rocker : I am. That's a good way to not feel confident about the demand on the international intermodal side. Justin Long : Okay. I appreciate the time, as always. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time, I will now turn the floor to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. Just a reminder, we have an upcoming Virtual Investor Day on May 4 at 2 :00 PM Eastern Time. We're all looking forward to discussing our strategy and vision for Union Pacific and we hope you're going to be able to attend with us. I wish you all good health and take care. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The team at Union Pacific continued to demonstrate their capability, as we moved increasing volumes while dealing with challenging capacity constraints in some of our important supply chains. The result was the team delivered all-time record financial results. Our employees are making good on our strategy to serve, grow and win together. Regarding our second quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2021 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.72 per share. This compares to $1.1 billion, or $1.67 per share in the second quarter of 2020. While comparisons to the second quarter of last year are skewed by the COVID impact, a comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the impressive results we achieved during the quarter. Our quarterly operating ratio of 55.1% is an all-time record. In addition, we set quarterly records for operating income, net income and earnings per share. These records highlight how the team is running the Union Pacific franchise to deliver results, as we pulled all three profitability levers simultaneously, volume price and productivity. The second quarter also marked an important milestone in our quest to reduce our carbon footprint, as we achieved a second quarter best fuel consumption rate. Locomotive fuel efficiency is the critical element to achieving our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And we're helping our customers achieve their ESG goals, too, as they eliminated 5.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the quarter by using rail versus truck. While our financial results were impressive in the second quarter, our customers felt the impact of intermodal supply chain disruptions and costly rail equipment incidents. Within the intermodal space, we've taken numerous actions to mitigate the customer impact, and are actively working with all parties in the supply chain. Even so, it's likely these issues will persist through the end of the year, as the capacity to move boxes from our ramp to the final destination falls short of demand. Relative to rail equipment incidents, while the number and rate improved their impact on the network was notable. We're redoubling our efforts to utilize best-in-class technology, training, and root cause analysis to keep our crews, our customers and our communities safe. To that end, we'll start with Eric and an update on our operations. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Lance, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire operating department for their support, our customers through the many transitory challenges we\u2019ve faced during the first-half of this year. While we don't see these events impacting us long-term, there's real work to be done to get past them. Moving to Slide 4. Taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter. It's important to note that year-over-year comparisons are a little skewed. 2020 included a couple historically low volume months at the start of the pandemic. So as Lance said, we've provided a 2019 comparison to give a little more context to more normal, seasonal volumes. Freight car velocity improved from 2019 due to the execution of PSR principles that reduced freight car terminal dwell and improved train speeds. However, we still have work to do to return to running a more fluid network, with the goal to return this metric back to the 220 miles per day range to 230 miles per day range we achieved earlier this year. As you can see, our service reliability as measured by trip plan compliance has improved over the time in both service categories. However, current quarterly metrics do not meet our expectations or that of our customers. Disruptions in the international supply chains, especially in the intermodal space, have impacted our network significantly. At the expense of our own service metrics, we chose to help reduce port congestion by moving more assets into dock operations. But that West Coast port congestion has now moved East, and is affecting some of our inland terminals, most notably in Chicago. We are working proactively with our commercial team and ocean carrier customers to address the congestion, while continuing to sustain shipment volumes, to and from the ports. To help alleviate the congestion and maintain fluidity, we also temporarily reopened Global III in Chicago for use as an inland storage. We are also working with our customers to develop additional storage and transportation options. We will continue to work with all members of the supply chain, our ocean carrier customers, beneficial cargo owners, port operators, chassis providers, and dray carriers to mean the fluidity of international freight flows. During the first-half, our network has been impacted by weather and costly rail equipment incidents as well. We have made good progress on reducing the frequency of rail incidents. However, the location of a couple of the incidents occurring on our East West main corridor and our sunset route had a notable effect on both intermodal and manifest auto trip plan compliance measures. Ultimately, we recognize the importance of improving these metrics to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress in our efficiency measures, as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. Improvement in locomotive productivity was the result of running an efficient transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives. Workforce productivity was an all-time quarterly record, driven by an increase in daily car miles of more than 20%, while workforce levels remained flat. These improvements were also driven by our continued focus on growing train linked, which has grown by 9% since the second quarter 2020 to just over 9,400 feet. Increasing and more consistent volumes provide the team with more optionality to adjust transportation plans. We will continue to focus on train length to run a more efficient and reliable railroad for our customers. Turning to Slide 6. One driver of the continued increase in train length is our siding extension program. Through the first-half of the year, we've completed seven sidings and began construction or the bidding process on more than 20 additional sidings. Through growing train size, other productivity initiatives and technology, our fuel consumption rate was a second quarter record, improving 3% compared to last year. The operating department understands the important role we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals. Wrapping up on Slide 7. The entire team is focused on performing our work safer every day. Year-to-date, our safety results have been mixed. Real equipment incidents have decreased, but personal injuries increased. To address personal injuries, we are maturing our peer-to-peer safety programs, which is a continuation and next level of our Courage-to-Care program. Recently, our network has been impacted by wildfires in Northern California. Our Dry Canyon Bridge north of Redding, California sustained significant structural damage. The team is working around the clock to repair the bridge. Current projections have a reopening in late August. We are actively rerouting traffic in that area, which requires additional crew and locomotive resources, as well as adding transit time to those customer shipments. Ultimately, I have the utmost confidence that we will guide our network through these transitory challenges, and return our service product to the level our customers expect and deserve. The team did an excellent job during the quarter and how efficiently we added volume to our network. PSR remains our guiding principle and the improvements you've seen, and our productivity and operating efficiency speaks to that commitment. Our ability to be far more volume variable with our cost structure is a testament to our employees who execute the plan every day. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Our second quarter volume was up 22% from a year ago, as all of our major markets improved from the economic shutdown that we saw from the onset of the pandemic. Freight revenue was up 29%, due to the volume increase coupled with a higher fuel surcharge and core pricing gains. We clearly have easy comp this quarter versus last year. In order to provide a little more color into the current business, I will also share our sequential comparison to the first quarter, as I walk through each of the business groups. So, let's get started with our bulk commodity. Revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to last year, driven by a 13% increase in volume, and a 5% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Coal and renewable carloads grew 6% year-over-year and 14% from the first quarter, due to higher natural gas prices supporting domestic coal demand, Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter, as well as increased coal exports. Grain and grain products were up 22% year-over-year due to the strength in both domestic and export grain. Ethanol shipments also continue to improve as production recovers from COVID-related shutdown. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year and 23% from the first quarter, due to strong agricultural demand and seasonality of fertilizer applications. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 17% year-over-year and 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by higher consumer demand, as the economy recovers from COVID, along with increased growth from truck penetration. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue improved 24% for the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in volume, coupled with an 8% increase in average revenue per car from a positive mix of traffic, core pricing gains and a higher fuel surcharge. Energy and specialized shipments were up 20% year-over-year, but we're down 1% compared to the first quarter, as strength in specialized shipments were offset by fewer crude oil shipments, and seasonal LPG demand. Forest products continues to be a bright spot, as second quarter volumes grew 28% year-over-year and 7% over the first quarter. Lumber drove this increase from strong housing start, repairing remodels, along with further penetration from product moving over the road. Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 11% for both year-over-year and the first quarter comparison. The sequential growth was driven by the recovery of the Gulf Coast production rates from the February storm and improved demand. Metals and minerals volumes was up 12% year-over-year and 25% from the first quarter, driven by increased rock shipments and stronger steel demand, as the industrial sectors recover. Turning now to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 50% on a 31% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased by 14% from higher fuel surcharge revenue, positive mix of traffic and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 119% year-over-year, but down 4% compared to the first quarter, driven by shortages for semiconductor-related parts. Intermodal volume increased by 21% year-over-year, and 10% from the first quarter. Domestic intermodal improved from continuous strength in retail sales and recent business wins, parcel in particular, benefited from the ongoing strength in e-commerce. International intermodal saw continued strength in containerize import, despite congestion in the overall global supply chain. Now, looking ahead to the back-half of 2021. Starting out with our bulk commodities, we expect coal to remain stable for the remainder of the year, based on the current natural gas futures as well as export demand. Our food and refrigerated shipments should continue to be strong, as the nation recovers from COVID coupled with truck penetration wins. We're also optimistic with our grain products business, as ethanol shipments will improve from increased consumer demand, and our focus in growing the renewable diesel market. Lastly, while we see positive signs for the upcoming grain harvest and strengthen export demand, we expect tight supply in the third quarter, as well as top year-over-year comparisons in the back-half of the year. As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable. However, there is still uncertainty with crew plans supporting crew by warehouse shipments. We continue to be encouraged by the strength and the industrial production forecast for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many of our markets. In addition, forest product volume will remain strong for us in the second-half of the year. And lastly for premium, automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to almost 17 million in 2021. However, we are keeping a watchful eye on the supply chain issues for parts related to the semiconductor chip. Now switching to intermodal, on the international side we expect demand to remain strong through the rest of the year. The entire supply chain continues to be constrained by most notably to haul away our containers from our inland ramp. But I've been pleased with the collaboration between our commercial and operating teams, as we work together to create solutions for our international customers to improve service and network fluidity. With regard to domestic intermodal, limited truck capacity will encourage conversion from over the road to rail, tampered by constraint on chassis supply. Retail inventories remained historically low, and restocking of inventory along with continued strength in the sales should drive intermodal volumes higher for the remainder of this year. Overall, I'm encouraged by the improving economic outlook, but more importantly, by our commercial teams\u2019 intensity and ability to win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific recorded record second quarter financials with earnings per share of $2.72 and an operating ratio of 55.1%. Rise in fuel prices throughout the quarter and the two month lag on our fuel surcharge programs, negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 210 basis points, and earnings per share by $0.04. Below the line, our previously announced real estate gain and a lower effective tax rate associated with reduced corporate tax rates in three states added $0.13 to earnings per share. Partially offsetting that good news in 2021 is a real estate gain of $0.08 recorded in last year second quarter. Setting aside the impact of one-time items and fuel, UP\u2019s core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 800 basis points, and added $1.04 to earnings per share. These results are a clear demonstration of how we are positioned to efficiently leverage volume growth to the bottom-line. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing a comparison of this quarter's results to second quarter 2020, as well as 2019. This is to provide additional context to our results by comparing periods with more normal seasonal volume levels. For perspective, seven day car loadings in the second quarter of 2019 were almost 166,000, versus only 133,000 in 2020, and then rebounding this year to 163,000. So, not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. For second quarter 2021, the combination of operating revenue up 30% and operating expense only up 17%, illustrates our efficient handling of volume growth to produce record quarterly operating income of $2.5 billion. Net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share also were quarterly records. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially versus the first quarter. Freight revenue totaled $5.1 billion in the second quarter, up 29% compared to 2020, and up 10% compared to the first quarter. Looking first at the year-over-year analysis, volume was the largest driver up 22% against the pandemic impacted second quarter 2020 volumes. Fuel surcharges increased freight revenue by 425 basis points compared to last year, as our fuel surcharge programs adjusted to rise in fuel prices. And as we experienced a strong demand environment, our pricing actions continue to yield dollars in excess of inflation. On a year-over-year basis, those gains were further supplemented by a slightly positive business mix, driving in total 300 basis points of improvement. Looking at freight revenue sequentially, volume was again the largest driver of growth, up 875 basis points against weather impacted first quarter volumes. Sequentially, fuel surcharge increased freight revenue 275 basis points. Business mix was actually negative sequentially, more than offsetting positive pricing gains and creating a 100 basis point headwind. Now, let's move on to Slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses. With volumes up 22% in the quarter, our benchmark of success is growing expenses at a slower rate. And as you have seen through our results, we did an excellent job of being more than volume variable with our cost structure. Looking at the individual lines, compensation and benefits expenses up 13% versus 2020. Second quarter workforce levels were flat compared to last year, generating very strong workforce productivity, as Eric described. Specifically, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable up only 10%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 5%. Offsetting some of this productivity was an elevated cost per employee, up 13% as we experienced increased overtime, and more recently, higher recrew costs associated with some of our network outages. Other drivers of the increase were wage inflation, the negative comparison against last year's management actions in response to the pandemic, as well as higher year-over-year incentive compensation. Quarterly fuel expense increased over 100% driven by a 71% increase in fuel prices, and the 22% increase in volumes. Offsetting some of this expense was a 3% improvement in our fuel consumption rate, driven by our energy management initiative and a more fuel efficient business mix. Purchase services and materials expense increased 8%, primarily due to higher volume related subsidiary drayage costs, as well as other volume related expenses, such as transportation and lodging for our train crews. These increases were partially offset by around $35 million of favorable one-time items. Equipment and other rents actually decreased 5% or $11 million, driven by decreased rent expense on stored equipment and higher TTX equity income, partially offset by volume increases. The other expense line increased 21% or $49 million this quarter, driven by last year's $25 million insurance reimbursement, higher casualty expenses and higher state and local taxes. Lastly, as previously announced in an 8-K during the quarter, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be closer to 23% for the year. Looking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18, despite some of the operational challenges that Eric discussed, we continue to generate solid productivity. Second quarter productivity totaled $130 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $235 million. Productivity results continue to be led by train length improvements and locomotive productivity. As we stated at our Investor Day, a better long-term indicator of our efficiency is incremental margins. So looking at this quarter, we achieved a very strong incremental margins of 78%, demonstrating the positive impact PSR is having on our operating models. Turning to Slide 19, cash from operations in the first-half of 2021 decreased slightly to $4.2 billion from $4.4 billion in 2020, a 4% decline. This decrease was the result of deferred tax payments last year. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 96%, and free cash flow increased in the first-half up $142 million or 9%, highlighting our ongoing capital discipline. Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances, we've returned $5.4 billion to shareholders year-to-date, as we increased our industry-leading dividend by 10% in May, and repurchased 19 million shares totaling $4.1 billion. This includes the initial delivery of a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program established during the quarter, and funded by new debt issued in mid-May. We finished the second quarter with a comparable adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, on par with the first quarter. Wrapping up on Slide 20, we are optimistic about what's ahead in the back-half of 2021. From a volume standpoint, we are increasing our growth outlook for the full year to around 7%, which includes just over a one point headwind from ongoing energy market challenges. We also see tough comparisons in both intermodal and grain, as well as continued impacts from the semiconductor shortage. And as you heard Kenny mentioned, supply chain challenges in the intermodal space are likely to slow asset turns and impact loading. On the flip side, we see growing confidence in the industrial sector, and the team is successfully executing on our plan to grow and win with customers. Looking at operating ratio, we're dropping the low end of our initial range and now expect to achieve roughly 200 basis points of improvement, or an operating ratio closer to 56.5% for full year 2021. With that strengthening outlook, cash generation is growing as is our plan for share repurchases, which we would target at approximately $7 billion or $1 billion more than we had originally planned. Finally, I want to acknowledge that these record results would not be possible without our great workforce. Behind each of these numbers is a member of the UP team, who works safely and efficiently to attract new business and serve our customers. And with UP\u2019s new employee stock purchase plan, the entire team has more opportunity to benefit from the company's success. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As I mentioned at the start, we must improve our safety performance, it's foundational to everything we do at Union Pacific. The pace of our progress has to accelerate. As Eric stated, we're dedicated to improving our service products to the level our customers expect and demand. All of our long-term goals are predicated on a safe, reliable and consistent service product. As you heard from Kenny, we're winning with customers and growing our business. You're seeing our customer focus and obsession in action. We've got fantastic momentum and we're excited about the increasing opportunities that we are creating and uncovering. Given the workforce issues faced across various parts of the supply chain outside of UP, we will likely be working to overcome that congestion for the remainder of the year. But our second quarter achievements set the table for continued strong results in the second-half of the year. These results also provide a solid start toward the long-term targets we set for the next three years that we laid out at our Investor Day in early May. The future is very bright for Union Pacific. We're in a fantastic position to deliver value to all of our stakeholders, as we win together. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. Let's see, I wanted to ask you a bit about the network constraints. Obviously, you took an action at G-IV that was unusual, but I know there was good logic, obviously, for that. Is that something where you're confident that we'll be reopened in a week? And then I guess, from a broader perspective, maybe for Kenny, or Lance, is this - is it the broader rail network issues or service issues, the significant headwind to your ability to gain fear from truck and make that pitch a better service? Or is this just extreme unusual times, and you don't think it really hurts you on that share gain versus truck strategy? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Tom. I'll start. This is Lance, and then I'll turn it over to Kenny. So, in terms of network constraints, we view them largely as transitory. There's one issue, which we pointed out in the international intermodal supply chain, which is about demand and inbound containers, overwhelming the capacity for the ultimate customer to take the boxes off our ramps and get them into their warehouses and distribution centers. We think that's going to be around for a little while. The pause that we've taken at G-IV is all about allowing those end users, those shippers to ultimately be able to clean off that inventory, so that we can start with a more fluid operation. And overall, I think, Kenny that we've demonstrated in this environment, we can still convert truck with our current service product. But that's in no way saying the current service product is adequate or appropriate for truck conversion in the long run. Kenny Rocker : Yeah, Lance, you said it right. Let me just back up for a minute and just say that this started with some pretty strong demand that we saw coming from international trade. And I'll tell you, Eric, and I jumped right in with our customers and all the supply chain members as soon as we saw this. And what I mean by that is first, we went out, we added more short rails, we added more long rails, we added more chassis, we increased the train start, we sat down with our customers on a daily basis, flew out to the ports and had executive meetings there. We also held an executive forum with all of the international intermodal customers to work through solutions. That's where we came up with a solution of G-III. What people don't know is we also came up with off ramp type solutions. And finally, we inserted loop to help with the BCOs to try to offer up solutions for more drayage off of our ramps. So, we've been working hand in hand with not only our customers, but everyone in the supply chain. And so, the pause that you see should help us balance the network. Now, on a broader level, this is transitory. We don't see this being around forever. We expect as the velocity continues to improve, absolutely, we're going to win more truck share. We've demonstrated that we can do it thus far, so we feel very good about what we see in the future. Tom Wadewitz : Do you think that the haul is going to be done within a week or is that -- can you comment on that? Kenny Rocker : We're in the early stages right now. What I can say is that we're working on a daily basis to make sure that that demand matches the haul way. Tom Wadewitz : Yep. Okay. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, sticking with you, given all the service issues that seem to be grabbing the headlines, your pricing environment still seems to be incredibly robust, pretty much across all sectors. Can you speak to balancing some of these service issues and your conversations with the customers to still being able to push through price on a consistent basis going forward? And maybe even as it relates to coal, where you're super cautious back in April, and maybe a little bit more balanced in July. Is there a chance you're still even being conservative with the coal outlook for the back-half of the year, especially on the pricing front? Kenny Rocker : Thanks, Jon. You've got a lot of questions here, I'll try to answer them all. So first of all, the pricing environment, we're going to price to the market and there's tight dray capacity, there's tight truck capacity. You look at even the first part of this year, we felt good about the price that we were able to take. We've improved on that price acceleration as we moved now to the second-half of the year. I do think it's important for us to look at our intermodal business, and not call that or have a broad brush to say all of our challenges in international intermodal are playing out in other areas. So, we are able to get more price and volume there. And then the last question is about coal, and as we look for the rest of the year, for sure, as we look at where the futures are, we think that the run rate that we see today will be consistent for the rest of the year. Jon Chappell : Got it. Thanks for your insight, Kenny. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one about mix and how you see that developing here throughout the rest of the year. It looks like on a sequential basis, it was still weak either way in most of your core pricing gains there. But given the commentary about the volume outlook and the back-half of the year, I would expect that that should start to turn positive. So any thoughts on there would be appreciated? And also the implications for fuel economy, which as we talked about in the past, has been also impacted by adverse mix? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So Brian, I'll jump in here. You're right from a mix -- we did have a little bit better performance there relative to mix, as we saw the coal and the grain continued strong. Whether or not that continues, you've heard Kenny talk about coal staying stable, so that may help us. But our primary efforts relative to fuel consumption are really around how we're running our locomotive fleet, the technology that we're using, and mix is just kind of a benefit sometimes, but not something that we're counting on. We know that we need to drive that change ourselves. In terms of how we look at mix overall for the back-half of the year, we do see some ongoing pressure, particularly with grain. We had very strong grain last year, and so grain plays a big role in that mix. And as I look just at the third quarter, autos could potentially play a role there. It was beneficial a little bit in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, but not sequentially to your point. And so, we're really watching that chip shortage to see what happens with autos. Intermodal is going to stay strong, and we're maybe losing a little bit of the top side there relative to some of these supply chain challenges. But those are the things to watch for, and obviously you guys get good visibility to that throughout the quarter. Brian Ossenbeck : And, specifically on fuel, was there anything that you implemented this quarter was just kind of accumulation of all the initiatives you've been working on? Jennifer Hamann : I don't believe there was anything special that we did this quarter. Eric, I don't know if you want to comment on that. Eric Gehringer : The accumulation of initiatives, and we've talked before about the fact that we've got more than a dozen initiatives. The big ones continue to be our work on modernizing locomotives, implementation of BMS, with 800 more units this year. And even things as we look at continuing to invest in our waste side lubrication, all those point in the direction of being able to continue to become more fuel efficient. Lance Fritz : Hey, Brian, the cool part about that sea rate is it hits two critical buttons for us. It's got a cost impact, maybe more importantly, it's got a greenhouse gas emissions impact. Brian Ossenbeck : Exactly. All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about train lengths. I mean, obviously, you guys continued to improve that meaningfully. So, I guess I'm curious, can we see an acceleration in the pace of improvement in the second-half given the sidings additions? I imagine increased volumes help as well? And I guess can you get to 10,000 feet by Q4 or year-end? And does all of this drive potential upside to the $500 million productivity target for the year? Thank you. Eric Gehringer : Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Allison. So, to your point, yes, the siding extension work was seven completed and 20 more to be completed for the year, at the end of the year, certainly assist us in our efforts to be able to grow train lengths. As I've mentioned before, though, we also have our process improvement, which is really focused on our transportation plan and looking at how we combine trains. I'm not going to guide you to a specific number by the end of the year. What I will certainly tell you, though, is that the entire team understands it's one of our single biggest levers to continue to drive productivity. And we're all focused on it day after day. I'll also point out that as we've been working through some of these transitory events, i.e. the bridge outage on the I-V that will become a temporary headwind to us in the beginning of the third quarter that does not stop all of our efforts, so they continue to grow that through the rest of the year. Allison Landry : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jennifer, you guys referenced some equipment incidents. Is there any way to put some numbers around how much that's costing? And then, when you think about operating ratio and incremental margins, do you think we should see sequential operating ratio improvement as we go into the back-half? And as just the year-over-year trends just start to normalize a little bit, do you think we can maintain this level of incremental margin? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Scott. So, in terms of the equipment incidents, we would kind of put all of our casualty costs together. So yes, we did have some equipment incidents. We have a little bit higher expense, in terms of some of our environmental and personal injury accruals. And I'd say all in that cost is probably about a nickel on the quarter. So that's how I would size that. In terms of the operating ratio and margins, our incremental margins in the second quarter 78%, very strong. I think we can maintain that pace through the back-half. If you think about our operating ratio guidance, though, the 56.5% just mathematically, that would say that we're not probably going to see sequential level improvements. We do have tougher comps, as we move into the back-half of 2021. And we see volumes being, I'll say kind of flattish sequentially. If we can get some upside there, obviously, that could help as well. Lance Fritz : Yeah. I just want to point out, Jennifer, that 55.1, 55x are terrific operating ratios. We're not satisfied. It's not like we're going to camp out there if there's an opportunity to improve, but that\u2019s a hell of a performance. Jennifer Hamann : No, absolutely. And of course, that all goes into our longer-term guidance that you're aware of Scott, in terms of getting to that 55 next year, and then having long-term incrementals in the mid to high 60s. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Lance and Jen, if I could just follow-up on that incremental comment, right. So, if you think about the second-half, you're increasing your volume target, yet you're kind of maintaining the DLR target at that 56.5. So, just want to walk through kind of the leverage you see on the network. If you've got room still, you've been in 180,000 weekly carloads. You mentioned down at 163,000. So it still seems like you've got operational room for benefit. You should have fuel catching up in the second-half after getting a negative in the current quarter. So, is there anything that wouldn't lead to a better than the 56.5 target that you've got, given the additional 100 basis points of volumes? Lance Fritz : Ken, you're kind of painting us into a corner there. I'm going to start and say the full year operating ratio, of course incorporates the first quarter, which I think was a 60 dot something. And there's also the headwinds that Jennifer mapped out. There are tailwinds, but we got to be balanced in our perspective in terms of recognizing. There's some headwinds that are going to be showing up in the second-half. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And to your point Ken, we did up our volume outlook. But if you look at that, that really says we're pretty flat from where we're at today in terms of ending the second quarter out through the end of the year. And July is off to a bit of a slower start, which isn't unusual. You've got the 4th of July holiday, but right now our seven day run rate for July is kind of the high 150. So we've got to see that pickup. And obviously some of these transitory issues that are going on in the intermodal space are having an impact on that top-line. So I feel very good, 56.5 would be a record performance and sets us up great going forward. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks. Lance Fritz : All right. Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Hi. Yeah. Given this still very solid demand and some of the congestion issues, can you maybe reiterate your thoughts around resourcing, specifically headcount and maybe touch a little bit on other inflationary cost pressures that may be lurking that you referenced second-half headwinds? Obviously, congestion is some of it perhaps costs as well. Thanks. Lance Fritz : Just to be clear, I think we've said this, maybe even in our prepared comments that as we look into the second-half, our headcount right now is about 30,000 employees, and it's going to stay around in that ballpark, as we look out into what we think the demand profile is going to be. We're going to have to hire here and there to fill in vacancies or take care of attrition. But, we don't see any significant hiring program or headwind in that headcount number. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah, that's exactly right, Lance. So with regard to inflation, Jordan, you might recall, our full year guidance relative to 2021 inflation is 2.25%. We still feel good with that. When you think about materials costs, those are largely contracted and that really flows through our capital line. Obviously, our wages are set for the year. And other purchase services, we do those on contractual basis as well. We'll look and see what inflation looks like next year. Certainly, it's setting up that that might be greater. But in terms of how we're looking at 2021, we're still good with that initial guidance. Jordan Alliger : And just as a quick follow-up, maybe you said this before, can you give the dollar amount for the real estate gain and the tax benefit? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : The dollar amount for the real estate gain, I think I have that right in front of my head. It was $0.13 together between real estate and the taxes is what the gain was. And of course, you'll recall that last year, we had an $0.08 benefit from real estates. So net-net, those came down to a $0.05 good guide. Jordan Alliger : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe we talk a little bit about the productivity outlook for the rest of the year, maybe you could help us kind of give a little bit of color around the various buckets and maybe where do you see the better opportunities in the back-half of the year? And then how does kind of service sort of play in with that opportunity to get obviously a little bit more than half for the rest of the year? Just kind of curious if that service dynamic kind of make that a little bit more challenging to get, or are there other sort of areas of momentum that kind of make you feel pretty good about that $500 million? Lance Fritz : Eric, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Eric Gehringer : Sure. So we did reaffirm the fact that we're still targeting $500 million. Regarding your question about the service and thinking about some of the transitory events we've shared, I'll just give you one example. I mentioned before, train length is a large productivity driver for us. And as a result of some of the transitory events, we've had to be intentional with actually reducing train length temporarily, and a couple trains as we think about getting them on a different reroute path than they would normally go. So, certainly you could consider that to be a headwind. You still have a whole team of people here that are committed with a number of different initiatives to still drive towards that $500 million by the end of the year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. James McGarragle : Hey, this is James McGarragle. I'm on for all Walter Spracklin this morning. Appreciate you taking my questions. My question was on the pricing environment, kind of how sustainable you believe it is going to be longer-term? Are you seeing the opportunity to lock in higher rates for longer with customers that want to increase certainty of real capacity? Kenny Rocker : Yeah, thanks for that. I don't think I'm prepared to go out and forecast how long we think that strength will be there. What I will talk about is the fact that, as we do have this reliable service product that Eric has put out in front of us, along with some of the market dynamics on the truck inside it, it clearly has afforded us the opportunity to go out there and take some pretty robust pricing to the market. But as it stands now, I would expect that the favorable pricing environment withstand, at least throughout this year, and then we'll see what happens if we turn a corner in the next year. Lance Fritz : And you said something important, Kenny, that I want to make sure we don't miss on the call. We've talked about the transitory issues that we've gotten in the network, we showed some of the service reflections of that. But PSR and the fact that we've transformed our railroad has us in a whole different ballpark of performance than these kinds of issues would have us in three, four, five years ago. And we shouldn't miss that. We're not proud of it. We know we have an opportunity and an expectation to improve and improve rapidly, when for instance, we get the bridge back, et cetera. But the overall performance, like we showed from \u201819 to \u201821, is fundamentally difference under our PSR transformation. Kenny Rocker : Lance, when we're talking to our customers, they certainly respect the recoverability, beat of recoverability that we have today that we didn't have a few years ago. Lance Fritz : Yeah. James McGarragle : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, guys, thanks for the time. So Lance, we heard the word transitory a couple times here around the issue of service disruptions. I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. We heard from one of the other we did today that there's actually some issues, staffing the railroad, getting resources to come back off of the inactive boards, maybe even having to kind of reach into the checkbook and put some labor incentives out there. I'd love to kind of get your perspective on the ability to add resource to the extent that we see a better stronger demand environment? Kenny\u2019s teams do well, sort of convincing people to use the rail? How do you feel about the friction cost that might come if we actually do end up in a better demand environment? Lance Fritz : That's a great question, David. And I certainly hope we do end up with a better volume environment, and it just forces us to keep bringing more resources. Let's start with labor, right now, we're really not seeing substantial problems hiring labor. We've got a couple of issues with very different skill sets, most of those are in our non-agreement workforce, like data scientists or machine learning scientists. But when it comes to hire and TE&Y, the core team that actually runs our transportation product, there might be a spot like LA where it's relatively harder to hire than somewhere else. But it's not -- we're not yet in a place where we think that's an impediment. We don't have to do anything at this moment special to try to attract people to the jobs. Now, longer-term, for sure, we do have initiatives and understand that we've got to make our jobs more attractive over time, so that we can continue to attract a really big pool to our jobs. And that includes our national negotiation on right now, where we think taking somebody out of a capital locomotive and putting them on the ground, actually makes the job more attractive. It makes it a job that stays at home and turns it into shift work. So that kind of answers your labor question. Other assets, we think about bringing locomotives out to support the network. We're actually doing that right now because the reroutes require more power. And some of those locomotives are a little more costly to repair and get into operating condition. But again, that's a temporary thing. Once those reroutes are done, and we're able to get the network back to its normal routing, those locomotives are going to go right back into storage. So, I just don't see anything other than maybe the international intermodal issue that looks like it's going to last for a little while, until demand and supply gets balanced. That's really going to get in the way. Jennifer Hamann : I was just going to add to that, we still have about 800 or 900 folks on the team in Y-sides that are furloughed, and a larger number on the mechanical and engineering side. So that's always our first draw to the extent we can. And now some of those folks have been off for quite a while, but our retention rate is still I think, kind of 70% or so. So, still a pretty good hit rate there. David Vernon : That's great. I guess, maybe just as a follow-up, you guys had talked about opening up some new intermodal services, new terminal, things like that. Has the issues that you're dealing with in terms of the international intermodal sort of impacted the ability to ramp up the pop up facility in Minnesota, the new facility in LA? Is there any sort of delay in that domestic growth story that we should be expecting because of a knock on effect from the temporal disruption of international? Kenny Rocker : David, this is Kenny. We've been very excited. You look at Inland Empire, we've got a small group of customers that have been there. We started up in call it, I think it was June 21, and started our first units on the 22nd, and that's been growing. We share the run rate at the Investor Day where we see that. And then the same is true with Twin Cities, that started the first week in January. We've seen the volume increase throughout the year. We've seen more customers attracted to that product. So, on both fronts, we\u2019re encouraged and we have not seen aside from call it some of the wildfires, we haven't seen really anything structural impact that in a negative light. David Vernon : Alright. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. Maybe a two part question for Eric. I was wondering if you could provide your thoughts around the progression of trip plan compliance, as we get into the back-half of the year. And then Kenny, any update on new business wins either from truckload or some of your rail competitors? And how that could influence volumes in the quarters ahead? Eric Gehringer : So, I'll start. So if you look at the bridge outage in Northern California combined with the wildfires east of there, we've done the work to see the impact of TPC, and you're talking about five to eight points in percentage increase in that metric. After that, what's ahead of us, Justin is really our continued work on variability reduction, looking at every opportunity, as we think about dwelling terminals, as we think about train stops online a road, how do we understand how to avoid those in the future, and then putting up either new process or new mechanism in this place to do that. So still lots of work ahead of us, still a team focused very critically on ensuring that we return the service to what our customers expect. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Thanks for that question. Yeah, we've been able to secure quite a bit of business that has been moving over the road. You think about some of the products like lumber and paper, we've been encouraged there. We just talked about the Inland Empire and the Twin Cities and the benefits that we've seen there. I think one of the things that have really opened up for us with this lower cost structure and more reliable services, really some of the markets that were shorter distances that might have been call it less than 500 miles. We've seen tremendous uptick there. And then we're excited about the pizza business that we will see come onto our line next year. We got an opportunity to meet with the Knight-Swift folks, and we're impressed with their management team, and leadership team. So we're looking forward to growth here in the near-term and the future. The demand is strong, and we want to take advantage of it. Justin Long : Okay. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, Lance and the rest of the team. I wanted to talk a little bit about conversations with shippers. As we look out to the future obviously, the executive order was a lot less worse than I think the original Wall Street Journal article had some of us believe, but it does sort of bring the rails back in the spotlight with potential increased regulations. Is that going to change any of the discussions that you guys think you're going to have going on into the future with some shippers? I\u2019ve spoken to a few which I think are thinking about bringing it up when they renegotiate their next contracts. I'm just trying to think this through, because clearly, we're starting to see some rail cost inflation in here. And you guys are going to need to push rates even higher to get that same spread going forward. How should we think about this as we look out into 2022? Lance Fritz : Jason, this is Lance. Let me take a first stab at how we think about the EO and the relationship to the STB, where you're really talking about regulation, and then maybe some of the rest of the team have perspective on it. So baseline, you know that railroads perform a critical function in the economy. We provide affordable shipping for bulk products in large volume. We provide really high paying union jobs. We help people reduce their carbon intensity and their carbon emissions. And we do all of that investing in our own infrastructure. So we're a solution to a number of the things that the current administration emphasize across their different departments, their different functions. And we think when we look at the EO, the EO really needs to be looked through the lens of all of government perspective. There's some things in the EO that looked like they would fight against initiatives that the Department of Transportation, the EPA, OMB, Amtrak, are trying to accomplish with the help of freight railroads. So number one is we're trying to help all of the administration understand the impact of some of what they've got inside the EO in terms of urging the STB to reregulate the railroad. And so, stepping back a little further, we've been helping the STB see the impact of potential regulation and the multiplicity of regulation, and the retarding impact that could have on our ability, for instance, to help relieve highways, to take trucks off the highway and bring them onto the railroad, to continue to help industries reduce their greenhouse gas footprints. And doing it all with an ability to invest in our own infrastructure. So this just says we've got continued work to do. I don't think it's more work, I don't think it's a unique set of new work. It's the same work we've been doing for years and years, helping the STB understand when they regulate what the negative impacts could be if they get it wrong. Kenny Rocker : And all I add is, we have customers that from time to time will ask us what we think of the EO discussion, and we reflect the comments that Lance just mentioned. But we haven't seen any of our customers try to insert that into negotiations of our business. Jason Seidl : Lance, well put and Kenny, thank you for that color. One quick follow-up on all this. Kenny, as you look at the service product, and as you start to clear up some of the bottlenecks. I mean, clearly, it's a compelling one to take some trucks off of the road. But one thing also when I speak to railroad shippers, supply chain visibility always comes into play. And we're seeing some improvement, I think across the railroad space. Can you update us on what UP is doing to increase the supply chain visibility for the shippers? Kenny Rocker : Yeah, so a number of things. We've been pretty aggressive on that front. And Rahul Jalali, our new CIO has really sparked that too. We've been what I'll call overzealous in terms of API development for our customers. We have a significant number of our customers that are utilizing APIs now. And the value of doing that is not just what we're pushing for is not just on our rail line, but also from an inner line basis. I talked a little bit earlier about the fact that even on our international intermodal side, that we work with the ports also so that we can see inside the terminals and what's coming to them, it\u2019s a key focus. The other part of that is customers want visibility, they also want to know what's going to happen if there is a disruption or something that is going to happen next. And we've been working with operating also make sure we have proactive feedback from a technology perspective there. So, we feel really good about the visibility that we've inserted, and that we're providing customers. And clearly, for the customers that are not as sophisticated, there's room for us to share that more with the receiver. We feel good about the work we've done with the larger customers. Lance Fritz : Yeah, Jason, very clearly, there's a strategic imperative that's right in front of us in the international intermodal supply chain. More transparency, more coordination across the whole supply chain, probably would be addressing the issues that we've got today in advance. And so, there's an imperative there, we see it, we're positioned to take care of it with our product portfolio and our platforms, and we're going after it. Jason Seidl : That's great news, for sure. Appreciate the update, guys. Thanks as always. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, thanks, everybody. So, I just had a couple quick ones. One is, we talked a lot about pricing, but I don't think you guys mentioned where we are actually in the pricing cycle. There's obviously inflation everywhere in the freight economy. I think it just be helpful to understand how closely your book of business today reflects the current market dynamics? And what the runway is on that, if you can just update us on that? And then, Kenny, there's just a lot of growth coming from intermodal, and that seems to be the place of secular growth. I think, you mentioned you won the contract with Knight-Swift as well. The issue with that is, as you know better than I do, there's extra costs that come with that growth. There's lower revenue intensity, if I can call it that way, associated with intermodal. There are other rails there's one particular other rail that's kind of proactively trying to balance out that secular mix dynamic through acquisitions, trucking company, for example. What can you do aside from riding the wave of industrial production growth? And there's going to be a wave over the next couple of years. But aside from that, what can you do proactively to lean into some of the higher value carloads that offset some of the intermodal headwinds the mixed drag that you have? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Kenny, do you want to take all of that? Jennifer Hamann : Well, let me jump in, I'll give the first part just to remind the focus and stats in terms of what our portfolio looks like and what we can touch. So, if you look at our revenue portfolio, about 45% is under multi-year deals. And there's some amount of assets turning on an annual basis. But then, we have about 30%, that's one year contracts or less than duration, and then about 25% that's kind of our tariff or spot business. And that's primarily in some of the construction products and grain. So, think of our portfolio in that sense and you think about kind of pricing cycle. And then Kenny, I\u2019ll let you add. Amit Mehrotra : But the 30%, is the 30% rerate towards the end of the year or for the year? How does that 30% breakdown? Lance Fritz : Across the year. Jennifer Hamann : Across the year, yeah. Amit Mehrotra : Got you. Okay. Kenny Rocker : Yeah, just real quick. All I can tell you is that we have seen acceleration from the book of business that we have been able to touch. Jennifer talked about that, we think if we've been able to achieve more price on that as we move throughout the year. The larger question that you asked about growing that business faster than industrial production, which we've committed to over the long-term, we feel very confident about the products that we have within our loop network. We dray a tremendous amount of business. We do a lot of trains loading for customers.  We're playing in those areas today. So it's not something that we cannot do. We're also providing whether you call it team tracks that are out there, whether you call it added services with chopping up some of the wood or aggregating some of the cement and rock. We want to continue to build that out and provide more of those services. And to someone that asked a little bit earlier provide a little bit more of that shipment visibility to make it stickier for our customers to move on ourselves. So, that's something that we will continue to do. That's something that we have to do. We have to make sure that to the customer we look not just only like a railroad but a logistics transportation provider. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Congrats on the results. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much, and good morning. Just a question on grain, you highlighted in your comments tight grain supply in Q3 and typical comps in Q4. But the outlook for grain and grain products is still characterized as positive overall. So, just hoping for a bit more color there? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : All I\u2019m saying is that demand is strong for grain. It was very strong the back-half of last year. So, to be above those comps are going to be pretty challenging. But, we feel very positive and have a positive outlook about that demand and being able to capture it. And working with Eric\u2019s team, we want to maximize all the volume that's out there. Lance Fritz : Yeah, demand looks pretty strong, Kenny. We're kind of starting to shift over to what's the crop going to look like that we serve. Cherilyn Radbourne : That's all from me. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much, and congratulations. A question for Jen, you mentioned that you're targeting about $7 billion in free cash on the year, which is amazing. And you did about $3 billion in the first-half of the year, so that implies $4 billion in the second-half of the year. So about $500 million a quarter give or take extra. But the operating profits are not rising by that much, if I look at the updated guidance on margins and volumes. So could you help me understand what's occurring that's helping drive a little more that free cash flow generation in the second-half of the year? Jennifer Hamann : Well, Jeff, just to clarify, when we talked about the $7 billion that's related to share repurchases, not working cash flow generation. Jeff Kauffman : Oh, okay. Jennifer Hamann : And, and as you know, we are using our balance sheet and our EBITDA growth to be able to fund some of those share repurchases. So, I referenced we did the $2 billion in May, and that was funded through debt issuance. So, we do see cash growing. Some of that in terms of the free cash flow fall is impacted by the fact that we did have, and I mentioned this in my remarks, taxes year-over-year relative to the Cares Act are higher and impacting some of that free cash flow a little bit more. But the comments on the $7 billion were specific to share repurchases. Jeff Kauffman : Now that answers my question. I just couldn't get the math to work. So thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of a question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in October to discuss our third quarter results. Until then, I wish everyone good health. Take care and goodbye. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific 's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific 's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. During the quarter, the Union Pacific team dealt with multiple network disruptions that required us to rebuild bridges, reroute trains, and connect more closely with other links in the supply chain to support and to serve our customers. While we still have work ahead, our employees' dedication is a critical success factor in navigating all of those challenges. Turning to our third quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2021 third quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to $1.4 billion or $2.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Despite the network and global supply chain challenges, our quarterly operating ratio of 56.3% improved 240 basis points versus last year and represents a third quarter record. We also set third quarter records in Operating income, net income, and earnings per share. The team did an excellent job of managing the business to produce strong results. A comparison to 2019, a period with higher volumes, further highlights our performance and demonstrates our focus on driving productivity and network efficiency to overcome external factors. We also continue to make progress on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint. The team achieved strong productivity to brew some all-time quarterly record low fuel consumption rate. This represented a 1% improvement versus 2020 and helped our customers eliminate 5.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the quarter by using Union Pacific versus truck. Momentum is building. And before the end of the year, we plan the detail our emissions reduction plan with the release of our initial climate action plan. So let's start the morning with Kenny for an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance and good morning. Before I talk about our market performance, I want to thank our operating team for their tireless efforts this past summer to recover the network from the devastating forest fires in California. Focusing back on our review of the business, our Third Quarter volume was flat compared to a year-ago. Gains in our bulk and industrial segments were driven by market strength and our business development efforts. Those gains were offset by declines in our premium business group, as our served markets continue to be impacted by semiconductor chip shortages and global supply chain disruptions.  However, freight revenue was up 12% driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains, and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting out with our bulk commodities, revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to last year, driven by a 4% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting strong core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Coal and renewable carloads grew 9% year-over-year, and 17% from the second quarter. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand, as a result of higher natural gas prices, coupled with increased coal exports.  Grain and grain products were down 1% compared to last year, and down 9% from the Second Quarter due primarily to lower U.S. grain stocks. However, this was partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for bio-fuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 10% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased export potash shipments. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was flat year-over-year and sequentially from the Second Quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue improved 22% for the quarter, driven by our 14% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% driven by higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains, and positive mix. Energy and specialized shipments were up 16% compared to last year, and up 5% versus the Second Quarter.  The gains were due to an increase in petroleum products as demand recovers from this time last year, and new business wins from Mexico Energy Reform. Volume from Forest Products grew 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by demand for brown paper using corrugated boxes, along with strong housing starts, driving lumber shipments. However, compared to the Second Quarter, volume was down 2% due to the impact of the Lapa fire in Northern California. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business wins as production rate for plastics improved from 2020. Metals and minerals volume was up 21% compared to 2020 and up 3% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by our business development efforts, along with strong steel demand.  As industrial markets recover, coupled with favorable comps for frac sand. Turning now with premium, revenue for the quarter was up 1% as the 9% decrease in volume was more than offset by higher average revenue per car. ARC increased by 11% from higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was down 18% compared to last year and down 4% versus the Second Quarter, semiconductor shortages had an adverse impact to both our finished vehicles and auto parts business segments. Inter-modal volume decreased 6% year-over-year and 8% compared to the second quarter. International volumes continue to face challenges from global supply chain disruption. With regards to domestic, strong demand and new business wins were also hampered by supply chain disruptions. Plus e-commerce business saw tough comps versus last year. Now, looking ahead to the Fourth Quarter of 2021, starting out with our bulk commodities, we're optimistic about grain business due to another strong harvest and grain export demand. Also, grain products will continue to benefit from growth of the bio-fuel markets. Food and refrigerated volumes should be positive with increased consumer demand, post-pandemic restaurant re-openings, and truck penetration growth. Lastly, we expect coal to remain strong for the remainder of the year based on our current natural gas futures, inventory replenishment, as well as export demand. Looking at our industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many bar markets, like metals and florin (ph). The year-over-year comp for our energy markets are favorable. However, we expect narrow spreads will negatively impact crude by rail shipments. But on a positive note, we expect to mitigate the lower crude shipments with strength and other petroleum and LPG products. And lastly, for premiums, we anticipate continued challenges in automotive related to semiconductor shortages for the fourth quarter. In regards to intermodal, limited truck capacity, inventory, restocking, and strength in retail sales will continue to drive intermodal demand in the fourth quarter. However, we expect international volumes to be constrained as ocean carriers have recently taken additional actions to speed up their container returns as challenges in labor, port capacity, warehouses, and in drayage persist. And on the domestic side, opportunities will face continued supply chain challenges with limited hallway capacity and floor chassis turn time. Overall, I'm encouraged by the opportunities in front of us for the rest of 2021. But more importantly, I want to recognize the commercial team as they continue to focus on providing solutions for our customers to win in the marketplace. As we head into 2022, our commercial team is driving growth through new business wins. Most notably, we're taking more trucks off the road in all three of our business groups. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Kenny. And good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire operating department for their dedication and hard work to manage through the challenges we've faced during the quarter. From wildfires to mudslides and hurricanes, the team demonstrated perseverance to restore our network and deliver strong financial results. In addition, as Kenny just described, the demand picture is turned out differently than we expected at the beginning of the year. Working closely with marketing, the operating team has adjusted transportation plans and added resources into the network for surging demand in coal, metals, lumber, and green.  These actions demonstrate the agility and strength of our franchise. Take a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on Slide 9, driven by wildfires and weather events during the quarter, our freight car velocity and trip plant compliance metrics deteriorated compared to 2020. Freight car velocity decreased due to increased terminal dwell and higher operating inventory levels, which led to lower trip planned compliance results. Our entire team has been fully engaged on restoring network fluidity and the recovery is progressing. We are seeing improvement in our metrics with reduced operating car inventory and improved freight car velocity. Our reported weekly metrics showed the time required to recover the network from these events. While we made improvements from our freight car velocity, weekly low of 184 in August to 210 miles per day in the last two weeks of September, our goal remains to return freight car velocity towards 220 miles per day. Our intermodal trip plan compliance results improved an August low of 61% to gain 12 points in September to 73%. Our manifest and auto TripLink compliance results improved from 57% in August to 61% in September. We recognize improving TripLink compliance is critical to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy.  We have maintained higher crew and locomotive resources in the short-term to assist in reducing excess car inventories to drive increased fluidity. As Operating car inventory declines, we will quickly adjust resources to current volume levels. Our cooperation and work with partners at the West Coast ports have reduced rail container dwell back to more normal levels. And with the Biden administration's efforts to expand operations at the ports to ease congestion, we stand ready to move more rail containers, provided that points further along the supply chain can handle increased volume. While there's still work to be done, the team is confident in our ability to restore service to the levels our customers expect and deserve. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to make good progress on our efficiency initiatives. However, disruptions during the quarter impacted these results as well. Locomotive productivity declined 8% compared to a year-ago as we deployed additional resources to handle traffic reroutes. Our record third quarter workforce productivity was driven by efficiencies and our engineering, mechanical and management work forces, and offset slightly by increases in train and engine workforce to address our network recovery. We continued our focus on increasing train length, achieving a 4% improvement since third quarter 2020 to approximately 9,360 feet. Now that the bridge has been restored, the team has again, driving productivity through increasing Train Link, as evidenced in our September train linked growth to over 9,500 feet. Turning to slide 11, our ability to grow Train Link has also enabled by the completion of 9 sidings to date in 2021 with an additional 26 under construction or in the final planning stages. These investments will enable a more reliable and efficient service product for future growth. We also produced a record quarterly fuel consumption rate, improving 1% compared to last year.  Through productivity initiatives and technology improvements, we were able to offset most of the inefficiencies stemming from the wildfires. The operating department understands the importance we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals and have more work underway. Our approach is multi-pronged, with the primary emphasis around our locomotive fleet, both looking at alternative energies as well as biofuels. As we drive productivity and manage the various network challenges in 2021, the health and safety of our workforce is paramount. Although our year-to-date employee safety results have not shown improvement in 2020, recent monthly trends provide positive momentum for the team to build upon. Again, our approach is across a number of fronts, including employee engagement, broader deployment of technology, as well as looking externally for best practices. Additionally, we reduced cost of rail equipment incidents during the quarter. We are encouraged by the improvement, but know that we must maintain focus on promoting a safe working environment to reduce employee injuries so everyone goes home safe each day. Safe operations also have a direct impact on our service product, so this work will benefit all stakeholders. Wrapping up on slide 12, as we look to close out 2021, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to improve safety, increased network fluidity, improve our service product, and drive productivity as we support business growth with our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific achieved strong third quarter financial results with earnings per share of $2.57, and an operating ratio of 56.3%. As noted in an 8-K last month, we incurred additional expenses this quarter related to wildfires and weather. The full impact of those events, including lost revenue, negatively impacted our operating ratio 50 basis points and earnings per share by $0.05. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter negatively impacted operating ratio by a 140 basis points.  However, the Year-over-year impact of our fuel surcharge programs added $0.05 to EPS. Setting aside these exogenous issues, UPS core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 430 basis points and added $0.56 to EPS. Our performance demonstrates the resiliency and efficiency built into our franchise through PSR, even when operating in less-than-ideal conditions. Looking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing the comparisons to both Third Quarter 2020 as well as Third Quarter 2019. The comparison of 2021 to 2019 most clearly illustrates the efficiency we've achieved over the past two years as we generated 9% higher Operating income on 4% less volumes. For third quarter 2021, operating revenue up 13% and operating expense only up 9%.  We generated a third quarter record operating income of $2.4 billion. Net income of $1.7 billion, and earnings per share also were third quarter records. Looking more closely at third quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue. Both year-over-year and sequentially versus the second quarter. Freight revenue totaled $5.2 billion in the third quarter, up 12% compared to 2020 and 1% compared to the second quarter. Looking first at the year-over-year analysis, although volume was flat, the overall demand environment remains strong and supports pricing actions that yield dollars exceeding inflation. On a year-over-year basis, those gains were further supplemented by a positive business mix driving 650 basis points in total improvement. For Intermodal shipments combined with higher industrial shipments, drove that positive mix. Fuel surcharges increased freight revenues 600 basis points compared to last year as our fuel surcharge programs continue to chase rising fuel prices. Looking at freight revenue sequentially, lower volume versus the Second Quarter, decreased rate revenue 250 basis points highlighted by the factors that Kenny highlighted. Continued core pricing gains and a more positive business mix, increased freight revenue, 175 basis points on a sequential basis, driven by that same combination of higher industrial carloads and lower intermodal shipments.  Finally, rising fuel prices and the resulting uptick in sequential fuel surcharges increased freight revenue, 125 basis points. Now let's move onto Slide 17, which provides a summary of our Third Quarter operating expenses, which increased 9% in total versus 2020. The primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 81% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. A small offset to the higher prices was a 1% improvement in our fuel consumption rate. Better efficiency was a product of both our business mix and productivity initiatives, which offset inefficiencies associated with wildfires in the quarter. Looking further at the other expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 3% versus 2020. Third Quarter workforce levels were down 1% compared to last year, despite our trained and engine workforce growing 3%. This increase reflects the additional crews needed to navigate the network impact from bridge outages and weather. Management, engineering, and mechanical work forces together decreased 3%. Wage inflation along with higher re-crew and overtime costs associated with our network issues, increased cost per employee 4%, while still a tad elevated, this level of per employee compensation increase is more in line with future expectations. Purchased services and materials expense was flat as higher locomotive and freight car maintenance associated with the larger access fleet was offset by reduced contractor expense. And with automotive shipments forecasted to remain soft for at least the balance of the year. We now expect purchase services and material expense to only be up low-single-digits for full-year versus 2021. Equipment and other flat consistent with volumes. Other expense decreased 10% or $29 million this quarter, driven primarily by lower write-offs of in-progress capital projects in 2021. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, recall that last year we incurred a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment charge in this expense category. Looking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18, operating challenges during the quarter again impacted our productivity, which totaled $45 million. In total for 2021, productivity is at $280 million, led by our Train Link improvements and locomotive productivity offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds. Our incremental margins in the quarter were very strong, 94% driven by solid pricing gains, positive business mix, as well as continued efficiency. PSR clearly gives us a platform to add volumes to our network in an extremely efficient manner. Turning to slide 19, year-to-date cash from operations increased to $6.5 billion from $6 billion in 2020, a 9% increase. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 95% and year-to-date free cash flow increased $728 million or 38% driven by higher net income and lighter year-to-date capital spend compared to last year.  Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances, we've returned $7.9 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share repurchases. Actions taken during the year include, increasing our industry-leading dividend by 10% in May and repurchasing 27.5 million shares totaling $5.9 billion. We finished the Third Quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to - EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, which is on par with Second Quarter. We remain committed to returning great value to our owners and are demonstrating that again this year. Wrapping things up on slide 20, as you heard from Kenny, the overall economic environment remains positive and provides confidence for the future growth of our Company. Bulk is driven by strong gear -- grain volumes and coal continue to exceed expectations.  Industrial volumes remain consistent and strong across many sectors like forest products, metals, and plastics. So we are bullish on several fronts. But as you are also well aware, headwinds in autos and intermodal persists. Global supply chain disruptions, semiconductor shortages, and the additional pressure with international intermodal volumes that Kenny just described, continued to constrain our premium volumes. So balancing these variables, and with just over two months left in the year, we now expect volume to be up closer to 5% for full year 2021. We are also adjusting our productivity guidance for the year down to $350 million as the weather impact and related network challenges impede the progress, we expect to make with our efficiency in 2021.  To put that in context, however, at the end of this year, we will have generated almost $1.8 billion of productivity since our implementation of PSR in late 2018, so great work overall by the team. And more importantly, this lower cost structure and improved service product provides Union Pacific the foundation for future growth and strong incremental margins. Lower expectations for volume and productivity are headwinds to our 2021 operating goal. In addition, we've seen fuel prices continue to rise in pressure margins. In fact, over the last 30 days, barrel prices have increased around $10 with spot diesel prices up over $0.25 per gallon. Offsetting some of this margin pressure is a positive business mix and strong pricing environment. So all-in, we now expect our full-year operating ratio improvement to be in the neighborhood of a 175 basis points. While not quite to the high end of the guidance range we established back in January, we view that level of improvement as another great milestone on our journey to 55.x operating ratio in 2022, especially in light of the unexpected headwinds we've had to overcome to get here. Wrapping it up, it was a tough quarter operationally, yet we made great strides to strengthen our franchise and achieved solid results. In fact, we stand poised to finish 2021 as Union Pacific s most profitable year ever. That achievement would not be possible without our tremendous employees who are on the frontline every day serving our customers safely and efficiently while producing these record results. My thanks go out to team UP. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. One area of continued focus by the team, as you've heard us talk about this morning, is safety. While our Safety metrics lagged 2020, there are some positive signs including strong September results that indicate we're taking the right actions to produce desired long-term results. The entire team understands that safety is foundational to everything we do at Union Pacific. Our service product has shown improvement over the past 60 days, but there's still work to be done.  With increasing volumes related to the grain harvest and intermodal peak season approaching, we understand the importance of delivering for our customers. The opportunity to provide freight solutions to our customers is strong and gives us confidence that our long-term goals for growth remain intact. And as you heard from Kenny, even with macroeconomic headwinds, we're winning with our customers. While supply chain disruptions will likely persist into next year, we see our third quarter and year-to-date results as proof of our team's ability to perform in the face of significant challenges. As headwinds turn to tailwinds, we're well-positioned to build off our success and deliver even more value to our stakeholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time so that we can accommodate as many analysts as possible, we would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please, proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks, morning guys. So Jennifer, you've been highlighting strong incremental margins year-to-date, I guess I'm wondering why that doesn't continue in the Fourth Quarter if the guidance implies a flattish OR despite some really good pricing, anything 4Q, had some onetime bonuses a year ago. So maybe just some thoughts on why the incremental aren't better in Fourth Quarter? And does this in any way change the outlook on the 55 OR for 2022? Jennifer Hamann : Well, let me start with that second part Scott, because it in no way changes how we're looking at 2022. We absolutely believe we will still achieve those targets in 2022, consistent with what we talked about in our May Analyst Meeting. In terms of some of the pressures year-over-year. I mean, it really is a lot driven by fuel. The cost per gallon and if I'm looking at it year-over-year is going to be up anywhere from call it 75 to 80%.  And that's just very tough to overcome, especially with flat volumes, because that's essentially how we're looking at things and you think about our volume guidance in the 5% for full year. So while we're still expecting to be efficient, as we're continuing to resource in the network fluidity that's going to have some pressure on that. And that's what's being reflected in the guidance that we provided there. Scott Group : And just on that's a pressure to the operating ratio, but not necessarily earnings pressure? Jennifer Hamann : Operating ratio pressure, yes. Got it. Thank you. Scott Group : Alright. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Alright. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America, please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit of following up, but Kenny, as you think about that deceleration of 5% growth from 7, which I guess Jen said it's flat, seems like it's 1% growth and maybe a little acceleration in the Fourth Quarter, you maybe talk about puts and takes on that, and more specifically, the Port of L.A. noted, they're seeing some significant rail improvement. Can you talk about if you're able to move the freight, how's the supply chain? Can you get the boxes inland and is there anything improving inland that the warehouses or chassis shortages, especially as we are at peak or moving past peak, are you seeing any improvement in the fluidity there? Thanks. Lance Fritz : All right that's a few questions, a little bit hard. And Eric, you'll help me out a little bit here. So first of all, just walking on our business if you look at it. We expect our coal business to have the same run rates that they have this quarter. You see where the future numbers are. We'll see where that takes us into the first part of 2022. On the grain side, we'd be really happy if we can get to a flattish year-over-year look, we'll see how that plays out. Maybe we get there, if we don't get there, maybe we're up a point or so off. Looking at our Industrial business forward is a lot of opportunities in front of us. I've been really excited about the fact that the commercial team there has been able to win business.  We're seeing it show up on the [indiscernible] on side, as the production rates are going up from earlier in the year. On the metal side also, lot of strong wins, business development wins that we're seeing. It's also showing up. So we're really creating a lot of good things to move in our way. On the forest side, same thing wins from truck -- from paper, wins from truck on the lumber side. We'll see how that plays out. That should really be a positive area for us. But then the wildcard here is on the premium side. You look at auto, I'd tell you, I've forecast this thing wrong in a couple of quarters, I think that -- I believe that we're certainly in the trough. I don't see it really improving in the quarter. We'll see what happens in the next year, maybe some gradual improvement. And then on the international -- intermodal side, Eric and his team have done a great job of really reacting and engaging the terminals at the port and the port. I'm really proud of the fact that we got a product that we've created and Inland Empire can actually capture some of that business that might spill over. You know about the products that we've created up in the 20 cities and we've got our grain facility coming on at G4 to make it just more attractive for customers that really come in and move on the international side and on the domestic side, I'd expect the same run rate that we're seeing today. And we're expecting a tougher comp on our e-commerce businesses we'll have more of a normal Christmas. Eric Gehringer : And Ken, regarding the ports themselves and thinking about our system fluidity, first, it's important that we applaud the same efforts that you did with the effort on both of the ports to move to a 24 by 7 operations. As you think about our fluidity and how we support the middle part and the entire supply chain. You're really thinking about four specific things. The first one is Cardwell, we're back in our 23-to-25-hour historical average, which is 24% better than our peak in July. So we have cars, they're available. From a velocity perspective, how fluid are we from getting point A to point B? We're at 488 miles per day yesterday, which is the best we've been in 9 months. So we have the fluidity to move from A to B.  Where you still see the constraints is in our box slot, we see currently a 40% increase in that dwell versus earlier this year. And then, also on the chassis street time, which is just a measure of how long is a chassis from the time it leaves, to the time it comes back to us. And that's up 20%. So what's critically important as we've identified before, we can take the volume, we can handle the volume efficiently. we need the back end of the supply chain with warehouse capacity, warehouse labor, dray capacity and dray labor to be there to answer that call. We're not doing that, and putting that entirely on the back-end though, we've taken actions even in the last 6 months.  You've heard me talk before about, we know, we've opened G3. We've gone deeper. We've got 5,000 cars now strategically placed. We've extended hours and selected ramps. Most notably, our recent extension to 24-hours in ICTF in L.A. We've also expanded hours for road ability, which is. Matter of expanding hours for the inspection and maintenance of chassis, were being partners with our customers to ensure that anything they can do to continue to improve supply chain fluidity were supported. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks, Kenny and Eric. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC, please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. I guess this question is for Lance and it's a little bit conceptual and it's regarding the supply chain and supply chain issues and whether they are structural or temporary. Effectively, if this is temporary, and we work through the next quarter or two, we don't need to worry about anything, but it seems a little bit more structural. You add in the -- while wildfires can be one-offs, they do recur and can aggravate the supply chain situation.  My question is, if they are structural, Lance, do you look at anything that you can do that, outside of what you're doing for your Company and the things that you can control? There are a lot of aspects with the supply train you can't and you're starting to see your competitors dip into other aspects of non-rail operations. Is this something that even if indeed it is structural and you want to have more handle and the ability to bring other operations in line with your rail operation, could you start looking at acquisitions that are outside of your core rail assets? Lance Fritz : That's a great question, Walter. Let start with structural or temporary. I'm still of the belief that most of what we see is temporary, but that doesn't mean the fundamental basis for your question isn't still appropriate, right? So if we just focus in on the international intermodal supply chain, let's use that as a marker. From a temporary perspective, clearly, COVID and the impacts on labor from many different directions related to the COVID pandemic and reaction to the pandemic over the last 18 months has impacted the labor ability to fill jobs either on the back-end warehouse dray, over in the origin, shutting down factories, ports. And I don't think that lasts forever, right? That certainly strikes me as something that we, the U.S. and the world are going to get our arms around either through mass vaccination, therapeutics, combination of both. So I think ultimately, the way the supply chain is disrupted right now doesn't last.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue to keep our eyes open on opportunities to basically be better for customers. Step one in that, has a lot to do with transparency and visibility in the existing supply chain across partners. We're working very hard in that space with each of the supply chain partners that we have. whether it's a technology platform that we can all use to see everybody's KPIs and current status, or something more. And to your point, from an inorganic growth opportunity perspective, there are probably opportunities in there. And we have talked about that being a juice and augment to our fundamental growth for the railroad and bringing more cars onto the railroad. So I think there are opportunities, they are Walter and we've got our eyes wide open and are looking for them, as we continue to work on the overall supply chain. Walter Spracklin : Really helpful perspective. Thanks, Lance. Lance Fritz : Yep, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. I guess, building on that last question with the CP KCS merger moving forward, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on how this could impact your business. Could you talk about the risks that this deal could pose to either your business or Fairmex's business, given your ownership stake there and how you could potentially mitigate some of those risks? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Great question, Justin. Thank you. So we've been crystal-clear all along that there are a number of concerns we have in terms of maintaining and enhancing competition with this proposed merger. The primary one is making sure that our customers continue to have good commercial access with businesses in Mexico. Today, we appreciate and enjoy about two-thirds or more of all the cross-border rail traffic to and from Mexico. The reason that is, we have the best franchise to both act as an origination for business in Mexico and act as a marketplace for businesses and Mexico. We just want. And to make sure that in the combination of the CP and the KCS, our customers aren't locked out from that access, so we are active in the process right now, to make sure that that concern is known and that it gets addressed in some kind of remedy. I think there are bonafide risks to our business to and from Mexico to maybe the FXE's business. But I think we've got a pretty good beat on them. We understand them and we're actively already working to address them. Justin Long : Okay, thanks. I appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Justin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get your perspective on what innings you think we're in with respect to the pricing opportunity. I think that's an appropriate question given we're baseball playoff season. But I really asked that question because, we saw a nice sequential uplift in intermodal and coal yields. But everything else I would say was a bit muted. I know there's mix within mix that can impact that, but maybe just as a summary, just talk about what inning you think we're in, where you think the biggest opportunities are to see yield improvements from where we are today.  And then just intermodal and coal just took a big step up, is that sustainable in 4Q and as you look at in 2022? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Kenny, you want to take that? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Thanks, Amit, for that question. First, I'll start off by saying that I feel much better about where we are today in terms of our ability to price the product and even earlier in this year, we're looking at the Fourth Quarter. We're going to start bid season here with a small amount of a bid out there, call it 10-15% on a lot of our Intermodal business. Clearly on a lot of our carload business. We're stepping into that. I's a strong environment for us. It's a favorable environment for us. We're going to price to the marketplace. We're in the tight truck capacity. Not just on the Intermodal side, we also see it on the carload side. So we'll have a lot more clarity on it, but I will tell you right now, as I sit here today, it's a favorable environment for us to be pricing in. Amit Mehrotra : So Kenny, you're not going to fight on the inning questions in terms of giving us a number? Kenny Rocker : Well, I'm a college football fan, first of all. But the bottom line is that, hey, look, this is -- it's better than I've seen it in a while. I haven't seen it this strong since the last part of '18. We feel good about the products that we have out there. I've talked about all the new products with Inland Empire in Twin Cities and the network that we have and what Eric is doing to improve the service that you're seeing. It's a favorable environment for us and we feel good about our ability to price into it. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : And thank you, Amit. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup, please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe I can ask a pricing question would be a little bit differently or come at it from a bit of a different perspective You just mentioned, sir not -- if this is probably as good as you've seen since the tail end of 2018, I guess that was really kind of what I was interested if maybe you could put into perspective what we're seeing now from a pricing opportunity to maybe what we saw in 2018. Or maybe going back to 2014 when we had the big uplifts in the pricing dynamic, particularly coming off the back of a very strong truckload market. So do you think that what we're seeing now is sort of commensurate to what we saw back in those other periods? Could this potentially be a little bit better, just given what we're seeing from a supply chain perspective? Any perspective is on -- on that relative to history might be really helpful for us. Kenny Rocker : Yeah, you know, it's totally different reasons. I mean, 2018 was -- the supply chain challenges weren't as holds up as they are today. There are still many things that -- that come into play when you look at what's on the water, what's at the port, street well, and some of the chassis turns. This is a little bit different. In terms of the price and opportunity, I'd say it's still there. I still, again, pretty strong about the opportunities that we have. We get the test awarded here like I mentioned. In the fourth quarter, we've got some large pieces of business that are coming on. We'll see how it plays out, but we're pretty optimistic about what's in front of us. Chris Wetherbee : That's helpful. I appreciate the time guys. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Chris. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen, please, proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the supply chain disruptions as you seem to be one of the main carriers impacted, given your exposure to L.A. and Long Beach. Could you tell us what do you think are the most recent plan by the administration to sort of get through this backlog. I think there's something like $22 billion worth of freight sitting off the shores. And then also, once we do get through that, do you think there could be a lull of freight for short period of time? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Well, yeah, those are great questions, Jason. So the way we think about recovery of current supply chain from my perspective, it really fundamentally boils down to putting people in jobs in order to increase the capacity for handling throughput. And that's both dray drivers, whether you're in the L.A. basin or out in the destination markets and certainly in warehousing and distribution center labor. There might be an opportunity with port labor in terms of being able to maximize throughput through the port, and I know they are talking about that. And so I believe the Biden administration has identified basically increasing the throughput capability and the capacity capability, and understands the need to help put labor that's available into those jobs and make more labor available for the jobs.  Now, in terms of -- once the current supply chain is fixed -- there's some really good-looking markers that tell us the economy is in pretty strong place. And maybe we'll stay there for a while. There's a lot of cash on deposit accounts that people are sitting on. And that is dry powder yet to be deployed in spending. As long as consumers continue to spend on things, That's really good for the goods economy, which of course is the part of the economy that we participate in. And there's also generally -- consumers are generally optimistic.  They're fragile because of the impacts that the COVID pandemic have had on all of us. But they're generally pretty optimistic. And we just need to see, I think, the COVID pandemic get under control and get continued signs of normalcy. And I think consumers will spend that money and the low inventory to sales ratio is going to drive a need for continued stocking. So I feel pretty good about it, certainly as we head into 2022, it looks like a strong environment. Jason Seidl : Lance, I appreciate the color and the believing my kids are trying to support the economy the best they can in spending my money. Lance Fritz : Keep it up. Jason Seidl : I wanted to just follow-up. You talked about labor shortages between dray warehouses and ports. I mean, if you had to rank them, what order would you put them, in terms of what's the biggest problem? Lance Fritz : Yes. Jason, by far, if I could - if we could snap our fingers on the back-end, we would love to see more dray and warehouse distribution capacity. That's the first thing that we would love to see. I think that would fundamentally change street time for chassis and boxes. Jason Seidl : Fantastic. Appreciate the time as always. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. And good morning. Kenny, I think this is for you. At the beginning you mentioned moving coal customers to index-based contracts. And I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on how that creates a win-win for Union Pacific and customers. Kenny Rocker : Yeah, it really just keeps them in the market. It keeps them competitive. Especially, when you have natural gas prices as high as they are. It puts them in the money and we have a really strong service product to support it. We feel good about where that is in the fourth quarter. Probably feel good about where it is in the first quarter and we need to reassess it on a quarterly basis. Cherilyn Radbourne : Maybe just as a quick follow-up. Does that imply that revenue per unit will follow global benchmark prices in some way. Is that how we should think about it? Kenny Rocker : I think that's a safe bet to think that way. Lance Fritz : To a degree, right? Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. Lance Fritz : There's only - Cherilyn to a degree, right. Because there's only a portion of the book of business that's priced that way, but that portion is definitely going to follow that. Cherilyn Radbourne : Fair enough. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays, please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Kenny, you spoke about some business development efforts in your prepared remarks, I think on the AG side Industrial, maybe even Mexico Energy. Can you speak more to that? And I mean, I know you have a pandemic comp this year, but as you look into 2022 and beyond, these the types of things are giving you confidence in that +3% volume outlook long term? Kenny Rocker : Yes, absolutely. I mean, we teamed up at Investor Day, how we thought about the bio-fuel market. One of the things that I'm proud of that vaulting for it, that they develop that market. I mean, you look at the Midwest and some of these central states, we've got a unique opportunity where we originate that business. And then we have another unique opportunity in some cases where we might be able to move some of that product to the end market. So we're going out from a business development standpoint and just developing that business.  As you look at our industrial side, same thing too. If you look at Mexico Energy Reform, team has just done a fabulous job of just walking down that portfolio and growing that business. We have clear line of sight to the players that can get in those markets, and we're helping them grow. On the premium side, We've got [indiscernible] to upcoming in January 1st and we're fired up about it. There are some other areas again, that we have just gone out and created those markets, and so we're excited about it. We do feel -- I'm bullish. We feel very strong going into next year. Lance Fritz : Brandon, I want to brag on not just Kenny and the commercial team, but the cooperation between Kenny and the operating team and all the other internal support mechanisms that make that business development efforts happen. They're going after business in so many different ways, whether it's campaigns to fill out, shorter trains on the network or to attack a particular marketplace that looks like it's growing. And we want to be a bigger part of it. Or where there's customers that have a real problem with their cost structure and we know bringing some of that business onto the rail will enhance their ability to compete in their marketplace. All of the above is generating business development. It's happening mostly in singles and doubles. But I'll take lots of singles and doubles in a team that's oriented towards making that happen. Jennifer Hamann : Well, we saw that show up in the industrial space this quarter, talking about being able to really capitalize and jump in where we saw some hot markets. Kenny and the team did it and then Eric and team moved it. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Brandon Oglenski : All right, guys. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan, please, proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask Eric about the operations side and maybe about steps getting productivity and service consistency back on track. And what's still sounds like it's going to be a pretty volatile volume in potentially operating environment. So train lengths were down for the first time that we can really find on record, but they were improving in September.  So maybe you can touch on that in terms of how you can maintain that momentum, even if volumes are flat. And then, just if you can also touch on what else is in your control, the sea rate on fuels, obviously moving in the right direction. Is there anything else specifically on the initiative side you're looking at on labor as well? Thank you. Eric Gehringer : Sure. It's a great question, Brian. So I'll start in the beginning there. To your point, coming out of the recovery, so the actual events that started the recovery. Yes, service performance, our velocity, and then looking at them now, strong moves in the right direction. As you properly said, we're not to where we need to be. As I look at that over the fourth quarter, our biggest opportunities are down in our Southern and specifically the Southeast region of our system. The teams absolutely focused on ensuring that we can continue to get those terminals operating at a historical dwell level or better.  And that's the focus right now. As we increase velocity, you see a direct correlation to our improvement in service and I expect that out of the team. Now, as far as the broader productivity, you hit on the fuel efficiency, and I want to take a minute to recognize the team on that and stress that because our Third Quarter best-ever record in a 1% improvement against a quarter that was dramatically challenging in a lot of different ways, specifically in how many trains we had to reroute, that's a massive accomplishment. But as you look at fuel efficiency, much like the rest of our pipelines, there's strong initiatives in each one of those.  So I think about, we still have the opportunity to modernize another 100 locomotives next year as part of our plan, that's on top of the 100 we're modernizing this year. And those modernizations will get locomotives that can be operating as DPU units, which provide fuel conservation as we can run more of those. As we think about EMS, I told you earlier in the year, we're going to install 800 units. We're installing 800 units this year and we'll continue with that investment next year. So I could continue to go on and on. The point is the pipelines are full. It has been a challenging quarter. There's nothing that stands in front of us to get back on track in Q4. Lance Fritz : Well, and Brian didn't ask it specifically. But you've got a path towards 10,000-foot average train length. Eric Gehringer : We with our September performance for the 9,500, we are absolutely on that path. And with the construction of our [indiscernible] that I mentioned, nine being already completed, 26 in the pipeline. We absolutely have that passive. Jennifer Hamann : And that's impacted by this modal supply chain issues. Eric Gehringer : For sure. Brian Ossenbeck : Right. Just a follow-up really quick, I was going to ask on that if the Train Link impact in the quarter really was from the bridge or would you see more volatility on that if the Intermodal Supply Chain doesn't recover as expected, or at least stabilize a bit? Eric Gehringer : Let's start with the bridge. So if you think about when the bridge went out, what that really did was it severed an artery where we were able to run trains longer than 8,300 feet. When we had to reroute the trains from Northern California over to Salt Lake and back up to Portland, we're restricted to that 8300 feet for a number of different reasons. So the fall-off and Train Link prior to September was absolutely related to the bridge outage. Now, to your point, as we see intermodal volumes grow, that's always a huge lever for us to grow Train Link, especially across our sunset corridor up to Chicago. Brian Ossenbeck : All right, great. Thank you for all the color I appreciate it. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Good morning. Eric, sticking with you. Maybe a bit of a quantitative follow-up to the last question and answers, the 150 million in reduced productivity expectations for this year is completely understandable given everything you've just laid out, whether it's macro or the bridge and the wildfires. Is that lost productivity though from the network as you think about a multiyear plan, or can you make that up at some point next year incrementally to what you were already budgeting for '22 productivity gains? Eric Gehringer : Yes, Jon, that's an exceptionally good question and I want to be very clear. That is not lost and it's expected that we make that up in next year. Jon Chappell : Okay. Great, and can it be within a six-month period or is it spread over the course of the year? Eric Gehringer : Now we're getting into those ending questions again. Jon, rest assured, the entire team understands we have to get that back. As you would imagine, as we think through the 2022 and what is going to present. Those plans are still under works, but it's all with an eye towards capturing back that $150 million. Jon Chappell : Okay. Great. Thanks, Eric. Eric Gehringer : Yup. Thank you, Jon. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS, please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I know you've had quite a few questions on capacity. But I guess wanted to get your thoughts on 2022 and how capacity and volume -- how we might think of that? I think there's positive thesis out there on rail that says, we've seen temporary weakness in volume, but you look to 2022 and there's pretty good chance volume improves. And I think that is probably linked to capacity coming online. Lance, do you think that's a reasonable view to have that UNP volume growth can accelerate nicely in 2022. And do you think you have good visibility to that capacity supporting that growth? Lance Fritz : Tom, thanks for the question. So absolutely it's a reasonable thesis to say we are going to grow in 2022. Our commitments that we made at Investor Day is over the three-year period, we're going to grow better than industrial production. And we believe that we're going to be able to do that. There is a couple of things that I'll point to. We've got Knight-Swift coming on board, that will be a growth engine, we've got the headwinds in the automotive industry and the overall supply chain mostly impacting the Intermodal business. In my viewpoint, it's very unlikely that carries all the way through next year, that there is capacity coming on for semiconductor manufacturing. The supply chain is going to have enough capacity to handle the throughput necessary. And so I think those get remedied and that's a growth engine. And then Kenny 's team, as we just outlined in bulk, industrial and in the premium side on business development, keep adding opportunity into the bucket, so it's absolutely a decent thesis to say we are growing and we're growing better than industrial production next year. Now, the other side of that is, capacity. We've got plenty of capacity. Our fixed capacity, our railroad can definitely handle the growth. as we go into next year. And we're poised to add the fungible resources that the employees necessary to handle it. Not on a one-for-one basis because we are generating productivity. but I see no issue with the thesis you just laid out. Tom Wadewitz : Can you talk a little bit about the specific resources you're adding? Are you adding more people at intermodal terminals, are you adding more chassis, are there areas you need to add more cars to support that in '22? Lance Fritz : There are always rifle shots from a capital spending perspective, Tom that we have to take care of. Eric identified some in terms of siding extensions. We've got some capacity spending that's going on in our new intermodal ramps, whether it's the Inland Empire or up in the Twin Cities. But I consider those rifle shots. Those are very specific little pieces of the network that we'll have a very positive generating ROI to them. In terms of manpower, resources, employees, we've got needs here and there.  And again, those tend to be pockets and they're driven by growth or they're driven by normal attrition. And we're right now in the process of hiring in a few areas around the network. We've got a training pipeline that's both representative of people we've hired and people we've called back from furlough. But I don't consider those numbers anything kind of worth commenting other than normal course of business. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Thanks, operator and good morning, guys. So Lance in getting I will kind of want to present the bear case and some of the arguments you are putting out there, right? I mean, we're in the tightest truck market, we've been in in sort of ever, right? This is a done conference game for Alabama as opposed to a college football playoff game, if you will. Now, and we're still seeing in modal volume down 6%. So when I get asked that question, how would you respond to the fact that in this really super tight market where demand for intermodal should be off the charts, you're not growing. So what's going to change between now and the next few years that will help you grow? Lance Fritz : Absolutely. David, you just outlined the connection. Our volume in intermodal is down because of tight dray market. We don't have enough dray capacity to support the overall supply chain on the intermodal product. That is going to be remedied, right? Lance Fritz : Supply and demand in our market economy gets remedied. Truck driver wages are going up, dray wages are going up. It's all looking good. So I feel very good about overcoming the bear case that you just outlined because they're intimately connected. David Vernon : First of all, I'm a Georgia fan and not Alabama. Lance Fritz : I took a shot. Kenny Rocker : First of all, yeah. We've got an investment here that's coming on in the first half of the year of chassis. We feel good about that. We've got ample container -- work on improve our competitiveness, here in the first half of the year. We've got GPS that we're investing in. I can't say enough about how much capacity opportunities are there in an Inland Empire. And we're working very closely what Eric's team on that. And we still have room to grow in the 2030. So yeah, there are some macroeconomic and supply chain challenges out there, but what you're hearing me say, and what you're hearing Lance say, is that boy as a team, we're really going after it and being very deliberate and specific about how to grow the business. David Vernon : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, is it right to think that the on-boarding of that night business will be easier because it's coming with the drayage and the chassis is and the stuff that Nate's going to bring along with it. Kenny Rocker : We don't see any issue bringing on that business. Lance Fritz : Yeah. We are committed. We're well-planned. There's a detailed executing plan already in place. And we're really looking forward to having them on as a partner there. They're running an outstanding business. They'll be a great partner to have. David Vernon : All right. Thanks a lot for the time guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, Miami One. If I can discuss being on the same team, Kenny, you highlighted in your prepared remarks some of the challenges forecasting the auto as business in the last few months. At the risk of asking you to judge somebody else's crystal ball, we have heard from some of the industry kind of data providers that their outlook for auto production recovery through 2022 is really slow. So is there a risk that an auto production is definitely going to ramp next year, but the ramp is not nearly as much as people think and be -- when the production does ramp, is there a risk that some of those finished products get put on truck to try and expedite their [indiscernible] dealers? Or are you quite fin about maintaining share in the RSS? Kenny Rocker : That's interesting question. It really depends on what you believe and what you've heard us say is that we believe the run rates will continue to move in the fourth quarter. And then it'll be up low, gradual ramp up in the first half by late spring, summer. We can get to where the forecast [indiscernible]. That be an excellent position for us. We expect to really have a strong product that is competitive with truck, but we don't see where we would lose any of that business. And we also would anticipate that some of the auto part business will show up a little bit before the finished vehicles product. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Ravi. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research, please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and congratulations in a tough quarter. Kenny, I'm going to stick with the football analogies here. When I go out, and I talk to shippers, they all tell me we'd love to use a lot more Intermodal than we're able to right now. In fact, if we had our druthers, we'd put another five or 6% of our spend and Intermodal. How many points are we'll leave it on the Board due to these turnovers, so to speak, from the environment? And if you were able to get that great capacity and run the network the way you'd like to, what do you think Intermodal would look like now? Kenny Rocker : That's also an interesting question. What I'll tell you what we're doing is going out and inserting solutions where we can. So Eric and his team has done a really good job with keeping in contact with the terminals from a technology side, we've been surrogate APIs at the Port from an investment perspective. We're going out and really owning our own destiny in terms of expansion. We're creating solutions for our customers. Clearly, Eric talked about what we've done in our G3 facility.  We also opened up temporarily another facility down in the Houston area our loops subsidiary is going out and working with the BCO, expedite drayage. We're pulling everything we can in our control to not just accept what the supply chain challenges are out there. We're trying to own it. And so you've heard about the investments that we're making on the chassis and GPS side. So what you're hearing from me is we're doing everything we can to control our destiny, to maximize. Lance Fritz : Kenny, another way to answer Jeff's question, Jeff, if you recall when we came into the year, we had a guidance that said 4 to 6% growth. And coming out of the second quarter, the lay of the land look ed pretty strong and we up that to 7%. And now because in part of the Intermodal Supply chain disruptions, along with the continued issues on semiconductors for automotive, we've dropped that back to 5%. So right there you see 2% points of growth on the whole business that is connected to supply chains being screwed up. Jeff Kauffman : Could I go a little further out on that, though. I guess what I'm reaching for here is, I understand the current environment. But you're doing about, let's call it $4.5 billion in intermodal revenue. We got a truck industry that's capacity constrained. We got prices going through the roofs. We got a lot of people that want to use intermodal but just can't right now, for a variety of reasons or not as much as they want to right now. If these factors were to mitigate over the next two years. Three years, what do you think that Intermodal business could look like? I mean, do your customers say, geez, we'd love to give you another 5% of our transportation budget on intermodal it's the network can handle it. I mean, what kind of conversations you have with folk\u2019s kind of beyond the short-term fix? Lance Fritz : Hey, Jeff, this is Lance, your thesis is spot on. Our customers tell us that they'd love to use more intermodal product. And that's a great place to be. We're not going to try to guess exactly what that looks like. We'll build next year's budget. We've got a long-range plan we'll continue to tweak and build on. But your thesis is spot on. There are tons of opportunity out there. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Hi, just a quick question on coal. I know the domestic opportunity should be good for EP with gas prices, but I think Kenny, you mentioned export too. I didn't think that was as big or important part of your franchise, I'm curious how much of an opportunity export can be? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Every carload matters and we've been able to grow our export business. But to your point, it's a smaller part of our overall portfolio. Jordan Alliger : But there is opportunity set there and in this environment? Kenny Rocker : Absolutely. We've seen a handful of wins that we're really excited about. Lance Fritz : Putting a little bow on that Jordan, you know the eastern railroads, and their export business is substantial and big and our export business doesn't really look anything like that. Jordan Alliger : Got it. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. A - Lance Fritz : Well, thank you, Rob. And thank you all for being engaged with us this morning and your questions. We really appreciate getting into those discussions. We look forward to talking with you again in January when we discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. And until then, I wish you all a very good health. Thank you. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. As we wrap-up 2021, I want to start with a thank you to the Union Pacific team. This past year has been anything but easy as we dealt with massive weather events, wildfires, supply chain congestion, and continued impacts from the pandemic. Through all of those challenges, our employees did the hard work necessary to deliver a record financial year. I am so grateful for our team's strength and their determination. They give me confidence that our best days truly lie ahead. Turning to our fourth quarter results, this morning Union Pacific is reporting 2021 fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share. This compares to adjusted fourth quarter 2020 results of $1.6 billion or $2.36 per share. You'll note that 2020 reported results included an impairment charge related to our Brazos Yard investment. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 57.4% deteriorated 180 basis points versus 2020's adjusted OR largely driven by the headwind from fuel prices. For the full year, we achieved a record 57.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2020 adjusted results, and as Jennifer will lay out in a few minutes, we're on track to achieve a full year operating ratio that starts with a 55 in 2022. Even with the challenges of the past year, we set fourth quarter and full year records for operating income and net income. A comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the achievements of the team over the past two years. As you'll hear in greater detail from Eric, our fourth quarter safety and service performance did not meet expectations. I am pleased, however, that as we exit the year, our network is healing. Reflecting back, 2021 was a difficult year in many ways, but through our commitment to PSR and delivering for our customers, we navigated each obstacle and are now better for having dealt with them. During 2021, we took significant steps to advance our ESG efforts, capped off by the release of our initial Climate Action Plan in December. This plan lays out a framework to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and includes a commitment to net zero by 2050, and we are the only U.S. railroad to do so. One element of our plan is to reduce overall fuel consumption, and we made continued progress last year. Our full year fuel consumption rate improved 1% for a new record low. This represents the third consecutive year we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, and it helped our customers eliminate 22.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck. So, let's get started with Kenny for an update on the business environment. Kenyatta Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was down 4% compared to a year ago. Gains in our Industrial and Bulk segments were more than offset by declines in our Premium business group from continued global supply chain disruptions. However, Freight revenue was up 10% driven by higher fuel surcharges, positive mix, and strong pricing gains. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to 2020 driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges, positive mix, and strong core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 13% year-over-year. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices. The sequential decline was due in part to softer demand from milder weather in the fourth quarter. The harvest for grain and grain products drove the 15% sequential improvement. However, shipments were down 1% compared to 2020 due to reduced grain export shipments to the Gulf. Weaker grain shipments were partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 9% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased export potash shipments. Moving on to Industrial, Industrial revenue was improved by 14% for the quarter driven by an 8% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were flat compared to 2020. Higher demand for LPG and soda ash was offset by fewer project-related waste shipments and petroleum products. Volume for forest products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by demand for brown paper used in corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business plans. Metals and minerals volumes continue to be a bright spot. Volume was up 18% compared to 2020 primarily driven by our business development efforts along with strong steel demand. In addition, demand recovery for construction materials and favorable comps for frac sand contributed to strong year-over-year growth. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 1% on a 14% decrease in volume versus 2020. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains, and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was down 10% in the quarter due to semiconductor-related part shortages and associated plant shutdowns. However, sequentially we saw a 10% increase versus the third quarter due to improved semiconductor availability. Intermodal volume was down 15% driven by continued international intermodal supply chain disruptions impacting the quarter as ocean carriers and BTO shifted more freight port to port. Sequentially, intermodal volume was down 10% versus the third quarter, as global supply chains remain challenged. Now, looking ahead to 2022, here are the economic indicators that correlate closely with our business. You see that Industrial production is currently forecasted to grow at 4.8% in 2022. We also recognize that we will face continued challenges in our energy-related markets, but despite those hurdles we continue to build upon our solid strategy to serve, grow, win, together. This strategy enables us to outperform the markets with our reliable service and continued focus on enhancing the customer experience. So as we begin 2022, I'm excited and bullish for the opportunities we have in front of us. For our Bulk commodities, we are optimistic about the growth in most of our markets due to favorable market conditions and business development wins. For fertilizer, we anticipate incremental growth with strong market demand and the long term deal with Canpotex where we have expanded terminal capacity to handle more volume with longer trains. Coal should see year-over-year growth based on the expectations of continued favorable natural gas prices. Additionally, plant retirements forecasted in 2022 will be offset by two new contract wins that started on January 1. For grain, we have tough comps versus 2021 as exports have been strong for the last couple of years. However, in grain products we are leading the market in biofuels development by securing opportunities on both sides of the house, the inbound feedstocks and the outbound finished biofuels. Moving to our Industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets like metal. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our Industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. However, as we move through the year, we expect lumber shipments to be adversely impacted by the current forecast for housing starts. And lastly, for Premium, we expect strong uplift for both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 15 million units in 2021 to 15.4 million in 2022 due to the vehicle inventory re-stocking effort. Plus, wins to convert finished vehicles and auto parts shipments from over-the-road will further strengthen UP's automotive business. Domestic intermodal will benefit from retail inventory re-stocking, continued strength in retail sales, and tight truck supply. We're seeing slow improvement on our international volumes, but we also remain cognizant of the continued labor shortages that are impacting the global supply chain. Setting aside those forces outside of our control, we continue to create our own opportunities to grow. We are focused on expanding our reach into new markets in the industry. We're growing our footprint in the Twin Cities and Inland Empire Intermodal Terminal. This quarter we will also have a new product offering with our ag transload site at Global IV, and a nice swift business win that started this month positions us for robust growth in 2022. But just to be clear, we're not only investing on the intermodal side. We're making significant investment to support growth on the car load side, too. We've recently purchased two transload sites in strong economic growth areas like the Inland Empire and Phoenix. As we forge ahead with our aggressive commercial strategy, we're accelerating growth beyond this year. The future looks bright heading into 2023 as we just announced that UP will be the primary intermodal rail carrier in the West for Schneider. This new business will start up in January 2023. I'm proud of our commercial team. They are intensely focused on working with our customers to find creative solutions to win in the marketplace. We are anxious to build upon this momentum and grow with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. 2021 proved to be a challenging year operationally as we saw a wide range of events impact the network from wildfires to supply chain congestion. The team leveraged their collective strength to find solutions to keep trains moving. We exited the year in a more fluid state recognizing additional improvement is still imperative. Taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on slide 10, compared to fourth quarter 2020, our operating metrics deteriorated, although we improved most of our metrics sequentially from third quarter. Freight car velocity was impacted by reduced crew availability due to an increase in COVID infections and providing time off for vaccinations. Through reducing our re-crew rate, recalling remaining furloughed employees, streamlining processes to on-board crews, and increasing crew vaccination rates, our crew availability improved throughout the quarter. Our intermodal trip plan compliance of 78% is a decline from last year, however is a 12 point sequential improvement from third quarter results. This sequential improvement is evidence that our intermodal assets are balanced and we are poised for growth. Our manifest in auto trip plan compliance results of 58% represented a decline both year-over-year and sequentially. Crew availability had a greater impact on our manifest network. The December manifest and auto trip plan compliance results of 62% indicate we are trending in a positive direction, and we are building on these gains to start the year. Efforts during the quarter focused on the Southeastern portion of our network, and we successfully returned manifest operations to a fluid state. Our bulk operations, however, are not currently to a level that meets expectations. We are focused on driving improvement to this network as we did to the manifest network. Turning to slide 11, our efficiency metrics remain strong in the quarter, although some results were muted by the crew availability and lower volumes. Locomotive productivity declined 9% compared to fourth quarter 2020 due to higher locomotive resources to assist with recovery efforts in the southeastern portion of the network. Fourth quarter record workforce productivity improved 1% to 1,046 daily miles per FTE. Recognizing the importance of balancing strong crew utilization and planning for the future, we are focused on effectively managing crew levels. We're in the marketplace hiring, although we have been challenged in certain locations. Working with our partners and workforce resources to expand our reach, we are developing creative programs and campaigns like our Second Chance program to attract new employees to Union Pacific. Train length increased 2% from a year ago to over 9,300 feet enabled by the completion of 15 sightings during the year. Although our ability to grow train length in the fourth quarter was impeded by lower volumes in the intermodal business, we did deliver train length improvement in other business lines, including a 4% improvement in our manifest train length. Utilizing the strong foundation built with the adoption of PSR, the team is ready to handle the expected growth in this and future years. Turning to slide 12, with respect to our capital spending, PSR allows us to efficiently operate the railroad in a less capital-intensive manner. We continue to exercise discipline while still delivering value to our shareholders. Capital spending will remain in line with our long term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. For 2022, we are targeting capital spending of $3.3 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. The increase in capital spending is driven by targeted freight car acquisitions, investments in growth-related capital projects to drive more carloads to the network, and finally, slightly higher material and labor inflation cost. Approximately 80% of our planned capital spending will go towards replacement of our existing infrastructure. This spending will renew older assets, harden our infrastructure, and allow us to continue to operate safely. We are continuing to support intermodal volume growth starting with investments in certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers including the Schneider business win that Kenny highlighted. We are also expanding the Twin Cities from a pop-up to a full-scale intermodal terminal and adding additional capacity to the Inland Empire pop-up intermodal terminal. Finally, we will wrap up the multiyear project to install wide span Gantry cranes at our G4 intermodal terminal in Chicago, bringing additional capacity to a key intermodal market. We will also continue modernizing our locomotive fleet by upgrading approximately 120 older assets. These modernizations not only improve the reliability of the asset, but each unit is a 5% more fuel efficient and emits approximately 53% less carbon emissions. Lastly, we will continue to invest in capacity projects that drive productivity and improve our network efficiency. We plan to complete approximately 20 sightings this year focused in the southern portion of our network to further support our train length initiative. Wrapping up on slide 13, entering 2022 we are enhancing our safety programs. We've engaged an external safety partner to focus on advanced risk identification and mitigation, coupled with enriched behavioral safety programs. Our goal is to be the first railroad to reach world-class safety performance, as there is nothing more important than making sure every employee returns home safely. With the robust market demand and strong volume outlook Kenny described, I have complete confidence that the operating team will be able to safely meet the growth needs of our customers. The operating team is focused on continuous performance improvement of the railroad to drive customer-centric growth while remaining judicious in our allocation of resources. While 2021 did not always bring optimal operating conditions, by working together and remaining agile, we entered each challenge and laid a foundation for continued success this year and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting off with the income statement on slide 15; whereas Lance mentioned earlier we've adjusted 2020 results to exclude the Brazos impairment charge, throughout my remarks today I will be comparing 2021 to 2020 adjusted results. Operating revenue in the quarter totalled $5.7 billion, up 12% versus 2020 despite a 4% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 15% to $3.3 billion. I'll provide more detail in a moment, but excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Together, we are reporting record fourth quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase versus 2020. Other income of $83 million is up 26% driven by a $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense was up 6% as increased average debt levels were partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Net income of $1.7 billion increased 8% which, when combined with our strong share repurchase program, led to a 13% increase in earnings per share to $2.66. Our 57.4% fourth quarter operating ratio increased 180 basis points, reflecting 100 basis point negative impact of higher fuel prices as well as reduced operational efficiency. As we did throughout 2021, we're also comparing our results to 2019. Against that fourth quarter comparison, we generated 16% higher operating income on 1% less volume, clearly demonstrating that ongoing price discipline and operational efficiency we've achieved over the past two years. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our Freight revenue, which totals $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 10% compared to 2020. Volume was down 400 basis points driven by the factors Kenny described earlier. Positive business mix coupled with a strong pricing actions that yielded dollars exceeding our inflation drove 725 basis points in total improvement. Lower intermodal volume combined with higher Industrial shipments drove the positive mix. Fuel surcharge revenue of $522 million increased Freight revenue 700 basis points as our fuel surcharge programs continued to chase rising fuel prices. Now let's move on to slide 17 which provides a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. As I just mentioned, the primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 80% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. Our fuel consumption rate was flat compared to 2020 as a favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 5% versus 2020. Fourth quarter workforce levels increased 1% as flat management, engineering, and mechanical workforces were offset by 3% growth in our train and engine crews. This increase reflects our actions to recall furloughed employees as well as bring on new hires to manage utilization challenges and, importantly, in preparation for growth. Costs per employee increased 4% as a result of wage inflation, as well was higher recrew, overtime, and borrow-out costs partially offset by last year's $37 million employee COVID bonus. Purchase services and materials expense was up 9%, in part due to the comparison to favorable inner line settlements in 2020 as well as increased locomotive maintenance, crew van usage, and purchase transportation. Equipment and other rents was up 5% driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 29% in the quarter driven by higher personal injury expense associated primarily with two adverse outcomes as well as increased freight loss and damage and state and local taxes. As we look to 2022, overall workforce levels are expected to increase with volume although not one for one as we continued to drive productivity. Costs per employee in 2022 should increase in the low-single digits as productivity partially offsets inflation. Depreciation expense will be up around 2% versus 2021 while we expect the other expense line to be relatively flat year-over-year. Purchase services and materials expense is a bit more of a wild card but will be impacted by inflationary pressure as well as the expected recovery in auto volumes. Finally, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Looking now at our efficiency results on slide 18, we took a step back in the quarter and did not meet our original or revised productivity targets, finishing the year with $195 million of net productivity. Higher casualty expenses, increased costs associated with network operations, and reduced volume leverage cumulatively drove the productivity loss. For the full year, we achieved improvements in all areas, led by locomotive and workforce productivity initiatives. These gains were partially offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds in 2021. While these results are clearly not what we expect of ourselves, we view the productivity as deferred, not lost. Similarly, fourth quarter incremental margins were muted at 27%. For the full year, our 77% incremental margins are more indicative of our capabilities, particularly given the positive business mix in 2021. The ability to efficiently add volume to our network is the foundation for delivering strong shareholder value going forward. Moving to slide 19, we'll review full year 2021 with earnings per share of $9.95, a 21% increase versus adjusted 2020 results. Revenue was up 12% on 4% volume growth, increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains, and a positive business mix. Record operating income increased 15% to $9.3 billion. Even with a 140 basis point headwind from rising fuel prices, our full year operating ratio of 57.2% improved 130 basis points versus adjusted 2020. Our improvement in 2021 marks the fifth consecutive year of operating ratio gains for Union Pacific, demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency even during a difficult year, and a further comparison of our results to 2019 shows that the hurdles of the past two years has not slowed our momentum. Turning now to cash and returns on slide 20, full year cash from operations increased approximately $500 million to $9 billion, a 6% increase from 2020. The first priority for our cash is our capital investment which finished 2021 just over $3 billion or roughly 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 93%, and free cash flow after dividends increased $285 million or 9% compared to 2020. Our dividend payout ratio for 2021 was 43%, in line with our 45% target, as we rewarded shareholders with two 10% dividend increases during the year, distributing a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders. We also returned cash to our owners through strong share repurchases, buying back a total of 33 million common shares or 3% at an all-in cost of $7.3 billion, which includes $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $10.1 billion to our owners in 2021, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. Now, looking at the strength of our balance sheet on slide 21, we finished the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings. At year-end, our Moody's rating was Baa1 and A minus from both S&P and Fitch. Our all-in adjusted debt balance on December 31 of $31 billion increased over $2 billion from year-end 2020 as we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet and earnings growth to reward shareholders. Finally, our return on invested capital came in at a record 16.4%, bouncing back more than 2 points from a challenging 2020 and increased 1.4 points from 2019. The reduced capital intensity associated with running a PSR operation is seen clearly in this performance and positions us for growth in the years ahead. So wrapping up with a look to 2022 on slide 22, let me start by pointing you back to our May Investor Day and the three-year targets we laid out. Those targets remain intact and are the building blocks of our view to 2022. With volumes we stated, we would outpace Industrial production through our business development efforts which are going strong, as Kenny mentioned. The current forecast for 2022 Industrial production is 4.8%. To outperform that forecast, we have new business wins like Knight-Swift as well as anticipated recovery of autos and international. We also expect to have the added benefit of coal volume growth. As you'll recall, we originally anticipated coal to be a half-point headwind over the next three years, but with current natural gas prices and recent business wins, that business should actually provide a tailwind in 2022. Looking at the cadence of volumes through the year, the first half should be led by Bulk and Industrial. In the second half, we'd look for stronger year-over-year gains and for it to be more Premium-driven as supply chains and chip shortages improve. For first quarter volumes specifically, we're anticipating carloads will track below full year 2022 growth expectations as we experience a muted post-holiday rebound likely impacted by rising COVID infection rates plus continued soft international intermodal volumes. With a strong overall demand environment and our disciplined pricing approach, we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all-in inflation for the year will be elevated a little north of 3%. At our Investor Day, we targeted incremental margins in the mid to upper-60% range. For 2022, we would expect to be at the low end of that range given the significant mix shift to intermodal growth. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation, and strong incremental margins should lead to the achievement of our long term goal of a 55% operating ratio. Putting a little finer point to it, we would expect to achieve around a 55.5% operating ratio for full year 2022. Turning to cash and capital, you heard our plan to invest around $3.3 billion of capital for the year, well within our long term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Strong top line growth, increasing profitability, and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate near 100%. This strong cash generation allows us to continue rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases which we expect will be in line with 2021 levels. Before I turn it back to Lance to wrap up, I'd like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. What they achieved over the past year is truly remarkable. Union Pacific success begins and ends with our people. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. Wrapping up on slide 24 with a look at our drivers for success in 2022, as you heard from Eric, it's imperative that we make progress on safety. While there are positive signs in the underlying metrics, the overall results need to improve. Safety is at the center of everything we do at Union Pacific as we strive toward our goal of world-class performance. Overall, the network's improving but with work to be done. We have work streams aimed at keeping a healthy pipeline of crews in place, and we're in the marketplace hiring for growth. In addition, we have numerous initiatives to improve the quality of our service. Our long term growth opportunities are dependent on a reliable service product. As you heard from Kenny, our growth outlook for 2022 is terrific. The growth mentality we're instilling on the entire team is manifesting itself in new customer wins while we continue to build stronger books with our long term partners. We have an opportunity to offer enhanced customer experience and new transportation solutions for our customers while helping them achieve their sustainability goals. 2021 represented another milestone in our company's history, and 2022's poised to be even better. We'll be celebrating our 160th anniversary with what we expect to be our best financial year ever and take further steps on ESG journey. We have great momentum as we strive for operational excellence, grow with our customers, and as we win together with all of our stakeholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys. Maybe we can start on the volume outlook and I think the expectation to grow above industry all production. I guess, Jennifer, you talked a little bit about the cadence maybe being a little bit softer in the first half and accelerating into the second half. I guess maybe a couple questions here. First, first quarter, do you think you can end up having volumes up in the quarter? And then in terms of some of the business wins and the other opportunities out there, do you think that there is enough to be able to see that acceleration? I think over the last couple of quarters we've been a little bit disappointed in general across the rail industry of the ability to grow volume at a more accelerated pace. Just want to get a little more color on sort of how you think about the building blocks to get to that 4.8 or better for the full year. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. I'll start and then turn it over to Kenny, but you're thinking of it right, Chris. And we do expect our volumes to grow in the first quarter. But again, we see it kind of -- and you laid it out, first half, second half. First half is going to be led by Bulk and Industrial. We certainly embedded in the expectation for stronger growth in the second half is the recovery in the supply chains, and that includes the chip shortages. So that is our expectation for the year, and we feel very bullish about that. And I'll let Kenny talk to you about that a little bit more. Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah, Chris. We're seeing -- and this is pretty slow here. We're seeing slow marginal growth from where we were in the fourth quarter to now on our international intermodal volumes. So we're looking at that every day. I'll tell you that. Same is true about the automotive business. And I talked about the fact that sequentially from third to fourth quarter, we saw that 10% improvement. We're expecting that to increase, and that's what you're seeing in the back half of the year. We also feel good about a couple business wins on the coal side that'll help us from a car load perspective. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Yes. Hey. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time, wanted to focus a little bit on the outlook and the supply chain congestion. What happens if the congestion doesn't recover as quickly as possible? Where should we see some of the impacts? And sort of what markers are you looking for on the supply chain as you go to adjust the outlook potentially and move throughout the year? Lance Fritz : Yeah, Jason. This is Lance. We've built the 2022 plan not on perfection. So we've kind of built into the plan an expectation that, for instance, in the international intermodal supply chain, there's slow but steady recovery. Some of the mark Justin Long with Stephens ers that we're looking at that need to recover to be back to normal and fluid still involve street time for things like chassis and boxes. Our intermodal ramps are fluid right now. They're in great shape. We need to see our international intermodal customers go back to more IPI business. That is allowing the international box to go inland and then turn back around preferably with an export. I'll turn it over to Kenny and Eric for a little more detail. Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah, Lance. You hit it right on the head. We're talking to our customers daily about that conversion from port to port. The inland ramps that we have, we have seen that, that is slowly occurring. Now, remember, we've got a backlog of ships out there on the water, so that's got to get sorted out. The same thing we're going to be keeping an eye on is at a lot of these inland ramps how the warehouses are doing and are they able to process a lot of that business that's coming on. So it's going to be a slow, gradual increase to us, but we're talking to our customers. And we expect more improvement as we go throughout the year. Eric Gehringer : Just reflect on this year and what happened with Premium volumes in the second half of the year. They were softer, and so we're certainly looking for that to be stronger in the back half of 2022. Jason Seidl : I've got my fingers crossed for you guys. My follow-up is going to be on pricing. You mentioned, Jennifer, I think you're going to be above inflation, which you're putting around 3%. Talk to me a little bit about the contracts that you're repricing now. And sort of how well above your cost inflation are the new contracts versus your base business? Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. I'll take that, Jennifer. We've got a favorable pricing environment. I'm going to talk about, call it, our domestic intermodal business. We're about 10%, 15% in on a lot of the bids that we're looking at. And again, it's a favorable pricing environment. We'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year. Right now it looks good, but we're going to be looking at it quarter by quarter. But great environment to be repricing. Jennifer Hamann : Clarification there, Kenny. When you said we're 10% or 15% in, you're talking about the total number of bids? Kenyatta Rocker : Total number of bids that we're looking at. Jennifer Hamann : Then just to clarify -- and, Jason, I know you know this -- but when we talk about pricing above inflation, it's in dollars. So we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of our inflation dollars. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kenny, wanted to ask about some of these new business wins in intermodal, which is obviously a credit to you and the whole team. I know this has been a focus for you guys for a while now. These new IMCs that are coming online obviously have assets behind them, and I'm just trying to understand if that represents a mix-up opportunity for the company within intermodal. And obviously you participate in pools, and as a result I think you guys have a higher degree of asset-like channel partners than your direct competitor. So if you could just talk about the mix within intermodal as this new business comes online over the next couple-years this year and next year? Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. First of all, before I get to the new players, we feel really good about our long term partner, and we look at them as an industry leader. Clearly, we're bringing on Knight-Swift this year. They are a strong industry leader. And then in the future, we'll bring on Schneider. We look at that as a great value to the BCO. We believe that that's going to give us and them a lot of optionality to grow. Clearly, that's the impetus there to offer more options. It's going to also give Eric an opportunity to densify a lot of networks and execute on a lot of intermodal excellence initiatives that he has. As we look at our own IMCs that we have out there and our own equipment, you know that we're doubling down on investing there. So we invested in almost 6,000 chassis. We're bringing on GPS. So we feel like we've got a great mixture to offer those private asset players that are on our network and also the ones that will be utilizing our equipment. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. And then just for my follow-up, Jennifer, you haven't got a incremental margin or OR question yet, so I know you're waiting for that. I wanted to circle back on the 55.5% OR guidance for this year. I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes there. Because on one hand you've got a great pricing opportunity ahead of you. It's showing up in the yield, and I would assume moreso over the course of 2022. But you also have some of these large new business wins on the intermodal side which has less revenue intensity attached to it. So I am just trying to understand if you could talk about some of the puts and takes that underlie the margin guidance for 2022 in which you kind of characterized it as conservative given the pricing opportunity. Or is it kind of well balanced between pricing and mix as you see the year playing out? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah, Amit. Thanks for that. And I knew I could count on you for the margin question. But we feel very bullish about our opportunities in 2022 and feel very good about being able to hit that long-established operating ratio target of the 55%. And 55.5% obviously is right smack dab in the middle of that fairway. There will be cost pressures. We know that. Higher inflationary environment. We know that we need to bring on some more employees, and so you're going to see our headcount go up a little bit. Not at a one-for-one with volume, but we will be bringing on new employees. So there's hiring and training costs and then just running the network more fluidly which we're off to a great start here as we come into 2022. So feel good about it. I'm not going to give a characterization one way or the other, but we're very excited about the long term potential, and 2022 is just going to be another building block on that progression as we become more and more profitable and provide a better service product to more and more customers. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Great. Good morning. Great job on the quarter. Kenny, you noted some significant wins here, two coal plant wins. You won Knight and Schneider's business. Do we normally see a tipping point of Burlington Northern chasing to win back business when it gets out of flack? I think back to the middle of the 2000s when there were coal contracts that they would always go back and forth. So I just want to understand what kind of competitive marks that you have when you have consistent sizable wins that we should expect. Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. Thanks for that, Ken. Good to hear from you. So pointing back to May, that Investor Day, we set out our targets, and we want to execute on those targets first of all. At the end of the day, truck is our true competition, and so we're exhausting all efforts to go out and win against truck. Now we've talked quite a bit about that intermodal piece. We're doing the same thing on the car load side. There's still a lot of opportunity there. So we view the competition as truck, and we're going to be pretty dogged. The team is all over this about trying to convert as much truck business as we can. Lance Fritz : Yeah, Kenny. What I'm really excited about 2022 and beyond isn't the one-time conversion of business from somebody else to us. It's the fact that those businesses are very well run, and our existing long term partner is exceptionally well run in Hub, and they're growth engines in and of themselves for years to come. That's what really turns me on. Ken Hoexter : So just a quick follow-up. Kenny, you mentioned you're seeing some slowing domestic movement. I just want to understand if you can clarify what you were talking about within that. And then, Lance, any thoughts? I mean, obviously a lot of press on security on the yard. Is this something that's just more press? Is it something you're getting increasingly concerned about, given your boxes are sitting on storage? Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. Let me start on the security side, and then Kenny will turn it back over to you. So, there's been a lot of coverage about some thefts that are occurring in the LA basin specifically. That is a -- I'll call that a relatively unique situation where something that used to be a nuisance, call it, two years ago, members in a neighborhood would see a train not moving and might take advantage of trying to pop open a box and see what's inside. Today that's more organized, and we have our arms around it. We've increased our own police presence. We're working with the LAPD in that area. We're working with the State, whose also getting involved. We're actively working to get the district attorney in the area spooled up and interested prosecuting the cases. So I think at this point we've got our arms around it. We've cleaned up the area, and we're going to be enhancing security in the area, to your point. We're going to put physical security barriers in place. It's unfortunate because they won't be necessarily pretty, but it will protect our property. And more importantly, it'll protect our employees. That's probably the biggest concern I've had throughout this whole time frame. We hate impacting our customers. We really can't stomach putting our employees at risk. Lance Fritz : Yeah. On the international intermodal side again, we're seeing a slow uptick as those units come on to our network. On the domestic intermodal side, we typically see a little bit of a, I'll call it, lull, pause after the Christmas break. We saw it last year, and it happened a little bit later because of the parcel. Nothing that's concerning us. You heard in my comments around the business that we're competing for early on and the price environment there. So fundamentally, we still feel optimistic about domestic intermodal. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one more on the inter-modal for you, Kenny. We talked about this port-to-port for a little while now. What's the driver behind that? And I guess what gets that unstuck and back to your network? Is that why you feel you need to add a little bit more transload? It just seems like the economics are pretty good for the liners to make the quick turns, and that might be a headwind here on your international intermodal for a little while. I guess just to get my other follow-up maybe for Eric, can you just talk about what's left to improve on the network? You mentioned some of the challenges in the Southeast and a little bit of improvements, but still Bulk needs to get back on track. What are the few factors you're looking to put in place there? And how far are you along in permitting those right now? Lance Fritz : Kenny, that first question was about port-to-port. Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. I talked about it a little bit. We are seeing more customers each week that are turning on more business to go inland to the ramp. That's going to take a while. I talked about the fact that we've got a lot of shift still out on the water. It's encouraging to see that both they're talking about doing it, but we're also seeing it show up in our carloads. We're looking at that on a week-to-week basis. Eric's ramps are clean. We've got the equipment. We've got the capacity. We're prepared for it. So we want our customers to bring it on. Lance Fritz : You got good match-back programs, too. That takes some of the expense of moving an empty container back West and turning it into a revenue stream. Eric Gehringer : We're excited about the ag program that we have at Global IV coming on, and we've seen uplift from Dallas, Dallas to dock. So a number of products that are out there that are going to be of value to those international customers. Kenyatta Rocker : Then, Brian, on your question around career availability, you mentioned the Southeastern portion of the railroad. That's exactly right. When we walked into the quarter, that was one of the challenges that lied ahead of us was to be able to recover the manifest network in the southeast portion. From my comments, we've done that. We've brought back the fluidity that we expect, which reduces the stress in our crew base. Now as I think about it as a whole system though and you think about crew availability, really got three components to that. The first one is COVID, and as we think about COVID, it's not just people who unfortunately are at home because they are either positive or they have been quarantined but also people who have to be vaccinated. And if you think about the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year, the fourth quarter was significantly more impactful to us in that way than earlier in the year. The next part is the utilization of our crew base, and as I look back over the third quarter and coming into the fourth quarter, completing the fourth quarter, we've reduced our re-crew rate by one-third. And that's incredibly important because that provides us flexibility in our crew base to continue to meet growth demands. Then finally as I talked a little bit about, the other part of crew availability is ensuring that we're out in the marketplace hiring for attrition and for growth. And as you heard Jennifer mention, we're not hiring one-for-one. We're hiring for that growth. It's a challenging market in certain geographic locations, but what we have is a workforce resource department that has certainly stretched themselves into all sorts of different campaigns and initiatives to help us continue to hire to our demand. And I'm very encouraged for it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Chappell : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric, sticking with you, it sounds like a lot of the issues with the KPIs and the productivity are somewhat anomalous. These labor availability things are hopefully very temporary and more related to short term sickness and structural and hopes that the supply chain eases as well. When we spoke in October, you were very optimistic that the deferred productivity gains from 2021 would fall into 2022 in addition to what you'd already had planned for 2022. As you think about it now, given a still kind of challenging port, are you confident you can get all of the deferrals into 2022? And is that early 2022 or late 2022? Or does some of the plan for 2022 slip into 2023 as well? Eric Gehringer : John, thanks for that question. It's an excellent question, and I want to be really clear. I believe all of it is just deferred. I believe we've set ourselves up coming out of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 to be able to capitalize on exactly what we said. And to your point, some of those events that impact us were transitory. Some of them, like COVID, we may still see that impact. Here is a team that's committed to being able to capture that deferred, and that's exactly what we're poised to do in 2022. John Chappell : Does it slip at all, maybe first half versus second half, what you thought in October, because of the Omicron variant that's made things a little bit more choppy? Eric Gehringer : I think if my crystal ball was that clear I'd tell you that, but probably like you, John, we have to go through and plan for those contingencies. If the impact comes down, we've got to make sure we're ready to capitalize on the potential from our productivity. If the impact of COVID goes up, you'll see us flex to that as best as we possibly can. Our goal is first to ensure that our employees are safe, and they are taking the time off if they are positive, followed by making sure when they are here, collectively we're being as productive as we possibly can while we're also being excessively safe. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Kenny, when I take the contract wins with Knight and Coal, and I don't know if Canpotex is new or not, how much volume from those contracts is there? Is that a point of volume? Two points of volume? Any color there? And then, Jennifer, any just any thoughts on mix for the year? I'm guessing based on your volume comments positive first half but negative second half, but would you think full year mix is positive-negative based on the volume outlook? Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Unfortunately, I'm not going to size the volume for you. I can tell you that we're excited about it, and Eric is prepared to handle that business. And we think that there is long term strategic value in having Hub and Knight-Swift on our line this year. And then eventually long term we'll be able to provide our BCO with a lot of options. And it gives us the opportunity to really build up our network and go after that truck business. So we're pretty excited about it. Jennifer Hamann : Bottom line, it fundamentally supports the guidance we gave at the Investor Day in May which is something like 3% growth for averaging for the next three years, above industry all production. So you're well positioned to be able to deliver that. Kenyatta Rocker : And now that number is like 4.8%. Jennifer Hamann : We knew that, again, continuing to come out of the pandemic, you were going to have stronger Industrial production in the earlier part of that three-year range. So the business wins and just Kenny's team going out and hustling is what gives us that upside to Industrial production. To your mix question, Scott, I do believe based on our expectations, particularly with the Premium business being stronger in the second half that we will have on a full year basis a mix headwind. But I think you're looking at it correctly when I look at the drivers for growth in the first half being more Industrial and Bulk-loaded. It should look a little different in the first half than the full year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So there's been some renewed commentary at the federal level about whether fairly or not kind of pointing the finger a little bit at the rails and shipping companies for kind of the lack of competition there kind of being drivers of the congestion and inflation and everything else. Kind of irrespective of whether that's true or not, can you just share what are your conversations with the STB like nowadays? Do you see any progress towards switching possible? Or where do you think the outcome of that perception might be? And just a follow-up. Jennifer, thanks for the detail on the driver of 2022 volume growth between end-markets. I'm not sure you mentioned domestic intermodal as one of the drivers of the upside to Industrial production growth. So just to tie up all of the intermodal commentary on the call so far, do you expect domestic intermodal to see a snap-back? And if when congestion eases and the truck market continues to get tighter? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : I'll do the clean-up first. Then you can talk on the regulatory side, Lance. I did reference the Knight-Swift business. When that's domestic intermodal, that's part of what's driving the plus for us relative to Industrial production. And then just when you look at again some of the supply chain issues which impacted both international and domestic being intermodal, as we see those resolving themselves more in the back half of the year, we would look to see strong performance there. Lance Fritz : Yeah. And, Ravi, in regards to our conversation with the STB, notwithstanding whatever perception is held at a federal level regarding our participation in the current supply chain congestion, factually, we are open and ready for business. We talked openly on this call about some of the operating challenges we faced in the fourth quarter. Exiting the year, we're on better footing, and you will see that better footing demonstrated in our public numbers. You've already seen some of that at the very beginning of the year, and that continues to improve. In terms of the regulatory environment, we are actively engaged with the STB. The workload from our perspective is probably in this order. There's the CP KCS transaction that we need to be engaged in. We've got a fundamental concern there to make sure that our customers continue to enjoy direct unfettered access to the commercial markets in Mexico, and the Industrial base in Mexico enjoys the access that we provide to the United States market. We enjoy about two-thirds to 70% of that cross-border traffic today, and in the context of this transaction, we want to make sure our customers continue to have that competitive option available to them. Probably the second biggest item on our horizon at the STB is forced access or open access. There's a hearing on that coming up in March. We continue to work with the STB to help them understand our perspective of the dynamics of the rail industry and how to look at that possible regulation from a perspective that allows us to continue to serve our customers exceptionally well and continue to invest in our railroad so that, that service lasts for years to come. Then, finally, there's been work on final offer rate review at the STB. We've offered up with peer railroads an alternative to that and alternative dispute resolution mechanism. It looks like it's a nice simplification for small rate cases, small shipper rate cases, and it satisfies some of what we consider the big legal hair on the STBs proposal to have somebody else take on the role of rate mediation. Other than that, our job at the STB is to provide an excellent, reliable service product and stay engaged so that they understand the industry from our perspective. We do those two things, I think we can navigate the docket that's in front of us in the coming year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. I'll give you both the questions upfront. I guess, one, you've got a question earlier on kind of the momentum in contract wins, which is great to see you executing on your strategy that you laid out at the Analyst meeting, so kudos on that. I wonder if you can offer some kind of high-level thoughts on price versus volume. Presumably some of these bigger contract wins, price is a consideration. So how do you think about the kind of price versus volume focus maybe this year, next year? And is it a bit less on price and more on volume? Or just how do you think about that? Then the second question would be you're anticipating ramp in volume. You're ready to go at the terminals. But in July 2021, you had this issue where there just wasn't enough drainage capacity so you had a build-up of containers. Do you have visibility to drayage capacity or control over that, such that you wouldn't run into that issue again in 2022? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Kenny, you're probably good to handle maybe even both of those. Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. We're certainly pricing to the market, and that's an exchange in our overall approach to the market. We're selling a very strong, reliable service product. We're also backing that up with a lot of the capital that Eric and his team will be putting in to create a value proposition. So that's our approach to the market. That's how we're going to win. That's how we're going to grow. That's how we talk to our BCOs and all the customers on our network. To the second question about drayage capacity, yeah. We certainly see offline time. We see how much time the chassis are off, how much time the containers are gone. It's still not a very efficient network. It needs to come down, and as it comes down, it's going to create more volume growth, more efficiency for us. It'll be overall positive. So we're looking at that on a daily basis. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Eric, that looks better, but there's clearly still some work to be done there, right? Eric Gehringer : There still is work to be done there. And as we talked nearly a year ago Investor Day about intermodal being such an important growth engine for us, we also at the same time rolled out intermodal excellence. And if you look at many of those initiatives, they are focused on assisting our customers, on helping with the ability to be able to get quicker turns. So as I think about the work we're doing at nearly every intermodal ramp around our gate system and reducing the amount of time to get in and get out, that's helping them in that generating capacity. The work we've done on changing our UPGo app, whether it's for our existing customers or our new customers, we're making sure we continue to do our part to assist our customers to be able to generate that capacity. Now, to Lance's point, there's opportunity on the other side, but together I think we'll work our way through it. Lance Fritz : The only thing I'd add is that the congestion issues that you're referencing in particular, Tom, were really around the international intermodal side, and a lack of international chassis and dray drivers and some of our recent wins have been with on the domestic side with asset owners who come with their own chassis and driver fleets. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just one clarification. And you've been reporting RTMs weekly for some time now. Are your volume comments focused on RTMs or car load intermodal units? And on the volume outlook, a little more strategically, can you talk about any particular places where the gap between your bottoms-up conversations with your customers and sort of the tops-down anchoring that you gave today seem to either diverge in magnitude or maybe conviction? Thank you. Lance Fritz : So I'll start with that, Bascome. When we talk about volume and give you the volume guidance, we're talking about it on a carload basis. So that's consistent with how we had talked about it at the Analyst Day. And so we're talking carloads. Kenny, you want to talk about... Kenyatta Rocker : Let me chime in on the second question, the bottoms-up versus tops-down. Kenny, you have unique relationships with the commercial side and the buying side of a lot of our customers. At the CEO level, I'll tell you what my counterparts tend to be focused on is consumers are flush. Balance sheets for consumers are good, and they're financially healthy. So as long as their confidence isn't rattled, they seem to be postured to continue to purchase through the year. And the industrial economy, a lot of my industrial peers feel pretty confident that their marketplaces look pretty good to them, whether you're in the housing market, you're in the construction market, you're in some other aspect of our industrial economy. So at the very highest level, Kenny, that's what I hear. Eric Gehringer : Lance, you're spot on. And the only thing I would add is that we're not waiting around to think strategically about these growth areas from a geo perspective. And that's what you're seeing now with all the work that we're doing with Eric's team in terms of Inland Empire and the growth there and investments there, the Twin Cities, the growth there and investments there. You're going to see a little bit more volume in those areas than you did last year. That's intermodal. Also on the carload side we're also thinking very strategically about areas that you can call it high-growth population, you can call it high warehousing. When we see areas that are under-penetrated from a rail perspective, we're going to be opportunistic and really invest towards those areas. And that's what you're seeing with the train load facilities and the Inland Empire. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. I was wondering if you could share how much of a tailwind you're assuming from coal within the full year volume guidance and then also wanted to ask about labor availability. On a sequential basis, is it getting any better? Is it getting worse? And maybe you could just speak to your confidence in growing headcount to support that 5%-plus volume growth outlook. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thanks, Justin, for the question. We're not going to get into that level of granularity, but we did think it was important to acknowledge that coal is changing the posture from what we thought it was when we talked to you back in May from a tailwind to a headwind. And we're going to leverage that absolutely as long as we can, and the new business wins certainly help with that. You want to talk about the crew availability? Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Building off the previous conversation, we're in the market. It's certainly in some points, some locations just is a challenging market. As I think about looking throughout the year, some of the different activities we've taken on are meant to really differentiate us from other companies that are in the market as well. I think about not only employee referral programs that get the word out more in our social media campaigns. But I also think about the efforts we've taken in the last year where we're now talking to perspective employees that the day they come to the railroad is also the first day they can start college with us, that we offer that free of charge to them. So we're in the market. We're going to continue to put out what we feel is a very strong value proposition to join Union Pacific. Lance Fritz : And, Eric, you mentioned some self-help on crew availability, your strong move on reducing the re-crew rate by one-third or more. That in essence frees up some amount of our crew boards, and you're just generally more productive now with unproductive crew starts like held away from home terminal. And we also saw in the fourth quarter, starting to see the benefits of a high vaccination rate across the company and being able to have people be healthy. Eric Gehringer : We should talk about that, Justin. It's pretty much invisible to the outside world, but over three quarters of our workforce is fully vaccinated. And that's because we started early on complying with the federal vaccine mandate. Now, we paused because of the pause mandated by a court, but we think that our employee population, because of that high vaccination rate, lasted through Omicron a little better than the communities that we serve. We saw a spike in the number of our employees who had to quarantine, presumed positive or exposed, but it was nothing like the spike that we saw in the communities that we serve. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just a question just thinking about the trip plan compliance around the manifest business, which obviously has been under pressure. Although, as you say, things perhaps moving forward on that front. But just from a sensitivity standpoint, how critical is something like that metric to getting closer to a normal level to producing the operating ratio that you guys are targeting? I'm just trying to get a sense for how important is that for us to watch moving up in the thinking of relation to your targets for margin? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. I'll maybe start, and others may want to weigh in. But when we look at the key metrics that are driving the cost profile, which relates to certainly the operating ratio, I'd look more at freight car velocity and the terminal dwell numbers in terms of how efficiently we're handling the freight on the railroad. And that also has an impact on the number of turns that we're getting on the cars that we can put up against the customers to get that next revenue load. So I see trip plan compliance and intermodal trip plan compliance more as the outcome of these other things that we're doing in terms of moving the car and operating the network more fluidly being more directly impactful to the OR. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Jennifer, those trip plan compliance numbers are really about, can we serve customers in a manner that's consistent with our commitment? So that's about over the period of time that needs to be reliable so that we can continue to secure business and have happy customers. But in terms of hitting a high margin or a margin target, that's about car velocity, terminal dwell, locomotive productivity, and workforce productivity. And train life I'd throw in there as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to go back to the business wins, and certainly that's a positive and I think will certainly be viewed as such. But just wanted to ask the question. We did see a railroad, one of your northern peers, a number of years ago growing quite substantially, winning share, but when faced with some capacity constraints it kind of led to a significant gridlock that kind of prevailed for a couple years. So given the capacity constraints that we have right now, you're taking on new business, what comfort level do you have that you're not going to run into some of those issues over the next couple of years, even as global supply chain problems ease hopefully in the coming months and quarters? Lance Fritz : Walter, we are highly confident we have a plan in place and an existing network to be able to absorb the growth that we've been talking about this morning and not be gridlocked. Couple of cases in point. One, we've just onboarded Knight-Swift over the course of the last five weeks, four weeks, six weeks, and it's been flawless. That was on the strength of a lot of coordination and planning between ourselves and that customer in order to make sure their drivers were well prepared, that our ramps were efficient for their drivers, that we had good signage and our UPGo app to make it virtually seamless to get on and off. S I know we're going to be able to plan and execute in the same way for future onboarding.  The other thing to note is we've upticked our capital. There are some areas we need to invest in. There's that $600 million or so of commercial facilities and capacity. Historically, a lot of that spend would be targeted on productivity enhancement. As we look into this year, a fair amount of that spend is being targeted towards enabling growth. So we've got a game plan and the capital to be able to do it. We're well in advance of needing to put the capital in the ground, and so it's happening. Kenyatta Rocker : And that's where some of those investments that Lance referenced that were proud investments initially when you think about extensions become investments that support the growth of the network, and that's capacity that's not being utilized in that manner to date. And then think about our locomotives, which we still have a significant portion of our locomotive fleet that is stored today. So that's capacity that we have to bring to bear, and will be. Walter Spracklin : That's great. That's excellent color. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is more on a technology question. I'm sure you've seen that parallel systems initiative for autonomous electric vehicles that would maximize the use of existing rail networks. Your competitor weighed in on it. Just curious, is that something we should even keep an eye on? Is it a real initiative? And do you see it as possibly have it moving the needle for Union Pacific, if it were applied going forward? Or are there challenges associated with its implementation that are likely not going to bring it to bear? Kenyatta Rocker : Walter, we are interested the parallel systems technology. We are familiar with it, and it is of interest. It's of keen interest. Candidly, there's a lot of hurdles in front of that technology for deployment. Having said that, it could potentially be a game changer if it proves out to be effective and workable. So I'd say keep your eye on it, and we're keeping our eye on it. And I don't think it's going to impact 2022 or 2023 or 2024, but at some point it could be a technology that has utility for the U.S. rail network. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Ben Nolan : Thank. Appreciate you guys working me in. So my first question I guess relates to just thinking about the Schneider win that you guys had. When you're out pitching for new business like that, just curious how you are positioning the value proposition for you guys. Is it more about the economics, or is it service-oriented? Or sort of how do you pitch the competitive advantage that you're providing to your customers? Lance Fritz : Kenny, you're the one. Kenyatta Rocker : Yeah. Again, I'm really proud of the team. We've got a strong leadership team and the premium laid in that, but you know what we're doing is we're working as a team. And the first thing we do is we talk about our service products. We talk about where our network is and the capacity. Clearly, we had to put up some capital against that and some investments against that to help those carriers, those customers get into and get out of our ramps. We're very fluid. We're selling all those things. There's no part of it where we're changing our pricing strategy or approach to the market. We'll let the players really fight it out on the field and let their own efficiencies win out. So we're just selling our network. We've got a beautiful network that we've invested in, and that's what we're selling. Ben Nolan : Perfect. Thanks, Kenny. And for my follow-up quickly, Jennifer, when you talk about the 3% inflation, was just curious how you're factoring fuel cost into that. Jennifer Hamann : Great question, Ben. We don't factor fuel cost into that because of our fuel surcharge programs. And, yes. There's a lag, but we don't include fuel. And we're talking about our core inflation. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much, and good morning. Just a couple of questions on the operating side. Was wondering whether you could talk about if you've seen an uptick in your labor attrition rate if some of your peers have and how you're coping with that. And then just at a higher level, with regard to productivity to provide a partial offset to inflation, can you talk about how you're keeping the PSR mindset sort of alive and well throughout the company, particularly as you bring on new employees? Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Thank you for those questions, Cherilyn, and the first answer is actually really straightforward. If you look at a five-year average, we are not seeing increased attrition in our agreement professionals. Regarding your second question, there's a lot of ways that we continue to reinforce PSR, but really our flagship method is really the one we've employed for the last, this will be the third year in a row, which is our operating excellence classes. This is an opportunity for frontline leaders in the operating department all the way through executives that are in the front lines to be not only with one another in groups of 60 to 80 but also to be with me and the leadership team as we continue to define our PSR initiatives as we continue to evolve the railroad with more PSR initiatives. And they are hearing it directly from us. Most importantly, they're getting the chance to ask questions and ensure that we have alignment and also present their opportunities back to us. So we'll continue to use communication as our single best tool, followed by just a relentless focus on execution. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning. And sorry. I missed the first part of the call, so I don't mean to seem duplicative in my question. But Lance or Eric, your care plan compliance is down quite a bit, and I realize there's a lot of other outside factors right now during the pandemic. But for better or worse, this industry has a reputation when demand goes up or the economy heats up, volume goes up and service goes down. So I guess how do you think about that in the longer term context? Have we just cut too far under these PSR plans? Do we need to rethink labor and workforce levels? And is the CapEx level today the right level, or does that even potentially need to be reevaluated looking forward? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah, Brandon. This is Lance. I'm going to start because I've been crystal clear on this point with other audiences when I'm out talking. If you look at our historic record over the past handful of years, through our transformation we've improved our operating metrics when volume went down, particularly last year, and we improved them last year when volumes snapped back. So there's no reason for us to think empirically on Union Pacific volumes going to tank our ability to run the railroad. Having said that, what hurt us in crew availability primarily in the second-half of the year was, I think, we did not adequately address in our planning the reality of COVID and a third and a fourth way. Our planning profile said COVID is going to be around, but we're going to get used to it. It's going to have a diminishing impact, and we've got the resources necessary in that environment. What we did not plan for was a vaccine mandate where we have to give people time off to get vaccinated and waves where we had hundreds of UP employees unavailable to us on any given day because of quarantine. And I look at that and I think shame on us. That's a risk factor that we did not adequately plan for. And when I look into the future, we're going to just be a whole lot more relentless about and deliberate about the assumptions that we're building into our plans. Having said that, we're on the back side of getting that remedied, in part through being relentless on how we utilize crews that are available to us, and on the front side in making sure that we've got our boards staffed in a way that supports our crew consumption. And at some point in the future, COVID is going to go away, or it's going to be much less impactful. And I think at that point, that's going to be a wonderful day. But until then, we have to plan for it as a contingency, and that's what we've got built in. And I think we're going to be demonstrating that to you early on in this year. I see it in the statistics, and you will see it in the operating statistics as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning, guys. So Kenny or Eric, I guess, the question for you. On the intermodal growth you're putting out there, is this something that we should be estimating at 100% incremental to the current base and whatever growth forecast you're going to put in there? Or are there some customer losses, some remixing of the business that you're planning to do? I'm just wondering if we should be sort of thinking that this business comes in and the intermodal network is going to expand? Or are we going to be looking at this as only partially incremental growth? : No. This is clearly incremental growth for us. There's not a bait and switch or we change something or lost something. No. This is all incremental growth, and we're working very closely with Eric. Our team, Eric and I spend quite a bit of time talking about the intermodal network. David Vernon : All right. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, the volume outlook slide has a question mark for international intermodal. I'm just wondering is that a commentary on the congestion at the ports and the shipper preferences for expediting off the West Coast? Or is that a commentary that says, hey, look, ask me as the volume comes in. Warehouses are going to be full, and we should see import growth start to slow. I'm just wondering what is the meaning behind that question mark on the volume outlook page for international intermodal? Lance Fritz : Thanks for asking that clarifying question, and you're right. It's all about as we're slowly coming out of the Christmas holiday, I clearly believe that there is some natural timing to this, that we should see things work out. I've said that during the last part of the year, sometime in the middle of the year, but it's just going to be a gradual and slow increase to carloads on the international and intermodal side. But the short answer is that's what you're seeing. David Vernon : So that's more congestion than a macro comment? Lance Fritz : Port congestion for sure, as customers are now sending more to inland versus port-to-port. Lance Fritz : Yeah. I think where you're going with that, David, is there's nothing about in-market demand that we're building into the plan that says there's a collapse of the American consumer buying imports. David Vernon : Okay. Good. Thanks. I wanted to make sure that wasn't a macro thing. Thanks a lot, guys. And thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question. Jairam Nathan : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the system, so we have seen a lot of innovation especially on the truck side, and it's coming not only from within the industry but from outside the industry as well. So I'm just wondering. We haven't seen as much. How do you cultivate that? How do you kind of finance or fund it to bringing that outside innovation in the industry? Lance Fritz : Yeah, Jairam. This is Lance. Maybe we're just not doing an adequate job of talking about it, but our new CIO in Rahul Jalali, he is a exceptionally talented tech executive. And what he's got us doing is amplifying our internal development by speeding it up through minimally viable product, by being product and platform-centric and by deep and clear partnership with his internal customers so that we can tease out more rapidly and more fulsomely what's the next step in our tech investment and how quickly can we bring it to market. There are so many examples of that. We've talked a bit about some this morning, the UPGo app for drivers on our ramps, Intermodal Vision, the mobile apps for our crew base, UP Vision, just on and on and on. The second way that that's happening is through becoming much more open and embracing of external tech expertise, whether that's partnering up with Google, whether that's partnering up with somebody like TuSimple. There's any number of ways that we're exercising those kinds of partnerships so that we can learn from and absorb their expertise into our business. Tech is touching every aspect of our business right now in an accelerated and accelerating manner, and we're really, really excited about that. Jairam Nathan : Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, Jennifer, so if I go back to the quarters where you hit the 55% operating target, the volumes were about 5%, 6%, about, let's say, 4Q levels. But it looks like there are other things that is happening margins this year, right? Like productivity and pricing to some extent. So I'm kind of trying to understand how much is the volume impact in that 55.5% OR target, and how much other initiatives help? Lance Fritz : Let me start, Jennifer, with the mantra that you and I talk about all the time. Our ability to generate attractive margins is built on a three-legged stool. We look for volume growth, which we get to leverage. We look for productivity which we can leverage through volume growth and we can find in other ways. And we've got to have pricing that supports it as well. In 2022, we're going to see benefit from all three. Jennifer Hamann : I think that's part of why we're talking about incremental margins as well because that focus on growth, the new business opportunities that's coming to us, being able to move that really efficiently, pricing it well, and then dropping that to the bottom line. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Jeffrey Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. Jennifer and Lance, you addressed the question, what if congestion doesn't get better and the system doesn't get more fluid? And you mentioned that's part of your contingency. I'm going to ask it the other way. What if it actually does? Because, you know, sometimes when growth bounces back too quickly, the system can be challenged. You talked about the hiring of crews. You talked about how your crew boards are going to ease up as you move through this. But can you talk about it takes six to nine-months to train a new T&E crew? What kind of planning do you have to put in place if the volumes come in a couple percentage points above what you're looking for? And what kind of constraints would you be running into on the network? Lance Fritz : That's a great question, Jeff, and it's one that we scenario plan out for ourselves periodically as we go through our planning cycles within the year. First thing I would note is we worked really hard to reduce the amount of time it takes to get somebody off the street and to be qualified as a conductor. I think we've got that knocked down to something like 14 weeks, and so that's a substantial move in the right direction. Item number two is if we see volume overwhelming our ability to satisfy it, we've always got price as a lever that we can use that discourages some amount of that volume and helps it find a different home. And then we've got a lot of levers that we pull when it comes to managing the inventory, which is really the mechanism that bogs down the network. It's not the fact that more volume wants to move through the network. It's as if that volume doesn't move fluidly and it builds up inventory and now we're using our capacity in a really unproductive way. We've got a ton of mechanisms that we've developed over the past three years to make sure that inventory, if it comes on us, it moves through. And if there's too much coming on us for any one individual customer, we work directly with that customer to get them back in the box. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah, Lance. You hit all the key points. The only thing I'd add is it's less about the absolute volume number and it's also about where the volume comes on and in what products. And so that's where I think the team did a great job in 2021 being agile around that. We weren't expecting the chip shortages. We didn't expect the supply chain congestion, and the coal volumes were a blessing that came to us as well as increase on the grain side. So to be able to pivot quickly and be agile, that's why it's so critical that Kenny and Eric are linked at the hip in terms of talking about the trends, talking about the plan, and then executing to that. Jeffrey Kauffman : And just a follow-up to that. I heard Kenny recently talk about the great resignation and the challenge with bringing back from the furlough board. So have you worked your way through most of the furlough boards and have your arms around your ability to bring back employees? Or is that something that we're still probably going to be dealing within the coming quarters as volume begins to come back? Kenyatta Rocker : No, Jeff. We've largely depleted those furlough boards. The folks that we have called back are in training classes now, and we're really focusing. In terms of incremental adds to our network from a crew base, it's going to be on the new hire side. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Rob, thank you very much. You did a wonderful job for us today again. And thank you, all, for joining us today and for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in April when we discuss our first quarter results. Until then, I wish you all good health. Please take care. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fritz. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to reflect on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The people of Ukraine have had their lives turned upside down and the UP family is holding them close in our thoughts and in our hearts. We have leveraged our resources to help, with a $500,000 donation from our foundation and by matching 2 :1, our employees\u2019 gifts to select charities that provide direct aid. I also want to recognize the Union Pacific team for more than their generosity. They are a team dedicated to serving our customers. But recently, our service product has not met our customers\u2019 expectations. You will hear from Eric, we have an action plan in place to recover and it is starting to yield benefits. I am confident in our long-term ability to grow while providing our customers a reliable service product. As they have proven time and again, no matter the challenge, our employees rise to the occasion. Turning to our first quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 first quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to first quarter 2021 results of $1.3 billion or $2 per share. Our first quarter operating ratio of 59.4% improved 70 basis points versus 2021. Business development and a robust demand environment drove 4% volume growth in the quarter, coupled with strong pricing gains and the positive business mix. However, our service challenges are contributing to higher costs in the quarter. That performance is also having a real impact on our customers and their ability to serve their markets. We must improve to realize the volume growth we expect this year and into the future. So, let me turn it over to Kenny first for an update on the business environment. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Lance and good morning. First quarter volume was up 4% compared to a year ago. Solid gains in both our bulk and industrial segments were more than offset by a decline in our premium business group from continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 17%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 21% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 29% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two new contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products were up 1% in volume due to the increased biofuels production partially offset by fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand. And lastly, increased shipments of import beer and can goods were the main driver of the 4% increase in food and refrigerated. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue was up 16% for the quarter, driven by an 11% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 5%, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 6% compared to 2021 driven by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for Forest Products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by strength in both lumber shipments and paper. Despite rise in interest rates, housing starts continue to be strong, coupled with demand of corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 14% year-over-year due to the increased demand and a favorable comp from last year\u2019s gulf swarm that impacted production. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 25% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in the construction materials, strong steel demand and an increase in frac sand shipments. In addition, we had a favorable comp in our construction market from last year\u2019s storm that I mentioned earlier. Turning to premium, revenue for the quarter was up 14% on a 3% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and a positive mix in traffic. Automotive volume was up 6%, driven by an increase in auto parts as demand recovers. Shipments for finished vehicles were down 3% as a result of ongoing semiconductor shortages. Intermodal volume was down 5%, driven by continued international supply chain disruption. However, domestic volume was up in the quarter, aided by business development wins, tight truck capacity and continued strength in parcel shipments. Now, moving on to our outlook for the rest of 2022, at a micro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and the global events in both China and Ukraine will impact our overall volume. But as it stands now, here is how we view the outlook across our business lines. Starting with our bulk commodity, we expect fertilizer to grow due to solid market demand, especially on the export side. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to extend through the year. But when it comes to how much of that demand we can capture, that will depend on how quickly we recover our service levels. We are optimistic on growth with grain products from biofuel demand and business development wins. For grain, we have a tough comp to last year as exports were strong. And like coal, although we expect cycle times to improve, it is dependent on our service recovery. Moving on to industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets, like metals. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 levels. And lastly, for premium, we expect domestic intermodal to continue its benefit from inventory restocking, retail sales strength, tight truck supply and our business development wins. International intermodal is more uncertain with possible effects from ongoing supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdown in China. For automotive, while we do expect the supply of semiconductor chip to improve throughout 2022, recent events in China and Ukraine may disrupt the supply chain for certain key components. We are keeping an eye on whether this will have an impact on production and stand in close contact with our customers. As I wrap up, I want to share a few insights on how the commercial team is navigating the current service challenges. First, all of our discussions have been centered around what actions we can take to improve service. Eric will provide insight on the levers we are pulling that are in our control. Likewise, the commercial team is asking our customers to help reduce railcar inventory. While those conversations have been difficult, I am encouraged by the high level of engagement and transparency we are having with our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Kenny Rocker : Thanks, Kenny and good morning. As I will discuss in greater detail in a few minutes, our service is not to a level that meets expectations and we acknowledge the impact that deteriorated service levels are having on our customers. We are implementing plans to restore network fluidity and build a safer, more reliable and resilient network. Safety results have been mixed to start the year as we implement enhancements to our safety programs through partnerships and guidance from our external safety consultant. We remain focused on achieving world class safety performance. We value the health and the safety of our employees above all and want all employees to return home safely each day. Now, let\u2019s review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 9. Freight car velocity and the related trip plan compliance measures were lower relative to 2021. Coming into the year, the network was in a more fluid state, seeing improvements in operating metrics and crew availability from reduced COVID infections. In late February, however, while the network was still fragile, episodic events challenge the team and our service product. This led to both decreased velocity and an increase in freight car inventory, particularly private cars, as resources were added to counteract sluggish service and meet growing customer demands. Turning now to Slide 10 although the overall network performance muted most of our efficiency metrics, we continue to operate a more efficient rail network compared to pre-PSR levels. Locomotive productivity declined 6% compared to first quarter 2021 due to locomotive utilization during the quarter. To assist and recover in the network, we also brought additional units online, further impacting our productivity results. First quarter workforce productivity improved 5% to a record 1,056 daily miles per FTE. We continue to hire for growth and normal attrition throughout the network. In 2021, we graduated over 250 new transportation employees with almost 400 employees graduated to-date in 2022. We have a strong training pipeline of roughly 500 employees as we work closer towards our goal of onboarding around 1,400 employees this year. We have, however, been challenged across the Northern region at several locations to meet our hiring targets. And we continue to work with our workforce resources partners to increase our hiring pools in those locations. Train length is essentially flat compared to one year ago. While continued soft international intermodal volumes present a headwind to train length initiatives, we continue to advance train length for coal and manifest trains, which both grew compared to first quarter 2021. These productivity efforts are key to enabling us to recover the network and deliver a better service product for our customers. Turning to Slide 11 and a discussion on our path forward, this chart illustrates the current state of operations. Our operating car inventory levels rose over 20% since the beginning of the year, while our 7-day volume levels remained relatively flat week to week. We are at an inflection point and more critical action is needed. Our terminals remained fluid and our focus on improving over-the-road operations and reducing the number of active trains on the network will ease mainline congestion. To accomplish this, we are taking actions on all fronts by selectively increasing network resources, collaborating with our unions, adjusting transportation plans and working proactively with customers to reduce the private car inventory buildup. The entire team is dedicated to returning the network to a more fluid operating state. Looking beyond some of today\u2019s issues, our goal is to build a more resilient and consistent network to meet the growth needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric and good morning. Let me start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.57 and a quarterly operating ratio of 59.4%, 70 basis points of improvement. Comparing year-over-year first quarter results, you will recall that Winter Storm Yuri significantly impacted 2021. So in 2022, we have the positive effect to our operating ratio of 160 basis points and $0.16 to earnings per share. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge programs and widening spreads between WTI and highway diesel fuel prices negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 80 basis points, while adding $0.12 per share. Core results were a 10 basis point drag to the operating ratio, but contributed $0.29 to EPS. These core results are indicative of both operational inefficiencies in the quarter as well as the strong top line growth we delivered. Looking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14, operating revenue totaled $5.9 billion, up 17% versus 2021 on 4% year-over-year volume growth. Operating expense increased 16% to $3.5 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. First quarter operating income was a record at $2.4 billion, a 19% increase versus last year. Adjusted for fuel price, first quarter incremental margins totaled 56%. Expectations for full year incrementals are unchanged in the mid-60s, which is the lower end of our Investor Day guidance. Interest expense increased 6% compared to 2021, reflecting increased debt levels, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax increased 18% due to higher pre-tax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. We now estimate the full year effective tax rate to be around 23.5% as several states have lowered or are expected to lower rates. Net income of $1.6 billion increased 22% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in earnings per share up 29% to $2.57. Looking more closely at first quarter revenue, Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.4 billion, up 17% versus 2021. Broad-based volume growth supported by successful business development efforts, as Kenny discussed, contributed 425 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million increased freight revenue 800 basis points as the higher surcharge revenue reflects the significant surge in diesel fuel prices. The robust demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars. These gains combined with the positive business mix to drive 475 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower intermodal volume, combined with higher industrial shipments, drove the positive mix. Now, let\u2019s move on to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. As noted earlier, the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 74% on a 59% increase in fuel prices and 9% higher gross ton miles. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021 as the favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. First quarter workforce levels increased 1% as a 2% increase in our train and engine crews were partially offset by flat management, engineering and mechanical workforces. As you heard from Eric, we continue to hire into our transportation crafts to support network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 6% as a result of wage inflation as well as higher recrew over time and borrow-out costs related to network inefficiencies partially offset by last year\u2019s weather-related expenses. Given the current operational challenges, we now expect cost per employee to remain elevated into the second quarter. Purchased services and material expense is up 14%, driven by inflation, higher volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loop subsidiary and cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet. Equipment and other rents, was up 1% driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher state and local taxes and increased business travel. Turning to Slide 17 and our cash flows, cash from operations in the first quarter increased to $2.2 billion from $2 billion in 2021, a 14% increase. Our cash conversion rate was 85% and free cash flow of $657 million declined $146 million. This includes $312 million of increased cash capital spending and $93 million in higher dividends. The cash capital investment reflects both payments from elevated fourth quarter spending as well as a normalized start to our 2022 program. In the quarter, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes the $2.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program executed in February. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Wrapping up on Slide 18, I want to start by recognizing that several things have changed since we provided guidance in January, from fuel prices to our operational performance. As we sit here today, those pressures make achievement of around a 55.5% operating ratio unlikely. However, assuming some stabilization in fuel and recovery in our service product, we will still look to achieve our long-term goals of an OR that starts with a 55 this year. Importantly, we are affirming our previously provided 2022 targets for volume, price and incremental margins. Our cash and capital plans also are unchanged. Capital spending remains at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue, and we remain committed to an industry leading dividend payout ratio and share repurchases in line with 2021. Before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. Working in an outdoor factory is always a challenge, but especially so during winter. Our employees though are undeterred in their desire to safely serve our customers while delivering another quarter of solid financial results. Thank you. With that, I will turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : And thank you, Jennifer. As Eric mentioned, we have had an uneven start to the year with safety, but we are not deterred. We are in the process of implementing changes to our safety programs as a result of our work with experienced safety consultants. I am confident these changes will be a catalyst for world class safety performance. As you heard from Kenny, demand remains robust as our customers see growth opportunities in their businesses. However, we recognize that for growth to be sustainable, we need a reliable and resilient service product that our customers can depend on. Our strategy begins with serve and it is the foundation for achieving long-term success for all stakeholders. Improving our service product has our full and undivided attention. Current challenges aside, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that exist this year to win with all of our stakeholders and I am confident that 2022 will be a very successful year. Wrapping up with tomorrow being Earth Day, it feels appropriate to highlight an action we took during the first quarter to protect our planet and advance our journey to net-zero emissions by 2050. In January, we announced plans to purchase 20 battery electric locomotives for use in the yard operations, creating the world\u2019s largest carrier-owned battery fleet in freight service. These locomotives do not use diesel fuel and emit zero emissions. We anticipate the first units will arrive onsite in late 2023 with complete delivery by 2024. With this step, Union Pacific remains a leader on our nation\u2019s path to a sustainable future. So with that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Just kind of following up on the \u2013 on your outlook, obviously, it has a lot to do with enhancing hiring to improve the service. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how do you scale that up, Lance? What programs you can do to kind of meet some of these targets? And I guess, Kenny, the breadth of the letter and constraints on the company\u2019s limiting their assets, maybe talk about what \u2013 how that frees up the fluidity of the network as well? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thanks for the questions, Ken. So I will start. In terms of hiring, our hiring pipeline right now is pretty much fully charged at 500. We will be graduating something over 100 each month. That will help us get healthy. It\u2019s not like we need all 1,400 right now. But I would love to be able to add another couple of hundred into the network where we need them right now. That would really help us move our inventory through the pipeline, get it pushed up against our customers where they would like it. And so we are in the middle of doing that. When Eric mentioned some difficult areas, particularly in the northern tier, call it from West of Chicago all the way through Wyoming and into the Pacific Northwest, we are trying a couple of unique things there. One of the things that\u2019s showing really great promise is something called second chance hiring. It\u2019s where we take [indiscernible] of individuals who have made bad life decisions, but are really no longer a threat to society or themselves. And we work with a partner in the community to vet them and then take the best from that group and bring them on board. We have already gone through our first hiring class who are in the middle of training down in Houston and we have expanded that second chance hiring program now to Chicago, L.A., North Platte and it looks like it has great promise in those communities as well. So, there is a number of things we are doing both to make our jobs more attractive, to find bigger pools of talent and to develop talent so that it\u2019s ready to be in the railroad. And at the same time, we have reduced our training program from a timeframe perspective, not a content perspective, down to about 14 weeks, maybe 17 if we have a little bit more training to do in particular areas. So we are doing everything we can to get the pipeline charged and get them out. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Hey, Ken. We sent out a letter to all of our customers. And so that gave us commercially an opportunity to have a conversation with all of our customers and make them aware of what we are trying to accomplish. I want to thank our commercial team and thank the customers for having those engaging conversations. We work with Eric\u2019s team to ensure we had really good data-driven conversations with the customers that could give us the best opportunity to reduce the railcar inventory. And so we have done that. Trust me there have been some difficult conversations. But I will tell you, I have been very encouraged with the initial response from our customers and their willingness to reduce their railcar inventory. So we will continue to have those discussions. We will continue to engage them and be transparent and utilize data. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Lance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric, we have kind of been hit over the head with labor, labor, labor. It\u2019s the biggest issue. And when we look at the amount of people you are looking to add, relative to the size of your workforce, it\u2019s really not that large. So what are some of the other capacity constraints that are on the network right now? It feels like you exited 1Q maybe in a bit of a worse situation than you entered 1Q and how quickly can you remedy those non-labor issues to kind of help complement the additional headcount and can get you out of the situation a lot quickly \u2013 a lot quicker? Eric Gehringer : Yes, John. Thank you for the question. And to your point, right now, we have 1,400 people planned for hiring this year. We are on pace to do that. And we feel like based on how we forecast not only the volume we have now, but also the growth that, that\u2019s exactly how many we need to hire. Now, when you think about recovering the system, I mean, that\u2019s bullet number one. You have got to charge pipeline. And as Lance said, we\u2019ve done that. I go then beyond that, and I focus on crews that we have today, and are we being judicious with the use of those crews? You heard Jennifer state, we have opportunities in things like recrewing over time. Those are at the forefront of our efforts right now. Third, I\u2019d go down to locomotives. As you look at the locomotive fleet in the Union Pacific right now, we have the appropriate amount of locomotives on the system. We have opportunities to use them more productively, but they are the right number of locomotives. Then I go down to the transportation plan changes that we\u2019ve made. Those changes have been very specific and targeted towards eliminating the excess inventory off of the system. And then finally, we closed out with where Kenny started, working with our customers in partnership with them to reduce private car inventory. The faster we do all five of those, John, some of which have already been done, the faster we recover the system, and that\u2019s what everyone is focused on right now. Jon Chappell : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Lance or Eric, I guess, can you talk to the fluidity situation in L.A., Long Beack? And has that improved in any drastic quite? Lance Fritz : Let me get started, and then I\u2019ll ask Eric to add a little detail. We are encouraging our international ocean shipping partners to put more of their international boxes on our railroad to ship inland. As Kenny mentioned, that ratio is still lower than it\u2019s been historically. And they are all working towards adding more of that back into our network. But we\u2019re \u2013 we stand ready. The boxes that are pointed at us on dock are not dwelling in an excessive amount of time, and we\u2019d love to have more of those come on to the railroad. Eric Gehringer : And Brandon, when we look at that at a specific terminal perspective, Lance is exactly right. We not only have dwell right where we need it to be, it\u2019s a solid performance, especially relative to last year. But we also have excess capacity in those terminals. So as we continue to get more volume, we can handle that. Now we still want to be ready for that. So we have continued to put excess resources and an at-the-ready status. So they are not active, but they are available in the L.A. Basin. So as those surges come, we can handle them efficiently. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you, Brandon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I guess I want to try to understand a little bit what happened. It seemed like, Lance, you \u2013 even going back to the May Analyst Meeting last year, you talked about growth. And you really, I think, executed well against that strategy. But it seems like now you\u2019re almost \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say you\u2019re surprised by the growth, but there obviously have been difficulty handling it. So is there like a surprise on the attrition side? I know railroading is an outdoor sport. So sometimes you get a setback and it takes a while to recover. But I just \u2013 and then also, I feel like your commentary on labor not that long ago was that you had enough labor. So I guess I just wanted to \u2013 I guess, trying to see what might have happened? And then how much of that is ongoing, in particular with attrition? Is that the issue? Is that ongoing? Thank you. Lance Fritz : That\u2019s a great question, Tom. And let me unpack that for you, let\u2019s say, starting in the back half of last year coming into this year. We talked about, in the back half of last year, really struggling with crew availability, which was mostly we thought COVID-related. We just had not really done a great job in anticipating what COVID would do to crew availability, and we kept kind of struggling with having 300, 400, 500, 800 TE&Y unavailable to us at any given time. But we thought that our hiring pipeline had been charged up to a point where, as we were entering 2022, we\u2019d be able to handle the volumes. And that looked like that was proving out to be the case. When we spoke to you all in January, our operating metrics were improving. We were coming out of the holiday, and we actually felt pretty good about where we were. Now we knew we were fragile, but we thought we could navigate as we brought crews on board. What happened is we were more fragile, I think, than we give ourselves credit for. So in the back half of February, we started getting some body blows from what normally happens in winter. Usually, we have enough excess resources to be able to bring them to bear and clean out of it. This time around, we didn\u2019t. And as a result, we started getting behind inventory built up, and it\u2019s for the exact reasons that make all the sense in the world. As customers see us slow down, they put in more freight car inventory so that they get their need satisfied. And that then turns into kind of a self-reinforcing negative cycle. And that\u2019s where we are right now. So right now, we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019ve got more train and car inventory on us than we should have, given the volumes, and we\u2019ve got to work that off. And what Eric was talking about is making sure that we use our crews wisely, our power wisely, and our T plan is oriented towards doing that. So that\u2019s exactly where we are. And it\u2019s going to take us a while to work out of it. We\u2019re going to work out of it through the second quarter and into the third quarter. And my anticipation is we\u2019d see increment improvement week after week after week as we\u2019re doing that. Eric, is there anything you want to add to that? Eric Gehringer : I think you\u2019ve covered it exactly right. We would be most focused on those leading indicators of terminal dwell, car velocity, train velocity and operating inventory. And that\u2019s what we report publicly, so whenever you can continue to see that progress that we will be making a week after week. Tom Wadewitz : Is there a time frame for when it will be kind of fixed in your view? I guess, that\u2019s third quarter you\u2019re saying? Eric Gehringer : No, we haven\u2019t guided to a specific time line. I would reinforce the fact that as we see the hiring pipeline, we\u2019re getting about 100 crews every single month. Those 100 crews are incredibly important to the recovery. But so are the other four things that I listed. So what you should know is right now, everyone is focused on that and they are focused on how do we do that as quickly as possible. Lance Fritz : Yes, Tom, I would point you back to the KPIs that Eric mentioned. You\u2019ll see the recovery happen. You\u2019ll see it in car velocity that we\u2019d publish every week. You\u2019ll see it in terminal dwell that we publish every week, and you\u2019ll see it in overall inventory. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you, Tom. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR guidance. Obviously, there is a lot going on in the network operationally. But if I go back to prior pandemic levels, seasonally, you saw about 200 basis points of OR improvement sequentially in the second quarter. When we think about your full year guidance, would it be fair to say that it assumes a similar level of seasonality in the second quarter with the progression to the mid-50s in the back half of the year? Just curious if you can help us think through that quarterly OR cadence assumed in the guidance. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Excuse me, thanks, Justin, for that question. I believe you are thinking about it correctly. It really is going to be \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make improvements sequentially in the second quarter and then really leverage that back half as we see stronger volume growth and have greater operational fluidity to be able to hit those targets. Obviously, fuel, we\u2019re assuming some moderation there, but that\u2019s really the operational performance. And the leverage to that volume growth that we know is there, the robust demand that Kenny talked about, I think that\u2019s very important. Now I also have to acknowledge that second quarter of last year was our best quarter ever as a company. And so that\u2019s going to be a very tough comparison for us. And in fact, I would be remiss to say that we think we\u2019re going to see improvement in the second quarter, but sequentially on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we should improve, and that will lead to greater improvement in the back half. Lance Fritz : And support the guidance that you gave overall, which is a 55x for the year. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Justin Long : And volumes for the second quarter, do you think they\u2019ll be up on a year-over-year basis? Jennifer Hamann : That\u2019s really going to depend on the pace of the recovery. And \u2013 but I do think when we talked about volumes for the year, again, the first half was going to be driven by the bulk and industrial and the second half was going to be driven by more of that intermodal recovery and automotive recovery. While I think that\u2019s still largely the case, and you heard Kenny talk about the fact that there are some, I\u2019ll say, a little bit of headwinds or potential headwinds in terms of the international intermodal and the automotive recovery with what\u2019s happened in Ukraine and China. But you also have stronger natural gas prices into the back half of the year. So that\u2019s going to support that coal growth. So I still think you have that dynamic of a stronger second half overall in volume than you do in the first half. And in terms of Q2, we just need to really get the network fluid and try to move as much demand that sits there. Justin Long : Got it. Thanks for the time. Jennifer Hamann : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott \u2013 sorry, excuse me, Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with you question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jennifer, pricing and mix decelerated a decent amount from Q4. Any thoughts? Is that price or is that mix and any thoughts on how to forecast that? And then just on the operating ratio, I know you\u2019re raising it, worsening it, whatever, by 40 basis points. But I got to think that fuel is more than a 40 basis point headwind to what you thought at the beginning of the year. So is it \u2013 I know we\u2019ve got service issues we\u2019re talking about, but it almost feels like underlying guidance on margin ex fuel or underlying earnings guidance is actually going to be better than what you thought previously. Am I thinking about that right? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So let me hit your first question there, Scott, in terms of sequentially. So the pricing environment continues to be very robust. There is really \u2013 that demand environment is there. But you do have \u2013 sequentially, the mix is negative going from fourth quarter to first quarter. And that\u2019s really mix within mix. So yes, bulk and industrial are up intermodal or the premium piece is still down. But when you look at where the growth was on the bulk side, it really was coal, very strong coal growth. But when you look at the arcs relative to the other components of bulk, coal has the lowest arc. So you\u2019ve got that mix within mix impact. And you have a similar story within the industrial side when you look at where the growth was, and industrial strong across the board with the exception of Petroleum, but some of the strongest growth in metals, and that also has your lowest average revenue per car within that group. So that is the story in terms of the yield sequentially. When you look to the OR, fuel is certainly a headwind, but we see that headwind lessening through the year from an OR impact. And so we are looking at both the fuel and the operational performance, but the volume leverage. And that\u2019s the piece that I think maybe I need to stress the most with you all. And that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s within our control and the piece that we\u2019re working very diligently on, when we see stronger volumes coming in the second half, being able to leverage those very well with perhaps a little bit better mix. If you continue to have that industrial growth coming in a little bit stronger, I think that\u2019s how you get to the revised OR guidance. Scott Group : Okay. Just so I understand that point about fuel, are you assuming the fuel price comes down? Or just that you catch up on the surcharge, and so the OR impact is just naturally less as the year goes on? Jennifer Hamann : It\u2019s the latter that you say there. It\u2019s really a stabilization in the fuel price. And so we\u2019re catching up. And the fuel was going up a little bit in the second half of last year. So it\u2019s taking those two things together, Scott. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi, just sort of a big-picture question. Obviously, you and others put PSR and PSR methodology into play. And I know things are a bit unprecedented, but do long-term broader adjustments to how you think about precision-scheduled railroading need to take place? And is the resiliency after going through all that a surprise to the negative to you overall? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Yes. Jordan thanks for asking that question. So unequivocally, PSR has been a benefit to the railroad, even in our current environment. Let\u2019s go back to what it means. It means we try to touch cars the fewest amount of time necessary to satisfy demand for our customers and the customer need. So we don\u2019t do waste work. That by itself allows us to have excess capacity in both the terminals and in our line of road that we can use for other purposes. We also try to deconstruct our specialized networks where that makes sense so that we can have shared trains that are advancing cars more rapidly than it would otherwise. Unequivocally, when you look even at the way we\u2019re operating right now, when we have gotten into trouble prior to PSR, our operation would be worse, demonstrably worse. And we\u2019ve proven through the last 3 years that when we get into trouble in the PSR environment, we can get out of trouble more readily. Now what\u2019s happening right now is, I\u2019ll blame it on us. Shame on us, we got to a place where we did not have the crew availability for when something went wrong to be able to over resource for a short period of time and get it out of the network. And that\u2019s a tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a lesson. It\u2019s a tough situation to be in because we\u2019ve already learned that lesson. So as we look forward, what we have to do is make sure that our business planning processes for resources are rock solid and that we do a better job of making sure that our network and our resources and our plan is tightly coordinated with customers and their need and get them matched up, and match them up over a time frame that is the same as how we can add resources for growth. So yes, unequivocally, PSR is remaining the way to go. It is helping us manage the business right now, and that\u2019s not why we got into trouble. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Jennifer, that 65% incremental margin target for this year, is that compare \u2013 is that ex fuel or headlines? Because I\u2019m trying to understand if it\u2019s comparable to the 56 you did in the quarter or the 45 you did, including kind of a headline basis. Jennifer Hamann : No, that\u2019s a good clarifying question, Amit. When we talk to the incrementals, we\u2019re always talking about it in terms of normalizing for that fuel price. So that\u2019s comparable to the 56 that we reported here in the first quarter. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Okay. So yes, that\u2019s what I thought. And so the implication is, I mean, it\u2019s going to depend on what revenue growth is, but is the implication is that you guys are going to do a 53 to 55 OR cumulatively over 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, which is a big step-up in the context of kind of these ongoing service issues? One thing I wanted to clarify is the fuel surcharge, obviously, it was up 20% sequentially, but I assume you\u2019re going to take a very big step up in the second quarter, some of the March increase, and then maybe even subsequently third quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out the confidence around the next three quarters. And how much of that bridge, so to speak, of that step-function improvement is that absolutely just fuel surcharge revenue that comes on disproportionately the increase in fuel costs? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So I mean, we do still see the price of fuel being a headwind in terms of our OR. As I talked to Scott, we see that lessening through the course of the year, but we don\u2019t see that OR impact flipping and being a tailwind to our OR. So your math that you said in terms of the last three quarters of the year in terms of OR, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily agree with that. That seems fairly aggressive. But it is about seeing a stability in the fuel prices, which does allow the fuel surcharge, obviously, to catch up a bit. Lance Fritz : Well, and Jennifer, we also just need to circle back. There is one other predicate on that, and that is we are improving the service product through the quarter and through the back half of the year. Jennifer Hamann : Absolutely. And that goes back to the commentary about volume leverage. Lance Fritz : Yes. Amit Mehrotra : Great. If I could just sneak in one last one for Lance, which I think is an important question. Obviously, BNSF is making a bigger push into intermodal with its joint venture with Hunt. And Hunt\u2019s obviously the largest IMC out there with a big asset behind them, asset-based behind them. You guys have won a lot of intermodal business recently. Does that change your strategy in terms of what you need to do? Do you need to invest in the intermodal service to compete with this \u2013 your direct competitor that seems to be going all in on really putting a decent amount of investments at play to win more business in intermodal? Lance Fritz : Yes, Amit, I don\u2019t think it changes fundamentally our strategy in the domestic intermodal world. The BNSF and J.B. Hunt have always been formidable competitors. And what we\u2019ve done, by adding Knight Swift and Schneider along with having XPO and our long-term partner hub working with us, is we\u2019ve got channel partners that can grow very effectively against that. And when you combine that with our EMP and UMAX program for some of the smaller and midsized IMCs, we are fielding a really talented, very compelling story for BCOs to use us. It is no surprise that our primary competitor in BNSF and their primary partner in Hunt are doubling down on how they approach the market. And candidly, that kind of competition between us, our channel partners and them and their channel partners is fantastic for the users, for the customers of domestic intermodal. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question for Kenny or Lance, I wanted to think about sort of the overall demand environment. Clearly, I think there is business that\u2019s available now that you\u2019re not capable of moving from a service perspective. So, maybe a little bit of perspective on the amount of business that you may be turning away or sort of metering as it stands right now. And then thinking a bit bigger picture, what do we think the outlook is really for the rest of the year? I guess there is a question of overall consumer activity and the pace of demand as the rest of the year plays out. So I want to get a sense of what you\u2019re hearing from the customers in terms of expansion or contraction plans as they think about the rest of the year. Obviously, we\u2019re hopeful that as service comes back, there will remain demand being relatively strong, but I want to get a sense of what you\u2019re hearing on the ground? Lance Fritz : Yes, Kenny, do you want to handle that? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thanks, Chris. You\u2019ve set aside some of the macro things that we\u2019re delving on. We\u2019re keeping an eye on the inflation rates that are out there. Obviously, there have been some ups and starts with COVID disruptions in China. But when I look across each of our business teams, it\u2019s a very optimistic story. You look at our coal business, we talked about the two wins. None of us would have predicted that natural gas prices are as high as they are and are going to sustain where they are. Our grain business has been very strong. Last year was very strong. I tell you, the upside there is on the biofuels market and the grain products area, which is great. And then as we look throughout the rest of the year, we expect that export fertilizer demand will stay there. On the industrial side, really same story, I mean we have got some business development wins, but we\u2019ve also just got some structural things that are helping us out. Metals has been very strong. There have been some expansions on the plastic side. Those markets are still recovering and have been very strong. We will keep an eye on housing starts. The inventories are still low. There is still a backlog of houses that need to be built, so our lumber and our paper business has been strong. And then on the premium side, our auto parts and finished vehicles business still is not where it should be. It\u2019s improving. We talk to some customers. Car dealership inventories are around 24, 25 days. We see that improving as we move throughout the year. On our international intermodal side, the amount that\u2019s going IPI has improved or improved in the first quarter. We had some customers in here recently. We\u2019re expecting them to turn on more of that volume. So the things that we can control, we feel really good about \u2013 domestic intermodal has been up, as I mentioned in my commentary. So from what we can control, we feel good about. We just got to keep an eye on some of these other things that are out of our control. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, I want to brag on your team for a moment. You\u2019re doing really tremendous work on business development, on pure business development, the singles and doubles, where we bring on a customer, we grow with an existing customer through service enhancement and enhancing the overall customer experience. Even in the context of the service issues that we\u2019re facing right now from a service product perspective, behind the scenes, the overall customer experience, we continued to invest in that and continue to make progress. Kenny Rocker : Yes. They are out there and engaging the customer. Lance Fritz : Yes. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I do want to follow-up on the domestic intermodal expectations into the back half, because it\u2019s kind of based on what you said about the competition with the BN as well as expectations for the truck market to loosen in the back half of the year, I\u2019m kind of starting a little bit if what the tailwind is on the domestic intermodal side that will get that to accelerate in the back half of the year? So are there new contracts coming on kind of what gets that to go up? So that\u2019s question number one. And question number two is if you can give us a little bit of a sneak peek into the STB hearing in a few days, kind of obviously, you guys have spoken a lot about service challenges and everything you\u2019re doing right now. But what do you think is going to be the outcome on that curing? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Kenny, why don\u2019t you handle the back half domestic intermodal question, and I\u2019ll get to the STB after you\u2019re done. Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thanks, Ravi. A couple of questions there, and it sounds like demand and also the pricing environment. We\u2019re about 40%, almost close to halfway through our bid sessions on the domestic side, and it\u2019s been favorable versus last year. Last year was also a pretty a strong, solid year. Now the spot rates have gone down here recently. So we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on that. But I\u2019ll tell you, the overall demand has not changed. And so we\u2019re going to continue to look at that over the next a few weeks as we\u2019re in those competitive bids. Again, we brought on the night swift business, but we do have more volume that coming on as we look at the back half of the year. The other thing is that we just need the supply chain to work itself out. Chassis dwell is still not really where it should be. The dwell of containers is not really where it should be. So we will see some improvement there. And then you made some comments about our primary competitor in the West. And I want to echo what Lance said. The pie is much larger than the primary competitors in the West. And we\u2019ve had so much investment as you look at the ramps in Inland Empire, Twin Cities, everything we\u2019re doing with GPS. We want to compete with truck, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Lance Fritz : Yes. And as we improve the service product, Kenny, get that reliable, we\u2019re in great position to take more trucks off the highway. It just makes all the sense in the world, including an ESG perspective. Ravi, your question on the STB hearing clearly, the entire rail industry is in a place where we\u2019re as a collective, not providing the kind of service that our customers demand. The STB appropriately is hearing from customers and want to talk about it. That\u2019s what next week is all about. We\u2019re well prepared for those conversations and to share with the STB how we\u2019re investing and planning to continue to improve and recover and then be stable going forward and reliable and consistent. And I think that\u2019s going to be a great opportunity to have that discussion. We\u2019re going to encourage the STB not to make rush or knee-jerk decisions in this environment. There are some things on their docket that I would guess, I would imagine, somebody will advocate as solutions. And that from our perspective, this is all about getting our labor right, getting utilization right, making sure the other resources are ready and then executing. It\u2019s not much more complex than that right now. Ravi Shanker : It sounds good. Thank you both. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Hi. Good morning everyone. So Lance, you mentioned over resourcing or the ability to over resource. And I guess my question is really, if that is limited only to your ability to ramp up labor, or are you looking at ways? And do you feel like you need to look at ways to extend your capacity from an infrastructure standpoint, be it on track and locomotives and so on? It just goes back to the STB, some of the discussions Chairman is having about, the lack of railroad ability to invest or the historical decision not to invest that is leading to the lack of available capacity. And I wonder how would you respond to that and particularly, if it\u2019s just a labor problem or if you need some more capacity and investment in your network as well? Lance Fritz : Yes, Walter, we take a great exception to anyone that points at our historic track record and says we are under investing in our railroad, right, when you spend $3 billion, $4 billion a year, that\u2019s not under-investing. And look at the statistics, look at the facts. You go back 4 years or 5 years, we would have 800 or 900 trains on our network at any given time. Today, we are overloaded by plan at 700. That number should really be 600. And our network has had incremental investment put into it. That\u2019s what I mean by making sure we have excess resources. We have done that through the implementation of PSR in terms of, we have excess terminal capacity that we can use by having mothballed certain terminals that we no longer needed in the T-plan. We have got plenty of line-of-road capacity that we can use, and we continue to invest there so that we can continue to grow out efficiency, safety, productivity and growth in targeted areas. So, when I am talking like that, I am really talking about the more fungible resources like crews and locomotives. And locomotives were in great shape, right. We have a strategy where we have at-the-ready locomotives positioned around the network, so that we can fire them up when they are needed and then put them back once we have gotten out of the situation. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 to your point, Walter, it\u2019s really back down to crews. Historically, we have had boards, alternative work and training service boards where we would be able to have people not going to furlough but go into kind of a quasi status where they are still getting paid, they are still getting resources from us, their benefits package in its entirety. And that allows us to call them back more quickly if something happens in a demand profile that we didn\u2019t expect. We need to get back to a place where we have got those kinds of resources available to us, and we are looking at all of those. But job one that we talked about, first and foremost, is making sure we get crew utilization and crew availability and total crewing right, so that we can handle the volume we have got in front of us and the growth that\u2019s coming. Walter Spracklin : I think that\u2019s a great answer. And do you think that\u2019s resonating with the STB, or what is your sense that, that answer will kind of give you some \u2013 at least some time to kind of prove it out over the coming quarters and years, or do you see risk that they may take action to force you to invest in capacity above and beyond all the capacity investments you just mentioned? Lance Fritz : Walter, I am an optimist, and I am hopeful that the facts, which support what I just talked about, speak to the STB. And we are effective at communicating that. Walter Spracklin : Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Sorry. Two questions for you on the domestic intermodal side again. Eric, as you are resourcing the network right now, obviously, Kenny\u2019s team has done a good job bringing over some fairly big accounts in 2023, will you have enough capacity by the end of the year to accommodate that, or will there still be an incremental growth required in resource into 2023 to accommodate that, those intermodal share wins? Eric Gehringer : Yes. So, thank you for the question. David, we will have the capacity to be able to host that additional volume. Now as we have been working through the on-boarding process, that\u2019s part of that process is to ensure that we are making the necessary investments. And it\u2019s not always capital investments. Oftentimes, it\u2019s just process improvements. For example, considering the fact of Knight-Swift and Schneider now having their own chassis, and how do we think about that and optimize our terminals to account for that? When I am out on the railroad, I see the output of those efforts. When I see us getting near completion on our G4 gantry cranes, when I see us buy an additional lift equipment, the work that we are doing on the Inland Empire and the Twin Cities Intermodal Terminal, those are all in response, not just Knight-Swift and Schneider, but to the entire volume and growth that we see coming and being ready for all of our customers to benefit from that. David Vernon : Alright. Thanks for that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. When we think about the 20%, 30%, 40% growth in the domestic container fleet we are going to be seeing over the next couple of years, it sounds like a lot of private equipment is being added. What do you guys think that your intermodal franchise is going to look like from an equipment perspective 3 years, 4 years, 5 years down the road? Are you also going to be resourcing containers into the UMAX and the EMP programs, or are you going to be allowing your channel partners to make those investments in trailing capacity? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Kenny, do you want to handle that? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I mean we feel really good about our strategy to go in and invest in our equipment that we have out there with EMP and UMAX. I talked about the GPS earlier. You have heard me talk about the chassis investment. We see that we can win across the board. We can win with the private asset side and with the IMC community, and we want to grow that pie. And so that\u2019s how we are thinking about it. As other private asset carriers are out there, we will engage them on their strategy. But clearly, we don\u2019t want to put any limits on anything that would inhibit growth. Lance Fritz : I would guess, Kenny, given the growth that we are seeing first through Knight-Swift, then with Schneider and the continued growth of Hub, it\u2019s probably fair to say the ratio of privates versus EMP, UMAX on us grows towards the private side. Kenny Rocker : That\u2019s good. Yes. David Vernon : Alright. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So clearly, a lot depends on service improvement here in the next couple of quarters. Just wanted to get your sense, Lance or Eric, about just the risk to the plan, what are you really focused on? What are you really worried about? And then, Lance, you did mention a few things on how to get this more sustainable in the future. There will always be labor and volume variability. But is there something else you feel like that UP or maybe the industry overall needs to get better at in terms of being able to manage these ebbs and flows a bit better and then being able to grow from there? Lance Fritz : Well, why don\u2019t I start with the back half of that question, Brian, and then I will turn it over to Eric on the front half in terms of some of the bumps in the night that you are planning for, that you are mitigating. So, in terms of how to be more resilient and robust, there is a lot to that question. Some of it is our direct control. Some of it has to be in partnership with our customers. So, what\u2019s in our direct control, we have to make sure that our jobs are more flexible and more attractive and easier to hire into. So, one thing that we are in the middle of right now as an industry is trying to get to a place where two people in the cab or a locomotive are not mandated and negotiate with our union partners on moving one of those people onto the ground. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but that one person on the ground can turn into a shift job and stay at home as they are doing their work. That\u2019s a huge lifestyle benefit to that person as opposed to going over the road, staying away from home and then coming back and being called at potentially all hours of the day. So, that \u2013 it\u2019s not obvious how that connects back into being more reliable, more resilient, more consistent, but there is an obvious connection from our perspective. There is other things like that, that are smaller that we need to do. I talked about oughts and getting back to a place where we have not excess manpower sitting around, but our labor force, our craft professionals are more flexible to go to where the work is and do the work when it\u2019s needed and still have an enhancement in their work-life balance. So, there is a lot of work that we have to do with our unions on property and negotiation and national in negotiation and then just in how we design our boards and our team plan and our work overall. Eric, do you want to handle that first part? Eric Gehringer : Yes. So, Brian, as you think about the recovery and what are we doing to de-risk that, I would first start off with just the basic fundamentals of, we are coming out of winter. We are coming out of a period of time where we have seen higher variability. As we come into spring, it\u2019s a period of time in which we have been more consistent, especially with the impact of weather. Second, we have mentioned it a couple of times, but it\u2019s really the most important thing as we sit here right now. If you look at previous times of service challenges, it\u2019s been in our terminals. We have been able to get the volume to the terminals, but then the volume in the terminal starts to slow the terminal. That\u2019s not the case right now. The case right now is that we have fluid terminals, both our large terminals, our serving yards and our locals getting to customers. That must stay that way. So, the way we think about bringing trains into the terminals and landing them on time, but also properly space so we can handle it, so we don\u2019t get a backlog. That\u2019s de-risking it. If you look at another way as we talked about crews, we are in the crew-preserving mode right now. We want to make sure that every crew we call counts. One of the ways we do that is with train length. So, if you go back all the way to January, we were sitting around 9,000 feet on a system average. We added 200 feet to that in January, another 200 feet in February and March and another 150 feet year-to-date. That\u2019s de-risking the recovery. That\u2019s ensuring that we are taking every opportunity we can to minimize the number of trains out on line of road. So, it\u2019s all activities like that, and that\u2019s what the entire team is focused on. Brian Ossenbeck : Alright. Thank you, Eric. That\u2019s very helpful. Lance, if you can just give us some quick thoughts on the CPKC merger. I think the responses back from CP are due tomorrow. So, any updates on the concerns that UP has voiced in that would be helpful. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yes. Brian, I would just reiterate what our concerns are. It really boils down to three things that we think we need remedies for. The first is for our customers to continue to enjoy the kind of access they have to and from Mexico we need certainty on price that\u2019s competitive from the border into Mexico. We think about that like prop rates. Second, we need to maintain what we have today with the KCS, and that is fair treatment, equal treatment at the border crossings on the bridge. And third, the KCS and CP have talked about a significant spike in converting truck to train and moving it on our trackage rights through Houston. Houston is a congested area. It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s not congested in a bad way. It\u2019s a high-volume area that requires a lot of attention. If you introduce another 8 or 10 trains a day into that network in a rapid period without having the capital in place first, it will tilt Houston, and we can\u2019t accept that. So, we want to make sure that if they are going to execute that plan and it\u2019s going to increase the amount of train traffic through Houston, the capital is spent in advance, so it doesn\u2019t crater Houston as a result. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you, Lance. I appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. You had mentioned a number of notable steps, obviously, towards your sustainability target. But as you are having conversations with new business development, I guess one, is that being recognized? And then as a part of that, is that becoming increasingly important in their decision to execute with UNP towards an agreement? Just any thoughts there? Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you, Allison. Kenny, do you want to take that? Kenny Rocker : Yes. We have a number of customers that have always wanted to know where we are on ESG and sustainability component. And we are seeing in the RFPs and the formal RFP more focus there. Those customers are typically in the petrochem area, more customers that have \u2013 that are, I will call them, consumer-facing type customers. So, we do know that it\u2019s in their methodology. I will tell you the other thing is that our commercial team is sitting down with our customers and walking through the value that we provide by them moving Union Pacific and actually selling that. So, yes, it\u2019s more awareness on the customer part and more proactive engagement from our commercial team to fill that as part of our value proposition. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Hi. Thank you, operator. Lance and team, good morning. I wanted to go back a little bit to the intermodal side. As you think about your base case scenario on the international side, what\u2019s in it in terms of potential clogging up of the supply chain again? We have talked to a bunch of people, and there seems to be some worry here that we have had a bunch of black swan events over the last couple of years. Now we got another one with China ports just withholding all these shipments coming in. If they all come back to the ports at once, I don\u2019t think a lot of people have confidence that they are going to be able to handle it. What\u2019s UP set up like into the summer? And how do you think you are going to handle that? Lance Fritz : Let me start, and then I want to turn it over to Eric and Kenny to kind of add a bit more detail. But I want to, Jason, focus in on the partner side with railroad, what we need to depend on so that the network doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed. I am in part in agreement with you that we are not yet in a place where labor and distribution centers and warehouses and dray truck companies is at a place where it could take an onslaught of significant volume in the international intermodal space. So, that we still need more hiring and more labor available in local truck companies and dray companies and in distribution centers. But Kenny and Eric, what about us? Kenny Rocker : Yes. The \u2013 I mean I think you hit it on the head, I would say. And I am looking at Eric as I say that we feel good about the condition of our intermodal network as it stands today. We have been working very closely with the customers to make sure that we have a really clear forecast of what\u2019s coming towards us. We have been through the technology where we can to do that. But yes, these tough are out of China. We have got to keep an eye on it because there is going to be another slug of containers that are coming to us. Eric Gehringer : And one of our biggest opportunities that we have been leveraging really for now almost a full year is we are active members on the White House Working Committee that allows us to interact with all the different stakeholders on the West ports. And what it is providing us is even better transparency into different events that are happening up chain that it comes down to us, it allows us to understand weeks, sometimes months out, on who we have to think about resourcing for that. And we will continue to be active in that because it continues to help the entire industry out in the West Coast. Jason Seidl : Okay. So, if I had to sum that up, an onslaught of freight would still be difficult to handle, but now you guys have better visibility than you did, let\u2019s say, a year ago throughout the system? Lance Fritz : That\u2019s fair. Eric Gehringer : Yes, absolutely fair. Jason Seidl : Okay. I want to follow-up real quickly, getting back to the STB for a second. There was obviously hearings out there on reciprocal switching. I am not going to make any prognostication on where that\u2019s going to go. But just wanted to in terms of your exposure in terms of your total business, what percent of your business would be exposed to reciprocal switching that would come to the U.S.? Lance Fritz : That\u2019s hard to nail down and give you a number right now. All I would say is we are concerned and deeply engaged with the STB to help them understand what reciprocal switching \u2013 we will call it forced open access, could do and what it couldn\u2019t do. It is not a wholesale remedy to, for instance, remedy fix current supply chain problems, right. What forced open access would do is we put switching in places where it isn\u2019t right now. It would increase dwell time on freight cars. And those are two things that we absolutely don\u2019t need. Now that\u2019s not to say that there can be a circumstance where it might make sense for somebody, and it already does exist in very limited areas where we have agreed with other railroads that a reciprocal switch is needed or where the STB has mandated it through conditions on previous transactions. So, we continue to work with the STB to help them understand our concerns, what \u2013 how it could help, how it couldn\u2019t help and then get to a place where, if there is action taken, it\u2019s sensible. Jason Seidl : Thanks guys. I appreciate the time as always. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Thanks. So, I have sort of a two-part question maybe for Kenny. First, on the coal, the ramp-up that you guys have seen has been pretty remarkable, but you talked about higher natural gas prices, incentivizing more. I was curious for what is your ability to sort of continue to toggle up there? And then similarly, what\u2019s the ability of your customers to also toggle up? And then on the petroleum side, I guess I am a little surprised that there is not more volume growth in that market given how much drilling activity there is and everything else just domestically around the oil and gas side, maybe a little color on that. Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thanks a lot, Ben. Yes, on the coal side, again, you have got two different things. You have got some business development wins and you also have the natural gas prices. Certainly, we didn\u2019t predict last year that the natural gas prices would be in the $7 range. And as it stands here today, I will tell you, I \u2013 it\u2019s encouraging that, that forecast is throughout the rest of the year. As we talk to our customers, we don\u2019t see that they have made any capital investment per se in terms of trying to get more of that out of the ground. But we do know that they have done quite a bit of hiring to get more utility and get more product out. And so we are working with them on that, and we stay very connected with Eric\u2019s team from a forecast perspective. And then yes, I understand your perspective with petroleum. And what you should think about is just a part of that, that\u2019s not here this year is our crude oil business. And those spreads between Canada and call it, the Gulf for Texas are just not where it should be. And so that\u2019s the impact that you are seeing there. We do see, to your point, the drilling show up in other commodities. We are seeing a lot of drilling pipe, OCTG, that\u2019s moving. I talked about the frac sand. There are some other industrial chemicals that go into the drilling process that we are seeing. So, that\u2019s where that\u2019s showing up on our railroad. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, in that context, the heat of that market doesn\u2019t look like it did the last super strong cycle we had in places, like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. There seems to be a little bit more discipline on capital spending, and they are slower in walking up production. Kenny Rocker : Absolutely. Ben Nolan : Alright. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and thanks for squeezing me in here. A lot\u2019s been asked about short-term and service and short-term disruptions. Kenny, I want to focus a little longer term, really on three things. Number one, given the instability off the West Coast, we have seen a lot of shippers go to the East Coast. So, the first part of this is how do you see that playing out? And what are your customers telling you longer term? And then secondly, I know Lance was talking about the company\u2019s donation to the efforts in Ukraine. But as we talk longer term, are any of your customers approaching you and saying, \u201cListen, what\u2019s going on out there has changed the ability to move product around the globe. How can Union Pacific help us?\u201d And then the topic of re-shoring, which I know hasn\u2019t really happened to a large degree yet. But in the long run, I know a lot of customers are rethinking this. So, maybe talk about those three areas opportunities, say, over a 2-year, 3-year, 4-year period for UP. Kenny Rocker : It\u2019s interesting that you would bring that up on the international intermodal side. It\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going to be a one-off versus a permanent change from, I will call it, directional shipment of international intermodal. We have worked with an international carrier here where we do have a move that\u2019s coming East to West. And so we are excited about that move. And again, we will see what happens there from a permanent basis. Yes, I believe that some of the global disruptions will make our customers think about where they source from. And we are hearing more conversations about near-shoring. We have not seen those investments to really mirror those conversations. And then as you \u2013 I think the last question was about the Ukraine and those thoughts there, we are always talking to our customers about solutions that we can provide them. So, when you think about the six border access, Mexico is clearly one. I just gave you an example of going from East to West. We still feel very good about our products moving off the West Coast, and we have got really solid relationship from anything that wants to come out of Canada. So, we are prepared. We have got $600 million in investment on our intermodal network. So, we are prepared for more growth. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today will come from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. Just a quick one for me. As we start to move towards peak season, I was just hoping you could talk about the current state of the Chicago Gateway, both in terms of your own terminals, but also your interchanges with the other rails, rage capacity and so forth. Eric Gehringer : Sure. Yes. Cherilyn, so if we look at our \u2013 I want to speak specifically to Chicago first, but the same would be true as we look at Memphis and as we look at even New Orleans. Right now, those all remain fluid from an intermodal perspective. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t work through challenges on a day-to-day basis as we work through interchange issues. But we have strong relationships with the other carriers. We work through those issues. And right now, I am very happy with where those terminals are. If we were asking about one I am most focused on, it\u2019s just simply New Orleans, and it\u2019s always one that we are focused on the most because it\u2019s such a tight amount of track and operations in a really small area, but otherwise, no concerns at this point. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : Alright. Thank you, Cherilyn. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Alright. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for engaging with us this morning and for your questions. We are looking forward to talking with you again in July to discuss our second quarter results. Until then, take care. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. And welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. As we expected and shared back in April during our first quarter earnings call, the second quarter was a tough quarter. Our initiatives to restore fluidity limited car loadings and increased operating costs. Those actions are working. We made solid progress improving the network with increased car velocity, reduced Cardwell and reduced excess inventory. But before we get into that discussion, I want to recognize the Union Pacific team that is making it happen. Our people truly are special and they are the foundation of our long-term success. Now turning to our second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific\u2019s reporting 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.93 per share. This compares to the second quarter 2021 results of $1.8 billion or $2.72 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.2% deteriorated 510 basis points versus 2021. Network recovery efforts and record high fuel prices were headwinds. However, fuel surcharge revenue, strong core pricing gains and a positive business mix offset these pressures to produce operating income growth. As we discussed during the quarter, we understood that the actions we took to improve fluidity would impact our financial performance. Those actions were necessary to increase the speed of our recovery and be in a better position to handle customer demand. The improvements we have made since mid-April gives me confidence that will grow volumes as we continue to improve service in the third and fourth quarters. There\u2019s more to be done, but we are moving in the right direction. Let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Second quarter volume was down 1% compared to a year ago. Growth in our industrial was more than offset by a decline in our Premium and Bulk business segments. To improve network fluidity, we make reductions to our active freight car inventory and those efforts had a negative impact on all three of our business groups. In addition, our intermodal volume was down due to continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 14%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 10% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 1% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 2% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two new contracts wins that started on January 1st. Grain and grain products volume was down 4% due to fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times, partially offset by increased shipments of biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were down 2% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of sulfur and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter, as inventory reduction efforts eliminate car supply. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue was up 12% for the quarter, driven by 6% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Overall volume was up, although, we certainly left demand on the table as we took actions to reduce car inventory to improve the network. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by improvements across various markets, partially offset by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for forest products was down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by our service challenges, although overall demand for forest products remain steady in the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 3% year-over-year, due to new business winds and demand within the plastics market. Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increase in frac sand shipments and metals business development. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 19% on a 5% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 26%, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was up 11% driven by auto parts, which increased 12% and finished vehicles increasing 10%, both driven by strong demand against the software comparison. Intermodal volume went down 8% primarily driven by service challenges and fewer international shipments from continued global supply chain disruptions. Domestic volume was up 1% in the quarter aided by tight truck capacity and private asset growth, offsetting weaker parcel shipments. Now moving to our outlook for the back half of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But based on our conversations with customers, I am excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. Let\u2019s start out with our Bulk commodity. We expect biofuel shipments to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices throughout the year. We know there\u2019s more demand available than what we have captured to-date, so our opportunity to better match our resources to that demand and our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery, where we expect cycle times to improve. But we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter, as exports were strong last year. Moving on to industrial, our outlook has not changed. We expect our markets to be stronger than the current industrial production forecast. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 level. And lastly for Premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand by truck rates of softness. We expect to see improvements to international intermodal with the recovery from the supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdowns in China. However, we will continue to monitor [Technical Difficulty] we maintain fluidity throughout the entire supply chain from the ports to the warehouses. In spite of elevated fuel prices and interest rate increases, we expect automotive growth in the second half of the year to be driven by improving supply of semiconductor chips and pent-up demand. Overall, I am optimistic about the demand environment we see in the marketplace, as we head into the third quarter and you will hear from Eric that we are seeing positive momentum in our service product. I want to thank our operating team and our customers for working together to recover our service levels. As we continue to improve the network, I am confident that we can capture more growth in the back half of the year and into 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Beginning on slide nine, as we discussed in April, we began the quarter with our service product in need of significant improvement. To recover the network and better serve our customers, we implemented decisive measures to reduce inventory levels and restore fluidity. The chart on slide nine shows the current state of operations. We hit a trough in April and have since made steady progress. While the improvement has not been a straight line, because of continued crew challenges and isolated incidents, the team has stayed the course to build momentum and generate positive results. We experienced reduced crew availability from the Father\u2019s Day and 4th of July holidays as we expected and planned for. We have, however, recovered from those holiday impacts and return to our prior improvement trajectory. We continue to see the benefits of our hiring initiatives and feel confident in our ability to hire and train approximately 1,400 new transportation employees this year. To-date in 2022, we have graduated 486 employees and have an additional 504 currently in training, with almost 400 of those employees graduating by the end of the third quarter. Although, the hard work is not yet done, I am encouraged by the improvement already made. I would be remiss to not acknowledge the efforts and cooperation from all to the operating and marketing and sales teams within UP, and most importantly, our customers. Our network is in a better state today because of these combined efforts. Now let\u2019s review our key performance metrics for the quarter starting on slide 10. The key performance measures for second quarter 2022 continue to trend below 2021 results. We did however strengthen freight car velocity, as well as manifest and auto trip plan compliance sequentially as we move through the quarter. Intermodal trip plan compliance continues to lag results from earlier in the year due to continued supply chain congestion resulting in increased container box dwell and elevated chassis street time. Our attention remains on increasing freight car velocity, which will improve intermodal service performance. Although, the challenges associated with the supply chain will likely persist. Turning now to slide 11, the network efficiency metrics for the quarter illustrate the impact of our network recovery actions. Since the beginning of the year, we have added locomotive to the network, which when coupled with lower train velocity impacts locomotive productivity results for the quarter, declining 12% compared to 2021. As we anticipate volume growth heading into the second half of the year, locomotive productivity will improve with better fleet utilization, as we move more car loads at a greater overall velocity. Second quarter workforce productivity deteriorated slightly down 2% as car miles were essentially flat for the quarter, while employee levels increased. Train length remains flat compared to one year ago. However, train length is up 3% sequentially. The team leveraged train length to improve crew utilization aided by the completion of 10 sightings to-date in 2022. We continue to identify productivity opportunities as we build a more resilient and high quality service product for our customers. Wrapping up on slide 12, we remain committed to the goal of achieving world class safety performance. The improvement in our employee incident metric provides evidence that the enhancements we made to our safety programs are beginning to take hold. While the derailment rates have not yet improved compared to 2021, we continue to educate our workforce to ultimately reduce variability and expense. The swift and decisive initiatives implemented in April reduced congestion and sped up the network, an increase in crew supply will further support these recovery efforts. Looking forward to the second half of 2022, we plan to build on the momentum gained during the second quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on slide 14. Union Pacific\u2019s earnings per share increased $0.21 to $2.93 and our quarterly operating ratio of 60.2% worsened by 510 basis points. Rapidly rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge program and the widening refining spreads negatively impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 130 basis points, while adding $0.18 to earnings per share. Our operating ratio and EPS were further negatively impacted 380 basis points and $0.02 per share, respectively, as core results reflect the impact of network recovery efforts that more than offset the benefits of our topline growth. Below the line real estate sales and lower state tax rates netted to a year-over-year benefit of $0.05 per share. We close the second half of a land sale with the Illinois Tollway Authority, which we announced in May and then the State of Nebraska changed its corporate tax rate in the quarter. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6.3 billion, up 14% versus 2021 on a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 25% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 11% in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $2.5 billion, a 1% increase versus last year. Interest expense increased 12% compared to 2021, reflecting higher debt levels. Income tax decrease 2% due to the Nebraska corporate tax rate reduction I just mentioned and contributing to lower second quarter effective tax rate. Net income of $1.8 billion, increased 2% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases resulted in earnings per share up 8% to $2.93. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, slide 16 provides the breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion, up 14% versus 2021. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue increased freight revenue 11.25 points reflecting the rise in diesel prices. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $976 million in the quarter. Strong pricing gains combined with the positive business mix drove 425 basis points of freight revenue growth, the significant decline in international intermodal volumes contributed positively to mix. However, the usually strong mix impact of year-over-year industrial growth was muted by strength in short-haul rock movements. Overall, the demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollar exceeding inflation dollars. It\u2019s important to note, though, that our network recovery efforts limited our upside for both price and mix as we only count price if we move the cars. Moving on to slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses where the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 89% on an 87% increase in fuel prices. We saw a dramatic rise in prices through the quarter, paying record highs is a surged from an average of $3.71 per gallon in April to $4.34 per gallon in June. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021, as negative productivity was partially offset by a more fuel efficient business mix. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. Second quarter workforce levels increased 2%. Management engineering and mechanical workforces grew 1%. While train and engine crews were up 5%, primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from, Eric, strong third quarter graduations position us to support our network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 5%, as a result of wage inflation and continued elevated costs relating to network inefficiencies that come in the form of higher recruit, overtime and borrow out costs. For the balance of the year, we expect year-over-year increases to be sequentially lower from the second quarter in both the third and fourth quarters. Purchase services and materials expense was up 30%, driven by higher cost to maintain, a larger active locomotive fleet inflation and volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our loop subsidiary. We also had an unfavorable comparison in the quarter versus 2021, where we called out a $35 million favorable one-time item. Equipment and other rents grew 15%, driven by lower TTX equity income and increased car higher expense related to network congestion. Other expense grew 17% in the quarter, driven by a $35 million increase in casualty expenses associated with adverse adjustments to older claims and increased business travel. For the full year we now expect other expense to be up low-single digits versus 2021. Although, fuel was clearly the driver of higher quarterly costs, the added expense from our service performance resulted in 69% fuel adjusted detrimental margins. Turning to slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2022 decreased slightly to just under $4.2 billion down 1%. Our cash flow conversion rate was 73% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion declined $727 million. This, of course, includes the impact of $455 million increase cash capital spending and $206 million in higher dividends. Capital spending year-to-date is up 38% versus 2021, which reflects both a more normalized spend trajectory and an increased capital budget for 2022. Year-to-date, we returned $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 10% dividend payout increase announced in May, the third such increase in a little over a year\u2019s time. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, as we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Wrapping up on slide 19, as we have discussed this morning, it was a difficult second quarter, but necessary to position ourselves for success in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are demonstrating greater network fluidity as evidenced by the metrics and Kenny just describe for you that there is still solid demand for our services, despite some indications of economic softening. For example, full year industrial production is still forecasted at nearly 5%, but back half 2022 estimates are weaker. Against that backdrop, we expect to be back on track to exceed industrial production in the second half of 2022 and produce full year carload growth of 4% to 5%. As it relates to our operating ratio, the first half performance makes achievement of year-over-year improvement unlikely. However, we do expect year-over-year improvement in the second half of 2022 and a full year operating ratio around 58%. Well, our 2022 results won\u2019t match our view coming into the year, we remain committed to our goal of ultimately achieving a 55% operating ratio. We are also revising our guidance for incremental margins, which we now expect to be around 50% for the back half of the year. Beyond 2022, we still expect to achieve our longer term guidance of mid-to-upper 60% incremental margins. Our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, capital spending at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue and we remain committed to leading the industry with our long-term dividend payout ratio and share repurchases on par with 2021. Finally, I feel fortunate to work with such a fantastic team of railroaders at Union Pacific. Every time I return from the field visit, I am energized about the future of our company. Thanks to a great team, we have a bright future ahead. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. Before my closing remarks, I want to briefly touch on a couple of topics. First, related to our sustainability efforts, we have made great progress to increase the use of renewable diesel and biodiesel in our locomotives. We are currently over 4% blended in our fuel usage and on target to achieve our interim goal of a 10% blend by 2025. This is a critical initiative for us to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Second is a quick update on the status of our labor negotiations. Earlier this week, President Biden appointed a Presidential Emergency Board and the Board\u2019s proceedings begin this coming Sunday in Washington D.C. All parties are anxious for a reasonable agreement. Our employees are long overdue for a wage increase. We are ready to put the uncertainty behind us and look forward to a resolution in the near future. Now wrapping up, as you heard from Eric, we have made positive strides on safety in the first half of the year. I am encouraged by the momentum that I see building within our safety programs. Having said that, we are short of our goal of world class performance and that is our task ahead. Our second quarter performance both operationally and financially did not reflect the best of Union Pacific, yet we still achieved quarterly financial records. This reflects the great work we have done through PSR adoption in the last several years to make our company more resilient, efficient and profitable. Our focus over the next six months is to again demonstrate our ability to successfully grow volumes, while improving and sustaining service levels. I am confident we will build that track record. These efforts are critical to our success in the back half of 2022 and beyond, and our core to our long-term strategy of serve, grow, win together. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR guidance. Back in early June, you made an adjustment and we are getting another adjustment today. So just curious what changed in the last month? Is this service related? Is it the economy maybe a little bit of both? And then just thinking about the quarterly cadence of the OR in the back half? Is there any color you can provide on how you are thinking 3Q plays out relative to 4Q? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Well, let me start, Jennifer, and then maybe you finish us up. So, Justin, clearly, as the quarter progressed and as we exited the quarter and came to the third quarter, there\u2019s a few headwinds that either continued or didn\u2019t debate as we would expected. So, one is, while we are recovering the network, we had anticipated the pace being a little quicker, and more importantly, we had anticipated volume coming on sooner as the network improved and getting the volume back is really the primary driver of improving our operating ratio and really shoring up the financials in total. In addition, fuel didn\u2019t behave kind of like what we had hoped it would and there were some other inflationary pressures that that added to it, but I\u2019d say those first points are the big points. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And then, I would also say, as we close out the quarter, you make some of those quarterly adjustments and you heard me reference that $35 million casualty change. That, obviously, is a pretty big swing factor. But things like that, as well as sequential improvements that we are seeing in our operations, that gives us the confidence in how we are thinking about the back half of the year to have that improvement, as we sequentially improve our operations, see volumes growth that\u2019s going to help us produce those stronger financial metrics in the back half of 2022. So I think that\u2019s an important way to think about it, Justin. Justin Long : Okay. And on the cadence in the back half, I guess, the guidance basically implies that you go from a 60 OR in the first half to something around a 56 in the second. Do you expect it to be pretty even 3Q to 4Q? Jennifer Hamann : There\u2019s different factors in both. Certainly, sequentially, as I mentioned, we are going to expect to improve, obviously, you get into the fourth quarter, you tend to see lighter volume and you maybe can get some weather. So, we will see exactly how that plays out. But what we are focused on is sequential improvement. You will see improvement in the third quarter from the second quarter. Certainly, I don\u2019t know that you will actually see year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. We think that\u2019s probably a little bit of a stretch. But certainly when you get to the fourth quarter, we are looking at year-over-year improvement, altogether, then to in the second half. Justin Long : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : You bet. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Justin. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. Just following along with in Justin\u2019s line of commentary, in terms of that incremental, it sounded like the volume piece was the bigger contributor. So I am just trying to understand between service and volume improvement, kind of what you need to see there to get that incremental margin in the back half. Just any more color there? Lance Fritz : Yeah. So I will start, Allison. What we need to see is exactly what we outlined earlier this morning and that is continued improvement in our service product, so that we can both spool up existing assets like green shuttles, which will generate more loads and very attractive loads in the green world, as well as bring on more assets that can get more loads for us, like coal sets or private cars or system cars. So, bottomline is, what we really need to pay attention to is, are we seeing car velocity improve, are we seeing excess inventory continue to exit the network and are we seeing our locomotive utilization and overall utilization of our assets improve, because that will generate basically what we need to have asset. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Which is more carloads to leverage against that asset. Lance Fritz : Correct. Yeah. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then just in line with that that volume, I know, Kenny said, there were sort of numbers of volume impact, obviously, from the metering. Any thought -- any way you can quantify what that impact was, so assuming that\u2019s going to come back online in a second half? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Allison, the way we look at it and think about it is, if you look at where we were in the first quarter, we were up, call it, 4%. We would have expected that sort of a run rate going into the second quarter. So if you had to frame it, you should frame it in that light. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask about, I think, purchase services costs would seem pretty elevated and I wonder if there is, were there kind of transitional costs, one-off type of costs, you would have good visibility to that improving in second half. Just maybe some thoughts on that and kind of how we think about network efficiency approving, affecting -- how we look at operating costs in second half? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Sure. Yeah. In terms of the purchase services, you are right, it was elevated. One thing to remember is, we did have a $35 million good guide last year. So that\u2019s part of that year-over-year comparison. But as we are bringing more of locomotives on, that, certainly there\u2019s a cost to maintain that larger fleet. You saw the locomotive productivity numbers that, Eric showed, so that really is an opportunity in the second half. And then also, when you think about our loop subsidiary and purchase transportation costs, we are seeing particularly the automotive business come back on, which is a big part of their business. That\u2019s where you see some of that purchase transportation flow through is in that purchase services line. Lance Fritz : Eric, maybe you want to, because I heard in Tom\u2019s question costs that existed in the second quarter and how they come out in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Absolutely. So picking up where Jennifer left off, the customer focus on most right now, they all relate to that gaining and the velocity that we have demonstrated in the second quarter. The opportunity we see in the immediate future is the locomotive side. If you look back in our first quarter earnings report, we had reported adding in about 150 locomotives. We have been working just in the last two weeks to start to reverse that and be very thoughtful about taking that out. We want to make sure that those get put into our add ready status, so that we can continue to adjust for variability, but also be able to meet the second half growth forecast. So that\u2019s a big opportunity for us, Lance. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Great. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Tom. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed you are your question. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to ask just a bigger picture question. I think, some people are questioning the success or maybe the sustainability of PSR. But if you look in 2Q, your headcount from pre-PSR is down 25%, 30%, volume is down about 7%? Is there some potential that you need to get that headcount back closer to those pre-PSR levels to get the service back? And I guess, I want to understand what you would think this means for the OR that we were supposed to do a 55 this year on our way to a lower -- low-to-mid 50s OR in a couple of years? Are those just the wrong numbers to be thinking about now for the OR overtime? Lance Fritz : Yes. Scott, let me start first by saying emphatically that PSR is not the cause of our problems in the second quarter. But when you look at our pre-transformation to today, the -- all of that headcount change is because we took work out of the network. We run one-third fewer trains, which require one-third fewer locomotives and also one-third fewer people running the trains and maintaining the locomotives. So we took work out of the network that didn\u2019t need to be there, because we were touching cars more than we needed to and we had too many special commodity unit trains running around the network. So we transformed the network took that out and we were in fine shape, were the same railroad that we were in 2021 or 2020. I mean. But here\u2019s where we got into trouble, we ran the network tight and we did not recognize the stack up of risks that were in front of us with COVID continuing to impact crew availability, growth coming on and normal weather events, when you run tight, you just don\u2019t have a lot of opportunity to recover quickly. We got into trouble and inventory grew on us, and we had to take some pretty significant measures to fix that and we did in the second quarter. When you look at what we need to do different going forward. It\u2019s not thousands of employees different. It\u2019s hundreds in different ways. We got to get our sports back. We got to run our Boards less tight than we were running them for a while. And we have got to do some other unique and creative things with our labor unions in order to make our crews more available and more productive without them working harder. That can be done. We see clear path for all of that. Eric Gehringer : But to the other part of your question about does that mean 55 is off the table? Absolutely not. We absolutely believe we have the opportunity to have that 55 OR as we restore our service, bring the volumes back on, as well as the incremental margin targets. So that does not change for us Scott 100%. Scott Group : Okay. Very helpful. And just, Lance, your comments were helpful. Do you think getting a labor deal done in the next couple of months is going to be a healthier? Lance Fritz : Yeah. What\u2019s going to be a help about that, Scott, is it takes off the table all the anxiety and conflict of a labor force that hasn\u2019t seen a raise in two and a half or three years. And you put that to bed and then we can get busy on deals that we care about on property, which are really, really important to us. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Jennifer, I just want to understand what\u2019s embedded in the back half guidance or the revised full year guidance, because this is now the second time in, I don\u2019t know, 40 days, 45 days that we are revising the full year outlook. And so I just think it would be helpful to understand, if we look at the back half guidance, how much implied service inflection is there, because Kenny and Eric\u2019s team have done a good job kind of addressing the biggest issues early in the quarter and we have seen a big bounce on service. And so, what I want to understand is, if we stay where we are off this improve level, is that enough to get to the back half guidance or embedded in that as a further improvement in service and car miles and things like that, if you can just address that, that would be helpful? Jennifer Hamann : Sure. So, two things, I mean, you are absolutely right, we have seen a very good rebound in terms of where we were, call it, from the middle of April to where we are today. So we are entering the third quarter in a much better posture than we entered the second quarter and feel good about that. But for us to be able to achieve these targets, we do need to continue to improve, and I think you have heard that from us, we need to continue to improve the fluidity of the network. That means using the assets more effectively, using our crew base better, getting more utilization out of a locomotives, you heard Eric, talk about that, those flow directly to the income statement, when you think about health and benefits, you think about our purchase services, but then we need the volume leverage on top of that. And so those are the things that we are looking at. You get those markers from us every week, so you will be able to track that progress. But we do need to improve from where we sit today to hit the second half targets. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Jennifer putting a final point\u2026 Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Lance Fritz : \u2026Amit. I think what we have talked about is, with the STB and others, we need to see that car velocity start with a 2 -- the 200 type number in the back half of the year, and with that, you will see most of the other metrics move in the right direction. Amit Mehrotra : Lance, just related to that, given how important it is to get to that 200 plus car mile velocity per day. There are a few people out there that have many decades of PSR experience that have seen PSR implemented in not just an upcycle but a down cycle and et cetera. Those guys seem to be available on a consultancy basis. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s scope to bring in somebody on a short-term basis to accelerate some of the progress that you have already made, or Eric\u2019s team has already made on the service levels. Is that something that you are considering or looking at doing? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Actually, Amit, we remain in conversation with all of the contacts that we have created through our PSR journey. And really, they are helpful, but we don\u2019t learn anything necessarily new, right? The issue is aggressively implementing the recovery plan, which we did through the second quarter, demonstrated the movement and keeping that movement up. So, yeah, fundamentally, the approach doesn\u2019t change and we have got the team that can make that happen. Amit Mehrotra : Sure. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Jennifer, and maybe, Lance, there\u2019s obviously some uncertainty as to what the actual Union wage increases from 2024 are ultimately going to be. Can you share how UP has managed that uncertainty with your accrued so far? And if actual wages were to come in different than those expectations, when do you true that up retroactively and communicate it to people like us prospectively? Lance Fritz : Jennifer, let me start by talking about wage increases and what we could see, and then you can kind of\u2026 Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Lance Fritz : \u2026 talk about how we have accrued, et cetera. So, Bascome, the PEB is going to listen to both sides and then come up with what they think is a reasonable approach to wages. Recall that our package is going to include 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. And in 2020 and 2021, the markets were tough for wages, right? And in 2020, wage growth was probably near zero. 2021 had accelerated, it\u2019s accelerating in 2022 and I\u2019d expect it probably going to be relatively strong in 2023 before dropping back down. So we have got a good beat on that. We have got a proposal that we will be talking to the PEB that reflects that and I think at the PEB is reasonable and they appear to be knowledgeable and skilled as arbitrators. We will get to a place that we are comfortable with. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Bascome, in terms of time, so once there\u2019s an agreement and we know what those numbers are, we will recognize anything that reflects the backward looking piece immediately if there is anything different there that we need to recognize. In terms of what we are accruing, we are obviously paying attention to the markets, the negotiations and we are keeping pace with that as we look to make those accrual. So we will true-up, if needed, at the time of the agreement. Bascome Majors : Sure. Thank you for both of that. Lance, just to double check here, it sounds like you are anticipating at least a proposal from the rails anticipating a lower inflation environment in 2021, maybe a higher one in 2022, 2023 and some normalization after that, is that reasonable to think your accruals would directionally reflect that? Lance Fritz : It\u2019s reasonable to think our proposal in front of PEB reflects that, for sure. Bascome Majors : Thank you both. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess as we are thinking about sort of the cadence of volume picking up in the back half of the year. So, obviously, it\u2019s related to service. But, yeah, maybe, Kenny, can we go through some of the segments where you maybe have good visibility to that if there are some incremental changes in the service product that you are offering, you can see a direct result from volume, because I think service has been improving here. I am not sure we have necessarily seen the commensurate improvement in the weekly carloads. Just want to get a sense of maybe some specific points where you feel like, yes, there\u2019s an opportunity coming here, we just need a little bit better product to be able to kind of serve the market? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Let\u2019s just walk you through all the markets here. If you look at our Bulk business, we talked about our grain business. We have had a couple good years on the grain side and clearly there is a lot of demand on the export side. So tough comparison versus last year in the fourth quarter, but the demand is there and we know that the crop is there also, which has given us a lot of confidence. On the coal side, you all see the same metrics that I see in terms of natural gas prices, those are going to be strong, for sure, throughout the rest of this year, probably, well, in 2023. On the fertilizer side, there\u2019s still a lot of demand on the export fertilizer side. And then, one of the things is I go to industrial and leave food and refrigerator, Eric and I have been working closely together to do in a second part of the quarter, add a few more of our system cars and here recently in July, we are adding a few more cars. And so as you look at places like metals, where we have win. If you look at some new business that we have coming on with industrial chemicals and plastics, even lumber is an area that and I know there\u2019s a lot of mixed media out there, but the demand is still pretty strong, that car supply will be there too. So you will look at that and then you transition over to our Premium area, where again, we have got a new private asset on our railroad and domestic intermodal will still be stable to strong. And then on the automotive side, dealer inventory still low. It is still at 25 days. And we expect and we have been talking a lot of our customers that they are going to get a better stronger supply of semiconductor chips and there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand there. So the way I look at it, I am very optimistic about the demand being there and our commercial team being able to win new business to bring it on. Lance Fritz : And Eric, it\u2019s all about running the network so that we can capture as much as possible. Eric Gehringer : Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right. And when you think about car velocity and you think about service, they are tied together. And so when we think about our biggest opportunity sitting right in front of us, it\u2019s really about crew availability and we have got some growing tailwinds, right? We have gotten through the third and fourth most impactful holiday of the year. Now that Father\u2019s Day and 4th of July is behind us, we saw a sequential improvement month-after-month during the entire quarter and our recruit rate that generates additional crews for our use. And then of course, we have got the hiring that I covered in my prepared comments that bring me a tremendous amount of confidence especially because 400 of the 500 that are currently in training will be available to us by the end of the third quarter. So all growing tailwinds to be able to increase velocity and deliver the service product that our customers expect. Chris Wetherbee : I appreciate that. Maybe one quick clarification, just international intermodal is are something that is sort of outside of your control in terms of whether its customers picking up at the port, warehouses having the wrong inventory is creating a logjam that\u2019s sort of creating some of the issues that we hear very publicly about that in terms of dwell on the dock in LA, Long Beach or something else going on there? Eric Gehringer : Sure. So let\u2019s back up and look at the entire supply chain on that. If you started the West ports and you are looking at their current total box count, clearly it\u2019s as high, if not higher than it was last year. Well, we are focused on besides just the West ports is the inland terminals. What you want to make sure you do is ensure that those inland terminals can remain fluid, right, thinking about Chicago, again, last year. We don\u2019t want to get to the point where we have got an excessive number of trains holding outside of Chicago. And to be clear, for this entire quarter, we haven\u2019t had that. We have remained fluid in Chicago. What\u2019s driving that is the increase chassis time, which turns into a lack of chassis to be able to generate back to the West Coast, to be able to keep the system entirely fluid. So as I look at the network right now, we are prioritizing correctly so for our customers fluidity inside of our intermodal terminal and we need continued improvement on external factors to keep driving the entire supply chain to get better. But, Kenny, you may want to add something? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Just you and your team are doing a great job of controlling what you can control. We don\u2019t have control over their international chassis. And so we are working with our customers to make sure that they can get as much efficiency from their own chassis beat as possible. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I want to focus on back on the metering and embargoing traffic and I know your Eastern peer yesterday quantified that as kind of a measure of last resort and very extreme in nature. And my question, I guess is, whether are you being more impacted than your peers from structural -- the structural change -- occurrence of the supply chain issues. And perhaps if you can characterize that relative to your closest peer BNSF, they are going to kind of a similar experience. What I am trying to assess here is, the potential for shear loss once things moderate, and obviously, there\u2019s some customer dislocation here and whether when things moderate, that will come back to bite you at all, I know, CPKC is going to bring on new competition next year as well. So any color on where you stand relative to your peers and whether you feel that your return to a better service is matching that of your peers lagging or are you coming ahead of that those your peers in terms of that recovery? Lance Fritz : Yeah. So, Walter, you can see the data for yourself. Our recovery since April has led the peer group, the US Railroads, certainly, its lead in the West. So our statistics would tell you that we are recovering and I am sure all of our peers are working hard to recover as well and we are not dissatisfied with our pace at this point. In terms of how we use embargoes, we -- it\u2019s evident, if you look at the STB, we use embargoes more than our peer railroads do. And the way we use them is very targeted to a particular destination receiver that is not controlling their inbound volumes. And when our serving yard for that receiver indicates that we have got way more inventory both in route and on hand, then they can handle in a reasonable period of time. That\u2019s when we use embargo. So we use it more than our peers do. I am not sure why they don\u2019t. But it\u2019s a very effective tool for that purpose. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I mean, you hit it on the head, Lance. I just want to first start off by saying we make unilateral decisions about how we approach the customers and so we are not looking at what someone is doing in the East or the West. And I got to thank our customers, they were right there with us during our process to work through meter in the traffic. Eric, you and your team did a really good job of us working together, providing customers with quantifiable data for where we thought they should be for getting the excess inventory out of line. Those conversations, I don\u2019t want to downplay it, they weren\u2019t -- that some of them were difficult. I think the tail-tail for us are the results. We have had some really strong wins coming out of RFPs, bid, competitive bids, where we have won incremental business. So when we look at it that way, some of the same customers that we had to have these difficult conversations with, we have turned those into positives and incremental bind. So that tells you that, again, we have a really focused and deliberate approach with our customers. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Very encouraging. Appreciate that color. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Walter. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Eric, you mentioned that the hiring trends are up, wanted to hear a little bit more about retention. We have seen just recently a couple of announcements from the East, bumping up the pay for, I guess, new contractors there or new conductors there that are getting qualified. So is that something that you can similarly do or looking at doing. And then for, Kenny, maybe one more thing in the bucket of things you can\u2019t control? Can you just talk more broadly about AB5 and whether or not that\u2019s going to have some sort of impact on the port\u2019s supply chains and if that affects your IMC partners in any way, if that does end up getting implemented? Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Brian, I will start. Thanks for that question. As you know, our goal this year in total was to bring on 1,400 transportation employees, and as I said, in my prepared comments, we are well on our way to do that. Specific to your comment around, are you seeing increased retention issues or wash outs? We are really not. Both of our rates would be in line with our historical performance. Now, we have done a number of different things around the hiring that\u2019s helped to ensure that that\u2019s the case when we went back and you look at the beginning of the year with some of the changes we made to our training program that in some cases extended parts of it, that was to ensure that the quality of the training program was exactly what our employees needed. At the same time, even just in the last two weeks, we have offered up a new program, were for our new hires, we are actually engaging them to see if they actually want to go work in other locations and they may have otherwise been hired on and that\u2019s providing flexibility that historically we may not have. So we continue to challenge ourselves between the operating team and our workforce resources group to incentivize our new hires to stay with us. We want them to be that 30 year plus employees that we have got across the entire system. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So on your question about AB5, I\u2019d say it\u2019s just too soon right now, and it\u2019s a little unclear on the impact. And you are right on, we have been talking to a number of our IMCs out there, and they are seeing the same thing. I mean, a few of them have some of these owner operators, contractors, but it\u2019s just too soon and a little bit unclear to see what that impact will be. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, guys. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Brian. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, I think, at the beginning of this year, there was a lot of optimism on the intermodal side, adding Swift, adding Schneider next year, improved supply chain, tight truck market, et cetera. As you think about on-boarding Schneider next year and combining that with some of the service issues we have spoken about and the recovery plan? Do you feel that you are appropriately resourced to meet the growth targets that you were expecting by on-boarding these two huge customers and given some of the macro dynamics that should be supportive to intermodal or do you need to scale back some of your expectations in the medium term? Kenny Rocker : No. I mean I want to start off by saying that the management team here has really done a great job of being deliberate about our capital expenditures. We have talked about the $600 million that\u2019s going to help us with additional rail sidings with commercial facilities. And I do want to say that this will help all of our intermodal network. So, yes, we are excited about Schneider coming on, but we have got a strong stable when you look at Hub, Knight-Swift and XPO, and some of the IMCs that we have. All of them, the entire network will benefit from it. Eric and I and our teams are just we have got a really rigorous process, planning process and we feel good about the investments that we are making and the ability to onboard those new customers and actually grow with the existing customers. Eric Gehringer : Yeah. I will echo the exact same confidence. As you think about what the operating department and the marketing sales department are doing together, the last six months of Knight-Swift, which has gone exceptionally well, that\u2019s our continued playbook with Schneider. We are making sure that we take every one of those plays and applying them to Schneider. I will also echo Kenny\u2019s comment about how we think about investment. Kenny, you hit on the infrastructure. We are also doing a lot on the technology side and it doesn\u2019t just benefit Schneider. It benefits all of our customers. If you think about the work just in the last month, we are now through our UP Go app, we are getting about 10,000 comments back from drivers on our intermodal ramps. Those comments range from ideas to improve, to things that they think are going really well. It\u2019s that type of feedback that we can continue to ensure that we are making our ramps as efficient as possible from a driver\u2019s experience for all of our customers. So I am very excited, very confident. Jon Chappell : Okay. Thank you, Eric. Thanks, Kenny. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Great. Good morning. Maybe it seems like some momentum you talked about in the latter part of the quarter. But Kenny, volumes are up 1% quarter to-date here, almost one month through the quarter and with about 1% average growth in the first half of the year, just to get to the 4% to 5% growth, Jen, was talking about, it seems like you would have to quickly ramp to upper single digits, especially given the trend of nearly one-third of the quarter in the bag? So, maybe, Kenny, you also mentioned the drop in spot rates in trucking. Maybe could you just revisit that for a bit and maybe walk us through where we should see that rapid ramp? And then, Lance, from your perspective in your seat, I mean, I guess, we are kind of even something that some of us haven\u2019t seen with inflationary backdrop that hasn\u2019t been around for 40 years. How do you think about that in terms of managing the rail and how to adjust? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. First off, and Eric talked a little bit about this coming out of a 4th of July holiday certainly puts us in a ramp-up capacity or ramp-up scenario. The other part of that is, and I mentioned this is that, we are adding more resources, meaning we are adding in more of the system cars onto our network and so that\u2019s given us a lot more confidence there. And then you mentioned the spot rates and we have got to differentiate the spot rates that we have seen go down versus these contracted rates. We still see if there is a firmness in those contracted rates and there\u2019s a lot to that and a lot of reasons looming. There\u2019s still a number of truckers that need to be hire and that\u2019s in the tens of thousands. We have seen chassis dwell increase. We have seen container dwell increase. So there\u2019s still tightness there. And as our service is improving, we are going to be pricing and we are pricing right now for that in service improvement, especially during all the tightness that we are seeing. Lance Fritz : Ken, and fundamentally, you are right, we do need to accelerate volumes into the third quarter and we will. We are confident that that will be happening and is starting. In terms of inflation, also correct, it\u2019s a unique environment, right, when you start seeing CPI in the 9% plus range. It\u2019s been a long, long time since we have seen that and probably most of our management team up and down the org chart hasn\u2019t experienced that before. What we are dealing -- what we are doing to deal with that is just being relentless on productivity and efficiency. Notwithstanding what you saw in the second quarter, which was all about recovery and adding the necessary resources and experiencing the necessary costs to recover more quickly than we would otherwise. But overarching that, there\u2019s just a relentless use of technology and process improvement to get productivity out of the network. And one of the things that\u2019s helping us directly with purchased inflation is the Wave process that our supply chain team goes through. We are on our -- I want to say, Wave 11 right now where we take a chunk of our spend and basically deconstruct it with should cost analysis or benchmark analysis and then negotiate with our primary suppliers and looking for new suppliers that can help us find cost reduction, total cost of ownership. And that saved us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars over the last handful of years, and that\u2019s cumulative as we look forward. So, yeah, you do have to do different things Ken, and it\u2019s a unique environment, right? And it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to go away anytime soon. Ken Hoexter : Lance, if I could just clarify one thing, I guess, through this call. It\u2019s not just, I guess, from a UP perspective, this is not just about employees as we heard about last night from an Eastern Rail. I guess you still see this as a lot of operational improvement that you control, and I guess, from Eric\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s not just about adding headcount. Is it -- am I hearing that right? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Ken, I think, you are hearing it mostly right. Primarily, we do have to get crew availability, which is about hiring and hiring in the right spot to get back to being completely fluid. So that\u2019s an important element. In addition to that, though, you can see in our metrics, terminals are in generally pretty good shape. Terminal dwell is good and there\u2019s, portions of the network that are operating pretty darn well. We have got to get over-the-road more effectively that starts with crew availability, but there are other things that are built into that that can help like continuing to reduce variability events and derailments, things like that. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the time. Appreciate the time. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Ken. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks, Operator. Lance and team, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more on the domestic intermodal side. You mentioned, Kenny, I think that, you are keeping a close eye on sort of declining spot truckload rates and maybe the impacts it might have on domestic intermodal. How should we think about the yields in the back half of the year as we look at the model? Kenny Rocker : Well, we are 80% through our RFP season and so the prices and increases that we have taken, you are going to see those reflect as the volume improved in domestic intermodal. Again, yeah, we are going to watch it, but it\u2019s just not showing up right now on the contracted side. It\u2019s still a very tight supply chain. We would like to see a few things loosen up in terms of the chassis dwell that\u2019s out there and the container dwell to help with the volume and us capture more of that volume that\u2019s out there. But, again, there\u2019s still a disconnect there between what we are seeing on the spot side and the contractual rates. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, I mean, that\u2019s just reflective of the fact that, in our contracted world, we chase pricing different than you see the rapid price changes in truck. So that while truck spot rates flew up and are now starting to drop back down, we are still in the kind of the catch-up phase, if you will. Jason Seidl : And as we look at 4Q, last 4Q, we were sure that the height or the height of the worry about the supply chain, there was probably lot of accessorial charges that a lot of different carriers on the rail or trucking side was adding on. How should we think about that this year as we look to the year-over-year comparisons for 4Q yield in general? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Jason, I mean, you are right. We had seen some elevation in some of those ancillary revenue items because of supply chain. And as we talked kind of at the beginning of the year, and I would say we still see this today there\u2019s opportunities for that to improve in the back half of the year, assuming the supply chain improves as well. So we are watching that, it hasn\u2019t changed much, I would say here in the first half, but would look for some improvement in the back half. I should also mention relative to yields in the back half, we are expecting a little bit more of a negative mix impact in the back half as we see those international and domestic intermodal loadings to pick up relative to some of the rest of the business group, so something else to consider. Lance Fritz : And all of that\u2019s embedded in. Jennifer Hamann : Oh! Yeah. Absolutely. And that\u2019s consistent with how we kind of saw the year playing out relative to mix even back in January. Jason Seidl : Okay. Appreciate the color everyone. Thank you for the time. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Jason. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yeah. Thanks. So, when you talk about certainly the carload growth in the back half of the year, but then, Kenny, I think, you also said that you are expecting incremental growth in 2023. Just curious what kind of broader macroeconomic assumptions that takes into account and really is it -- are you able to just sort of play catch up on the carload side, even if the broader macroeconomic environment were to decline a little bit or how sensitive would that growth be? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I mean a lot of this is not being able to catch up with mixed volume. I mean they are probably some low inventories that we will replenish on the coal side. But, again, the fundamentals for natural gas prices, we expect to remain pretty strong in 2023. The same is true with some of the commodities like finished vehicles and auto parts, but layered on all of these are really business development wins. So I can point to business development wins on finished vehicles that were over-the-road, business development wins on auto parts that were over-the-road. And then, again, same is true with our plastics business and our metals business. These are new business wins that are coming on. So that\u2019s how I think about it when I am looking at industrial production as a whole and where we stand and what\u2019s out there for us to capture. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Ben, regarding kind of what could happen in a recession. I have been talking about a lot of our customers across the different markets and those that are big multinationals and global. Their overall outlook is clouded by the fact that Europe is definitely slowing down pretty dramatically. China is in a bad place right now and they look to the United States markets and they think that hasn\u2019t happened in the U.S. yet. And the impact in commodities that we ship, if a downturn were to occur, might not be as strong as it would be otherwise in a recession, because in recessions in commodities, you get this bullwhip effect, right, where there\u2019s not just in demand destruction, there\u2019s destocking that occurs. A lot of our markets, there\u2019s not destocking to occur, because they are still trying to catch-up on their supply chain stocking issues. So it\u2019s just hard to say, Ben. We have been really trying to parse that out ourselves. And so far, we think that if the U.S. economy slows down, let\u2019s say, it is slowing down. I think our markets are going to be in a place where we are still going to have growth opportunity. Kenny Rocker : Absolutely. Ben Nolan : All right. That\u2019s tremendous help. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up here on the domestic intermodal commentary, look, I think, I should completely hear you on the yield difference between you and the truck spot market. But I think the broad consensus, including from trucking companies is that the truck market is loosening here and well into the back half of the year? So when you said earlier that some of these IMC switches between you and your primary competitor are going to be good for everyone. That implies the potential for significant truckload conversion in the back half of the year, kind of what drives that uptick in truck conversion, the time when truck rates really should be falling in the back half? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So, remember, we do have a new customer that we are excited about that\u2019s on our property now with Knight-Swift, and we are seeing benefits and wins from there. As our service product improves, we also expect to insert more resources out there to win over-the-road. We also know that there\u2019s over-the-road business that can come back to us on the parcel side. So, again, if you look across the spectrum, there\u2019s still opportunities out there as our service improves, as we add a few more of those resources into the network to grow this business in the second half. Jennifer Hamann : And I think the other thing, Ravi, just to remember is, there\u2019s a big fuel delta between rail and trucks. And so, certainly, fuel has an impact on our margins, but it has an even larger impact in terms of that cost for people who are shipping by truck. And then, longer term, there\u2019s the ESG benefits that you have heard us talk about. And so, while that\u2019s maybe not shifting the needle much today, longer term we still think that\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. Lance Fritz : Right. But going back to your question, Ravi, I am not sure, Kenny, that\u2026 Kenny Rocker : Right. Lance Fritz : \u2026 your requirements in the back half is some kind of rapid acceleration in truck conversion. You just keep on the path you are on, we get our service product continuing to improve and what we need to have happened is happening. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thanks for the color. And just got one quick follow-up, Lance, I think, there\u2019s some chatter about Congress trying to mandate one person crews for the railroads, kind of any comment on that? Lance Fritz : Yeah. So I don\u2019t know if Congress is getting involved. They frequently get asked to get involved in the crew size discussion. Our role right now inside of national negotiation is to make sure that either the PEB addresses the question or they address the question by allowing the railroads and labor to continue to negotiate, which we are right now with our unions that are affected on redeploying the conductor from the cab to the ground. We think it\u2019s better for the conductor\u2019s quality of life. They will be great jobs. And of course, there is an efficiency opportunity there. And so we are going to keep pursuing that. So, yes, stay tuned. I think the next big thing that will happen is the STB is pending a rule that they have been working on regarding how many people have to be in the cab of locomotive and we have got our antenna up on that. Jennifer Hamann : I think you mean FRA. Lance Fritz : FRA, excuse me. Did I say STB? I am sorry. I meant the FRA. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thanks, everyone. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. This may be a little redundant. You have probably answered it multiple parts. But in terms of the volume acceleration to sort of high single-digit in the back half of the year? I am just -- to go from basically 1% to that. Just trying to get a sense for how quick volumes can react. And I guess the question is, I know you have opportunity besides the economy and headcount is important? But when you think about altogether, whether it be the economy, headcount, operational changes, what has to happen like first and today in order to be able to get that acceleration to the level that you expect? Because all the things together seem like they need to happen. But I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a big ramp and I am just trying to understand which is the most critical components to it? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Sure. Jordan, this is Lance. So I will take you back as recently as June, where you saw seven-day carloads at the beginning of the month in the high 150s, 160 ballpark in the month at 165, 166. So that kind of ramp can happen, will happen, does happen on the railroad and we are capable of it. We just did it. By the way, during June, our service product was improving through that whole month. So we grew and improved service at the same time. In terms of what makes that happen, number one, we have to have crew availability so we can run trains on demand. That\u2019s not just cruise being graduated, which they are every week right now, but it\u2019s also making sure our re-crew rates in the right place and that we are using every crew wisely and that\u2019s in the right place. Our re-crew rates down, first starts are much more efficient. There\u2019s still a lot of room to run on both of those. So that\u2019s the first thing that has to happen. And then after that, it\u2019s all the pick and shovel work of running a much better network from a reliability and a variability perspective. Right now, the good points are terminals are in good shape. We are launching on time on average, all of our network and what we have to do now is get over-the-road better and that\u2019s really about crew availability and variability. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. I appreciate you squeezing me in. It\u2019s been a long call, so I will be quick. You noted that you had jumped on hiring and raising your T&E employee training a little sooner, I think, than some other rails. CSX was griping last night about how they are having attrition issues after training. Norfolk just put a release this morning saying they are raising pay to $25 an hour and adding incentives? When I talk to rail industry people that are hiring, they say, this is Gen Z. They don\u2019t want to work five days a week. They don\u2019t want to be on call before going out in the field. Can you talk a little bit about how the job is changing or what you have done to be maybe a little more successful in hiring and retaining your employees than some of the stories we are hearing? Eric Gehringer : Sure. Jeff, let me take that one. And I just want to make sure we level set on kind of your opening. So we started hiring back in April of last year. We hired approximately about 250 transportation employees, as well as mechanical engineering last year. And then we have built on that success this year. And as I reported this morning, we remain extremely confident that we can hire the 1,400 transportation employees we need to. Now as part of the job, I am going to tell you that, I think we are about halfway through that journey. Certainly, the last two years to three years, as we have looked at how, do you attract people to the railroad, we have relied on things that have proven to work in the past. So our implementation of an employee referral program, making sure that we are getting the word out inside of our own families and friends, because those people best understand what the railroad really asks of you. They come in day one, understanding those expectations. At the same time, our Workforce Resource Group has done a phenomenal job being in different technical colleges to continue to draw upon people from there with different scholarships. But they are also inside of that, helping to achieve our goals for minority and for women joining the railroad. Now here\u2019s what\u2019s left, right? What\u2019s left, Lance hit on part of it that certain jobs today, if you can take them from a relatively unscheduled process or unscheduled nonstandard schedule and move them to a more standard schedule. Year one, going to improve the retention of the employees you have now. And two, you are going to offer up jobs that have been different than in the past and in doing so, you are going to attract different groups of people than you may have been able to attract in the past. So that\u2019s the work we have in front of us, even just two weeks ago, we launched a new survey in all of our transportation employees to help them further help us understand our quality of life on the job. So you will continue to see us focus on it. We are not struggling as much as maybe some other roads as you characterized it, but it\u2019s still an opportunity we have to keep at the forefront of us. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the time. Lance and Kenny a bigger picture question for you on intermodal. You guys have put forward service recovery plans to the STB that are targeting kind of return to low 60s, I think, on-time performance in the intermodal business. I wanted to get a sense from you guys, why is that the right number? It seems like a fairly, I don\u2019t know, not a particularly aspirational set of targets. And is there a way that you guys can be thinking about that business differently that would give you may be a better advantage in terms of accelerating the modal shift off the highway and on the rail? Lance Fritz : That\u2019s a great question, David. And, clearly, what we have got in our service recovery plan with the STB is not our ultimate end game and so the number that you are referencing for intermodal trip plan compliance isn\u2019t the aspirational end game. Ultimately, in the current environment, when that number is in the mid-80s to high 80s, low 90s, it\u2019s awesome. And where we are right now in the low-to-mid 60s needs work, right? We need improvement. Now having said that, ultimately, what every customer tells us, what they really care about, just do what you say you are going to do. I can adjust. And that\u2019s really what they want from us. So what we are trying to give them right now is markers that they can trust as we move through the back half of the year and use us and use our intermodal product to satisfy their needs, right? We are still -- we can do huge volume at very competitive pricing compared to the alternative mode of truck and we can do it reliably so long as we continue to improve our service product and promise something that we can actually deliver. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : All I will add is that we are always looking at our customer success metrics. We talk about it often, we engage our customers and that could continue to evolve. David Vernon : I mean it strikes me as during some of these questions and service reviews with the STB and customers complaining about service, there\u2019s a big disparity around the definition of what rail services. And I mean, as you guys think about how you approach that business and how you contract with customers, is there something that you guys can do to better clarify kind of what that service level would be and maybe even use pricing to incentivize it, because it does occur to me that there is a large customer in UPS that does get good service, obviously, they pay for it. But most other customers that are complaining about things like service, the ambiguity around what is service and that matching of price for service doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s maybe as tight as it could be. Is that something you guys are working on or thinking about at all? Lance Fritz : Yeah. We absolutely price for the product that we are providing to the customer base. We have got plenty of room to run there to continue doing that, as you point out, more effectively. And the other thing that you are pointing out is process and we are working really hard right now on business process between ourselves and our customers to be crystal clear on what the service product is and what we can do and how much we can do and then helping customers manage their business around that and managing our business around that as we continue to grow and improve our product. So, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of work around that, David, right now. David Vernon : All right. Thanks guys. I will follow-up couple more follows-ups there. Thanks. Lance Fritz : Thank you. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question. Jairam Nathan : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up on a few questions that you already answered regarding recessionary and plans there. So I think in the past your interest figure has been pretty nimble in cutting costs in the event of a volume decline. But do you foresee any changes to how you can adjust your labor given the difficulties that you had this year to kind of to get crew availability up. Do you see a different approach in the event of a recession or a volume downturn? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Jairam, fundamentally the answer is no. We still -- if there were a catastrophic downturn in the industrial economy, the goods economy, we would adjust very quickly to it. Now having said that, on the margin, like we talked about very early in the call, we would be much more thoughtful about where and how much and how we would make those employees available to us when volume returned. So you would probably see marginally some different behavior, but fundamentally, we have the ability and it\u2019s proven to adjust our business to whatever the environment is. Jairam Nathan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Jairam. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Yeah. And thank you again, Rob, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. We appreciate the Q&A with you. We look forward to talking with you again in October to discuss our third quarter results. Until then take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before discussing results for the quarter, I want to thank our employees for their tireless efforts over the past several months to improve service levels. I'd also note the dedicated service of our craft professionals throughout the recent very lengthy labor negotiation. The new agreements based on the Presidential Emergency Board recommendations reward our employees for their hard work. And with roughly half of our unions ratifying agreements, we are looking forward to complete this process and move forward. Now turning to our third quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. These results include the impact of a $114 million charge for prior period estimates related to the new labor agreements. Excluding that charge, adjusted net income is $2 billion or $3.19 per share. This compares to third quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.57 per share. Our adjusted third quarter operating ratio of 58.2% is 190 basis points higher than 2021. Costs related to higher inflation and ongoing network inefficiencies were offset by fuel surcharge revenue, volume growth and strong core pricing gains to produce adjusted operating income growth of 13%. We made real progress during the quarter to increase network fluidity and better meet customer demand. And as you'll hear from the team, we're continuing to take steps in the fourth quarter to better meet that demand and drive costs from the network. While the year hasn't played out as originally planned, our volumes have outpaced our peers, demonstrating the growth mindset that we're instilling within our organization. So with that, let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Third quarter volume was up 3% compared to a year ago as carloads increased across all three of our business segments. Although overall volume was up, we undoubtedly had left demand on the table as we continue to improve service across the network. Freight revenue was up 18% driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong pricing gains. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to last year driven by a 14% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was up 2% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 5% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products volume was up 3% with strong domestic feed grain and increased biofuel shipments for renewable diesel. Fertilizer carloads were down 7% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of export and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 15% for the quarter driven by a 4% increase in volume and an 11% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 3% compared to 2021 driven by pure petroleum shipments primarily due to regulatory changes in the Mexico market. Volumes for forest products was down 2% year-over-year primarily driven by lower demand for corrugated boxes. This was partially offset by positive year-over-year lumber shipments. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 8% compared to 2021 due to new business wins, customer expansion and market demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 7% compared to last year primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments, growth in construction materials and metals business development. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 25% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 21% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 19% driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment. Finished vehicles increased by 33%, and auto parts increased by 11% against a softer comparison from last year. Intermodal volume was flat. Domestic intermodal was down 3% due to softening demand driven by a 16% decline in parcel shipments. However, international volume strengthened by 4% from ocean carriers shifting more freight to inland terminals. Now moving to our outlook for the rest of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But here is where we sit today with our markets. Let's start out with our bulk commodities. We expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to generate demand for both domestic and export shipments. However, the opportunity to capture demand is dependent on the available resources. And our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery. But as we've mentioned before, we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter as exports were strong last year. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for industrial production is decelerating, and demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect construction to be a positive due to strong project demand in the south. And lastly, for premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand as spot truck rates fall and inventories climb. We expect parcel and truckload demand to remain soft as consumer preferences have shifted more to experiences versus goods. We're also watching the international markets closely, but we expect to be positive in the fourth quarter due to easier comps. And we expect growth in Automotive to be driven by improving supply for parts and inventory replenishment. Overall, we still foresee a favorable demand environment for the fourth quarter. Crew availability continues to improve, which will help us capture more growth and support our business development wins as we head into 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9. Our year-to-date safety results are demonstrating meaningful and sustained improvement compared to 2021. Safety impacts every facet of our business : our employees, our customers and our shareholders. While our safety management system is promoting the right culture, our #1 priority remains returning every employee home safely at the end of the day. Taking a look at our current network performance on Slide 10. Our operating metrics steadily improved through the third quarter, aided by improving crew availability from hiring initiatives, lower recrew rates and improved crew utilization. Our hiring and training pipeline is strong. To date, we have graduated 890 employees and have an additional 518 currently in training, all expected to graduate by January of 2023. We have now hired 1,408 new transportation employees, exceeding our goal for the year. Freight car velocity is approaching 200 miles per day, up from its low in April. Even more encouraging, the improvement came while moving 10,000 more weekly carloads. By utilizing approximately 250 borrowed out employees and adding new graduates to some of our challenged crew locations, we have been able to add more coal and grain sets back into the network. We also reduced our recrew rates from a peak of 11% in April to now around 7%. Exiting the third quarter, the network is in a more solid and fluid state than earlier in the year. Going forward, we are building upon these improved results to drive excess cost from the network. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11, which remained challenged when compared to 2021 even considering the relatively easy comparison from last year's wildfire and weather events. However, both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance strengthened sequentially from last quarter's results. Intermodal trip plan compliance was flat sequentially and remains impacted by persistent supply chain challenges, resulting in elevated chassis street times and container ramp to well. We continue to make progress at the West Coast ports as the number of stacked containers decline. Turning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. During the third quarter, as performance improved, we were able to remove and stage locomotives across the network to improve overall fleet utilization. As a result, locomotive productivity did improve sequentially although remains below last year's metric. Entering the fourth quarter, as we continue to improve train speed and other measures, locomotive productivity will continue to strengthen as well. Third quarter workforce productivity was flat as both the labor force and car miles increased. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2021 as the team utilized longer trains to handle increasing volumes. We now anticipate completing an additional four sidings in 2022 on top of the 20 sidings in our original plan. This will bring the total sidings completed since 2019 to 80. These sidings are a key enabler of our ability to effectively use our resources and drive productivity. Wrapping up on Slide 13. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made, but our work is not yet done. Using our PSR principles, we will further improve our service product and build a more resilient network. Our trajectory to this point reflects the great team we have at Union Pacific, and my thanks goes out to everyone for their efforts and dedication. To finish 2022, we remain focused on further reducing excess inventory, safely improving operational efficiency and using our crews and locomotives even more effectively. Ultimately, as is always the goal, we need to run the network and manage our assets in a more than volume variable manner. To that point, we are storing excess international intermodal well cars as the expected levels of volume did not materialize while at the same time, to capture demand in other areas, we are bringing cars out of storage. Additionally, to support bulk demand, we will continue hiring programs and send additional borrowed-out employees to crew-challenged locations in our northern region. As we wrap up the year and I look forward, I am confident that the foundation we are building will provide a better service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 15 with a walk down of our third quarter operating ratio and earnings per share. Our reported operating ratio of 59.9% and earnings per share of $3.05 includes a $114 million change in estimate related to the Presidential Emergency Board recommendation and subsequent ratified and tentative labor agreements. At a high level, the $114 million charge negatively impacted third quarter operating ratio by 170 basis points and reduced EPS by $0.14. For more granular information on the charge, please refer to the appendix slide at the back of the presentation deck. It's important to note, however, that while our general wage accruals weren't far off the PEB recommendation, we did not accrue for the [$1,000] annual bonus payments. Core results in the quarter continue to reflect inflation and network inefficiencies as our operating ratio was unfavorably impacted 310 basis points but contributed $0.20 to EPS. Importantly, we did make sequential core improvement in our operating ratio of 40 basis points versus the second quarter. Decreasing fuel prices in the quarter and the roughly two-month lag in our fuel surcharge program favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 70 basis points and added $0.37 to EPS.  Finally, third quarter results also include the favorable comparison to last year's weather and wildfire events, which adds 50 basis points to OR and $0.05 to EPS. Looking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 16, where we provide both reported and adjusted numbers that exclude the impact of the labor charge. Throughout my remarks, I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $6.6 billion, up 18% versus 2021 on 3% year-over-year volume growth. As we have seen throughout the year, higher fuel prices are the primary contributor to higher operating expenses, which increased 22% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, our expenses were up 10% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted operating income totaled $2.7 billion, a 13% increase versus 2021. Other income increased $86 million driven by higher real estate income, including a $35 million gain on sale and pension benefit. Income tax expense increased 13% as a result of higher pretax income, partially offset by corporate income tax rate reductions in three of our operating states. As a result of those changes, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 23%. Adjusted net income of $2 billion increased 18% versus 2021, and adjusted earnings per share was up 24% to $3.19. Operating revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share were all quarterly records. Looking more closely at third quarter freight revenue, Slide 17 provides a breakdown, which totaled $6.1 billion, up 18% versus 2021. Year-over-year volume gains, supported by our business development efforts and sequentially improving operational fluidity, increased freight revenue 325 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue impacted revenue 13 points, reflecting the impact of higher year-over-year diesel prices and the two-month lag in our recovery program. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter. Strong pricing gains when combined with a slightly negative business mix drove 200 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower petroleum shipments, combined with higher rock and auto part shipments, contributed to the negative mix. From a price standpoint, we have now lapped the positive benefit from coal contracts indexed to natural gas prices. So the year-over-year benefit is minimal. And as we experienced in the second quarter, network fluidity limited the upside for both price and mix. Setting these headwinds aside, we are confident that we will yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars even with a higher inflationary hurdle than expected at the start of the year. Moving on to Slide 18, which provides a summary of our third quarter adjusted operating expenses where the primary driver again this quarter was fuel, up 71% on a 67% increase in fuel prices. While we saw fuel prices come down some in the quarter, our average quarterly fuel price was $3.96 per gallon, only $0.07 lower than second quarter's average price. Our fuel consumption rate achieved an all-time quarterly record in the quarter, improving 1% versus 2021 as a result of productivity gains and a more fuel-efficient business mix. Looking closer at the other expense lines, adjusted compensation and benefits expense was up 12% versus 2021. This includes an additional $19 million related to this quarter's accrual for wage increases and annual bonus. Total third quarter workforce levels increased 3%. Management, engineering and mechanical workforces grew 3%, while train and engine crews were up 5% primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from Eric, we have now exceeded our 2022 hiring goals. Cost per employee came in higher than anticipated, up 8% primarily driven by wage inflation. We also experienced continued cost pressures related to network inefficiencies with higher overtime and borrow-out costs. For the fourth quarter, we expect the year-over-year increase to be around 7%, in line with tentative and ratified wage increases. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 23% driven by higher cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loup subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents decreased 1% driven by higher equity income that more than offset increased car hire expenses. Other expense grew 18% in the quarter, a bit higher than we anticipated as a result of increased casualty expenses associated with freight loss and damage and personal injury. For the fourth quarter, we expect other expense to be flat versus 2021 as we are anticipating the receipt of an insurance settlement for last year's bridge fire. Overall, inflation and cost inefficiencies offset the benefits of volume leverage and resulted in fuel-adjusted incremental margins of just 2%. Although not the results we know we can achieve, it still reflects positive progress from the second quarter and provides us with momentum as we wrap up 2022. Turning to Slide 19 and our cash flows. Cash from operations through the third quarter increased 9% to $7.1 billion. Our comparable cash flow conversion rate was 80%, and free cash flow totaled $2.1 billion. Although this is a decrease of $517 million versus 2021, it includes $745 million of increased cash capital spending and $317 million in higher dividends. With the increased capital spending to date, we now expect full year 2022 capital to be around $3.4 billion, up slightly from our prior guidance, but well within our overall guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Year-to-date, shareholders have received $7.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This level of cash returns demonstrates our firm commitment to rewarding shareholders with strong returns. Related to share repurchases, we now expect to buy back roughly $6.5 billion in 2022. Although we repurchased shares at a strong pace in the third quarter and expect that to continue for the remainder of the year, we have been impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures and service costs. Lastly, we finished the third quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. In fact, during the quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's to A3, and we are now A-rated across all 3 credit agencies. Also during the quarter, we issued $1.9 billion in debt, which included $600 million of green bonds, our first such issuance. Wrapping up on Slide 20. With a little over two months left in the year, we are focused on building upon the positive momentum of the third quarter. The operating team is executing on its plan to improve operating performance and capture additional unmet customer demand. As you heard from Kenny, however, markets are softening a bit, and that is resulting in a slight reduction in our overall volume expectations, now more in the range of 3% growth for full year 2022. With more clarity on the impact from the new labor agreements, our operating ratio outlook also has changed. We now expect our reported full year operating ratio to be around 60%. As we close out 2022, attention is quickly turning to 2023. While we are not yet ready to share our outlook, it is important to reiterate our long-term view. Our focus on generating strong cash returns and improving ROIC remains unchanged, and we are firmly committed to achieving the goals established at our May 2021 Investor Day of a 55% operating ratio and incremental margins in the mid- to upper 60s. Since establishing those targets and even achieving them in a few quarters, the environment has changed with higher inflation and a weaker economic outlook. The road to achieving those milestones now is a bit longer, but our road map to success is still the same, supported by our great employees and the foundation of UP's strong and diverse franchise, we will leverage volume, pricing and productivity to achieve those goals. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As you heard from Eric, our year-to-date safety metrics have shown good sustainable improvement, which is very encouraging. However, the most important metric is for all of our employees to go home safely every day. We remain relentless in pursuit of that ultimate and most important goal. On the sustainability front, during the quarter, we announced a $1 billion agreement with Wabtec to modernize 600 locomotives over the next three years. This is a key investment as we work to reduce our carbon footprint and meet our 2030 SBTI targets. This investment also supports what our customers need as each modernized locomotive is significantly more reliable. This is true game-changing for Union Pacific. As we close out 2022, we look to capitalize on the demand available to us as we sequentially improve operational efficiency. And although we're still putting together our 2023 plan, we like our positioning relative to the industry, considering our great customer wins like Schneider, expected strong coal demand and a positive impact to our construction business associated with the infrastructure bill. I also want to reiterate Jennifer's point about our long-term view. We are committed to achieving a 55% operating ratio and mid- to high 60s incremental margins. These goals are achievable. And as we safely and efficiently improve operations, our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders will all win together. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : So I know you said it's still too early to talk more about 2023, but just given the importance of volume growth and visibility to that, Kenny, maybe I just wanted you to go through some of the areas you have a little bit more confidence and visibility at this point. And also, can you touch on the impact of the stronger dollar as it relates to the various end markets because it has been disruptive in the past for you? And then, Lance, any update on the negotiation process considering one of the unions rejected the contract, and I believe the National Rail Conference also rejected their counteroffer last night. An update on thoughts ahead and timing would be appreciated there. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Brian. I'll start with a look at the labor negotiation, and then we'll turn it over to Kenny for talking about 2023 growth potential. So when we look at the overall negotiation, we've got on UP property, five unions; on the industry, six unions that have ratified. That's about half the unions. We've got four that are out for ratification votes still, and then we've got the BMWED that's rejected their ratification early and are back into negotiation.  A couple of things to note. We've got an agreed-upon status quo or maintained of status quo with BMWE while we're negotiating out what they take back to their membership. And one of the reasons, maybe we think the predominant reason for that original vote not to be ratified is that the PEB recommended both wages. And they also, for the BMWE, recommended a change in their compensation for travel to the work site because about 40%, sometimes more of that work team goes to away-from-home work sites, works for seven days and then comes back. So a change in that travel allowance and a change in the per diem while they're away from home. That negotiation on UP property just finished up last week. And so as the members were ratifying the vote, there was a section of it that they really didn't have clarity to. We think that clarity makes that vote more straightforward. And so that's part of the negotiation that's happening is exactly what's going to be embedded in the agreement when it goes back out for ratification. Ultimately, I remain confident that we're going to get our temporary agreements ratified and be able to avoid a strike. That's still a possibility, but I don't think it's a probability. Kenny Rocker : So I'll start off a little backwards here and take the currency question first. Lance and I just came back from Asia here recently, and we saw the evidence of what you're talking about. We're really looking at how the consumer is going to spend their money. We're seeing some evidence that they're spending more on the services right now than the goods. We're seeing that show up in the parcel shipment. And so we're going to just watch that pretty closely week to week. So I talked a little bit about some of the markets that we feel very bullish on. Obviously, coal is one of them. Eric and his team and our commercial leaders have done a really good job of being agile and put resources, incremental resources up to capture that business. On our biofuel market as an emerging market for us, we feel good about the order book of customers that are coming on. We're going to bring on two new plants here in the next, call it, three to six months, which is very encouraging for us. Grain is going to be a tough comp, but we'll see how that plays out. On the Industrial side, housing markets, we're seeing our lumber shipments taper off a little bit. One of the things that I'd tell you about Industrial is on the construction product side, our rock shipments are still relatively strong, and so that's a positive for us. Our metals business has been strong. A lot of the rebar goes into construction materials for highways and roads. So that's encouraging for us. A lot of the other sheet and coil is helping out the Automotive business, which is also -- I talked about that being up. Automotive is up. Dealer supplied at their facilities are low. They're about 30 today. Some of the OEMs that we talk to, their dealers supply for inventory at their dealerships is in the single digits, in the teens. That's going to be a positive for us. The rest of the quarter, I mentioned this a little bit early on the international intermodal side. It will be a positive for us. We've got an easier comp. And then we're going to keep an eye on, again, domestic as we're moving through Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I guess maybe I wanted to clarify a point on the full year operating ratio. So I just wanted to make sure, I think you said reported 60 for the full year. So does that include the $114 million that's sort of excluded from the adjusted third quarter? I guess that's my first question. Just sort of piggybacking on that, as you think about the sequential progression, it sounds like yields probably decelerate just given what's going on with fuel. But can you talk a little bit about sort of the cost dynamic? Maybe moving forward, it seems like maybe a bit bigger than normal seasonal step-up in the operating ratio in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Can you just sort of elaborate a little bit on that? That would be helpful. Jennifer Hamann : Sure, Chris, and thanks for that question. You did hear right. So the 60% is the reported operating ratio. So that does include the impact of the PEB, the $114 million that we took the charge for relative to the change in estimates as well as the ongoing impact, which, as I mentioned in my remarks, was $19 million in the third quarter and will be likely a similar amount in the fourth quarter. So we absolutely do have that cost inflation. You also, I think, referenced fuel. That is going to flip on us, we believe, from third quarter to fourth quarter where it was a tailwind for us in the third quarter. That flips back to a headwind of a decent amount, we think, now in the fourth quarter. So that's going to be an impact. And of course, mix was a little bit negative for us here in the third quarter. That's probably going to look a little bit worse as we move into the fourth quarter. So kind of putting all those things together cumulatively on a sequential basis, we are expecting the operating ratio to deteriorate some even as we're bringing more volume on and still working to take costs out of the network. But we have those headwinds. And as you know, with those inflationary things, in particular, while we're very confident we're going to offset that with price, there is some timing there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Wanted to focus a little bit on the intermodal side and break up between both domestic and international. On the domestic side, you obviously called out sort of a weakening truck market going to be a little bit of a challenge. How should we think about that going forward in terms of the yields? And on the international side, how should we think about what we've seen as a big shift from the West Coast to the East Coast? How much of that traffic shift do you think will be permanent in the long term? Lance Fritz : Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes, I'll start off with the international intermodal and just kind of walk you through it. First of all, one of the things that is encouraging to us is that we're seeing the percentage of traffic that goes on to the West Coast and move to our inland facilities increase. And so again, that means that less of that product is being transloaded on the West Coast. So that is a positive to us. That's encouraging to us. We're pushing up, I'll call it, product and solutions up against our customers in that light. For example, our Katoen Dallas to Dock facility last quarter had its highest volume of West-bound traffic there. Also, we opened up our Global 4 ag relo facility in August. So those are things that we're doing to make the product a lot more encouraging. So keep that in mind as you're thinking about the West Coast versus the East Coast. Then on the domestic side, again, I mentioned and called out the fact that in our parcel business, we're looking at that fairly closely as we're kind of heading into the last part of the year. We have seen the inventory rise a little bit. We -- that is reflected in some of our inland terminals to a very small degree. We've seen the spot rates lower, but we haven't seen that in the contract rate. We'll know more about that as we head into a bid season, which is in, call it, December 4. Lance Fritz : Yes. And Jason, I'd just add one thing, and that is we're encouraged by the movement of the international boxes between ports and inland, right? That's fluid, looks pretty good. We've taken some of the box count down off of the ports. That's approaching back to normal. We still have an issue with trying to get boxes off the inland ramps and process through warehouses. There's a lot of inventory sitting in warehouses right now. And the U.S. consumer is going to have to chew through that for us to be able to get street times and boxed well on the destination side back to normal. Jason Seidl : Okay. And any -- and the comments that I made about yields, if we do see a bleed in the contract rates on the truckload side, Kenny, how should we think about pressure on intermodal yields as we look to '23? Kenny Rocker : So first of all, I think, again, it's just a little too soon to tell. Hey, I'm not ready to concede all the tightness that Lance just talked about, might not show up in firming prices on the contract side. So it's just a little too soon to call that out. Lance Fritz : Doubtless, there's a headwind there through the bid season, and we'll have to just see how it plays out. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : Eric, you spent most of this year, probably even much of last year trying to bring on resources, mostly labor, but all these resources that you needed for fluidity and productivity, et cetera. And now you feel like you're getting close, if not there, into a slowing demand backdrop. So as you look about going forward, do you have the flexibility and the nimbleness that you've had in prior cycles to maybe manage some of those resources down if demand is weaker than you expect? Or do you need to keep the network a bit more over-resourced in the short term, given these challenges that you've had and maybe even more intense scrutiny from the regulator? Eric Gehringer : Yes. I appreciate that question, Jon. Without a doubt, as we've demonstrated in multiple times, unfortunately, we have the ability to bring down our resources in line with volume. In my prepared comments, I made a point to point out that we want to be more than volume variable. So that playbook is known, and we've demonstrated an efficiency in being able to do that. Now as we think about that and we think about the last 1.5 years to your point, there are three things that we continue to be focused on. Our ability to hire no matter what the market is remains critical. As part of that, we continue to work on how we think about making our jobs even more attractive to the population. So no matter what the market is, we can attract the talent that we need.  At the same time, as we look at resources and continue to be able to balance them, to your point, you will see us, as we've had in the past, reestablish AWTS, which is a way for us to have a little bit of a buffer. It's not thousands of people. It's a couple of hundred people to be able to react both on the upside and the downside. So we have that playbook. We clearly have demonstrated our ability to execute it, yet we continue to take lessons we're learning to make that playbook even stronger. Operator : Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Eric, you mentioned in the slides that you're getting ahead of your 1,400 hiring goals for T&E this year. Can you think -- can you help us think about how much more hiring we need to do to kind of maintain the service levels that you need to be? Like what are you thinking about in terms of headcount for next year? Obviously, you don't have the volume plans and everything else, but are we still in the process of catching up from a headcount perspective for where you need to resource the network? Or are you -- if we get to 1,400, are we there? Eric Gehringer : Yes, David, great question. So to reiterate, we set out the year to start hiring 1,400 people. You heard in my prepared comments that we've done that. Now admittedly, 1/3 of that 1,400 have been hired, and they're in the training pipeline. So we won't see the benefit of having them towards -- until the end of the year, between now and the end of the year, really. As we think about looking out at our hiring demands, as you pointed out and as Kenny highlighted, there are obviously questions about the markets. We'll stay close to those. We'll use the same process that we've employed in the past to ensure that we don't fall short of hiring. And at the same time, as we look, we're really focused on attrition. You have a couple of questions that are outstanding with regards to the implications of the ratification with some population of our employees, and we're going to react to that accordingly. So it's really about the markets, what do we need to be staffed to for that and contending with attrition. David Vernon : And is it right to think that there's a little bit of buffer you need to add in there for some of those agreements around extra pay, paid time off just having some people -- more people on staff? Is that something that's also sort of contemplated in your hiring outlook? Or is that -- how do we think about that from a productivity standpoint? Eric Gehringer : It's contemplated and always has been contemplated. Certainly, inside the agreements that are still out for ratification, there are questions around additional time off, and we'll adjust accordingly for that. I think the more important part of that is how do we think about that AWTS program and making sure -- but again, it's a couple of hundred people, and it's viable, and it's something that we can rely on. Jennifer Hamann : But David, I think it's important to remember, and Eric said this, we still expect that we can be volume variable even with those agreements. So we're going to see volumes exceed whichever -- what happens in the economy, you won't see headcount grow to the same extent. Lance Fritz : 100%. One last thing to note, David. We got to step a little carefully here. We've committed and we've started and been in negotiation with some of our crafts, the unscheduled jobs specifically to try to find ways to get scheduled time off. Part of the PEB and this negotiation address that, but it's a far bigger issue that needs to be addressed on property in job design. That's underway. We think there's a path to do that without a substantial or kind of meaningful impact on overall headcount requirement because what we're trying to do is we're trying to make availability of employees flat across the week, right? So you don't get spikes in crew availability and layoffs. And the way you do that is you make time off predictable, and we think that trade-off is feasible. We think it's absolutely going to be happening. We don't think there's a large impact on employment through that. Jennifer Hamann : And it could actually give us better crew availability. Lance Fritz : 100%. Jennifer Hamann : That gives us opportunities. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : So I get that you're -- obviously, it's too early to give us 2023 guidance or anything, and then you did reiterate your commitment to the long-term targets. But Lance, I just wanted to get a sense with all of the moving parts you see right now, are you confident that you guys can get pricing over inflation next year with kind of higher inflation inputs and pressure on the top line from what's going on in the macro? Lance Fritz : Yes, Ravi. Short answer, yes. Longer answer, there are a lot of moving parts. There are going to be some headwinds into next year. Inflation is quite real. But as we look at rolling up a budget and starting or really at the tail end of putting our plan together for sure, we are confident we can get pricing above inflation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Kenny, I want to go back to your comment that you put out there about leaving demand on the table. Can you maybe help us understand or quantify what you think that headwind was? And then as you're talking to potential new customers, has the service challenges that you guys faced this year impacted some of that conversion to new accounts? Just any thoughts there? Kenny Rocker : Yes, a couple of things. One is, I'll tell you, Allison, that's hard to quantify. Clearly, we saw second week of September, mid-September, and it probably lasted for a couple of weeks a dip in our carloads, probably more noticeable in our premium network than it was in our carload network. So Allison, I can't give you a number. Lance Fritz : Yes, we can tell her where it's at, right? Most likely, we left stuff on the table in coal, probably some left on the table in grain. I think that's where Allison is looking for. Kenny Rocker : Yes. On our -- I'd say, mostly in our bulk market, I mean, or unit train market. So if you look at our coal business, a little bit in our grain business, probably some on our fertilizer business. And there was a little bit more demand in our rock network. So primarily associated with our unit train business, which consumes quite a bit of crews and resources. Lance Fritz : And Allison, I think it's safe to say that there was less in the third quarter than the second quarter. And as we're entering in the fourth quarter, there's less again. So the whole idea isn't for all unmet demand to go away, right? There's -- at some point, when you're running the business, it's good to have people want you that you don't have resources for. The issue is making sure that's not performance-based, that we're not leaving demand on the table because we weren't performing. Kenny Rocker : So the thing I'm encouraged by, and Eric talked about this is that we did have more resources, and we have added more sets in. We are putting more resources up against it. We do have more crews coming on. So I'm more encouraged now we're in a better place. Lance, you talked about it, second to third, but we're in a better place today. And we're working closely together. That's on the unit train network. What you don't see is that our commercial team is working closely with operating on the carload side. So if we are seeing a little bit of softening on the lumber side, we're supplementing a little bit of boxcar and covered hoppers to capture areas where we do see the demand. The other part of that, I think you talked about just overall new customers coming into the network. Our customers face some of the same challenges that we did in terms of hiring and getting some of the resources. So they understand that. They realize that, that was a, I'll call it a short-term challenge for us. We're bringing on more resources to give them confidence. We're putting more capital for the growth. And so that gives us a lot of a lot of good things to articulate to our customers as we're talking about our preparedness in the future. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Hoexter : It looks like we're opening up a little rough morning here. But thinking about your volume outlook with falling demand but improving fluidity, how do you win share in that environment, particularly given the rapidly loosening trucking environment? I guess I'm more speaking on intermodal, Kenny. It looks like your volume target for the fourth quarter is down to maybe 7%, given that full year 3% target. And then how do you win share if your trip plan compliance is still 58% to 62%? I mean, it just seems like after PSR, we should have been able to bounce back. I get the employees are still coming on, but just given that differential. And then, Jen, can you just clarify some comments you made on the real estate gain and pension? Just to clarify what was maybe onetime versus ongoing? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Ken, let me start with that, and then we'll give it to Kenny. So on the real estate side, we called out that we had a sale with -- I don't think I said this in my remarks, but that we had a real estate sale that impacted other income. We said that, that real estate income was $35 million. The pension benefit, that was actually probably about, call it, $14 million, $15 million higher year-over-year. That's something that we have seen through most of the year and maybe not quite to that magnitude, but should continue into the fourth quarter to a degree. But the real estate piece is the one that I would consider more onetime-ish. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So I've mentioned this a little bit earlier on our premium side. It really is a mixed bag as we look at it. We expect our international intermodal business to be up in the fourth quarter. Domestic intermodal, we're going to be looking at that closely. I talked about the shift in preferences. Now I want to mix up fourth quarter and 2023. Looking into 2023, we've made it clear we've got another large private asset customer coming on base, which is a positive for us. How do you win in this type of market, it's all the investments that we're making. We feel good about the increased ramp capacity that we're putting on. We feel great about the tech that we're pushing up against the intermodal network in terms of precision gate technology, which will be great for our -- the driver experiences there, quite a bit of investment, both line of road that's over there in terms of sidings that will be lengthened. We are putting quite a bit of investment up against that intermodal network to be prepared to compete and grow with it as we look into the future. Lance Fritz : And part of, Ken, your question is as predicated, I expect you to snapback quicker given PSR, why isn't your trip plan compliance better on premium and on your manifest side. And the short answer is they continue to improve. As we see car velocity, which is now approaching the 200 number last couple of days, that continues to improve. And what you saw posted for second Q and 3Q is much better now in print as we're entering 4Q. Kenneth Hoexter : But is that what gets you to the 80s from the 50s, 60s? Is it the employees? Is it the speed? What gets you back to where you were running? Eric Gehringer : Yes. So the biggest opportunity we have is really the congestion that we saw have been working through. And Lance pointed out earlier in the conversation regarding the west ports and the fluidity there. That translates. If you look into our velocity gains throughout this quarter, a big portion of that has been on the intermodal side. When I look on a daily basis at our arrival performance at terminals as well as our departure, those are both improving. Those are contributors to increased TPC. Yes, additional people are helping in certain particular markets, but it really is about the fundamentals, and I see them improving week over week. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Jennifer, the 3Q to 4Q OR deterioration, is that relative to the reported or the adjusted? And then just bigger picture, you reiterated this year pricing in excess of inflation. But with that positive price and positive volume, margins are going to be down about 300 basis points this year. So maybe just sort of help connect those two comments. And then maybe more importantly, just what's your confidence of improving the OR next year relative to this 60 OR we're seeing in 2022? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Ken (sic) [Scott]. So the comments about fourth quarter is really talking about the adjusted, so adjusted here the 58.2. We see some sequential deterioration on that adjusted basis, not on a reported basis. So that's a good clarification. Thanks for that. In terms of 2023, again, still putting the plan together and a lot of moving pieces and parts. Probably the biggest part of that is really what's the economy going to be doing. But we know that we have opportunities to grow. You've heard Kenny talk about that. You've heard Lance mention that. We also know that we have continued price opportunities, and we feel very confident in our ability to price above the inflation dollars. And you heard Eric talk about the fact that we have certainly the opportunities to improve our overall efficiency. So putting all those things together, as we sit here today, I'm not going to give you, obviously, any numbers. But we are confident that we will be able to achieve margin improvement going from 2022 to 2023. Scott Group : And maybe just to ask it differently, like if we got positive price and positive volume, and we're giving up 3 points of margin, what were the causes of that 3 points that maybe could go away next year or maybe not, I don't know? Jennifer Hamann : Well, I mean, just in this quarter, we'll just talk about this quarter, we had 310 basis points of margin deterioration in terms of the service inefficiencies and the inflation. So that right there is your 300 points. And so to the extent that we can do better offsetting that, don't have an inflation number for next year yet, certainly going to be impacted by the higher wages. This year's inflation, while we came into the year thinking inflation was probably going to be around 3%, and that would be higher than what we've seen historically, it's probably going to be closer to 5%. So -- and it's accelerated, obviously, as we've gotten here in the back half of the year and had some of these wage settlements. So it takes a bit to catch up to that with some of our pricing and as we're approaching the market, but we are confident in our ability to do that. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : In terms of the intermodal business, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on how the onboarding of Knight-Swift has progressed year-to-date, the extent to which both partners may have left opportunities on the table in the first year based on supply chain congestion and whether you think that represents a tailwind as you look ahead to 2023. Kenny Rocker : We have been very encouraged. I think Knight-Swift would also agree the onboarding has gone very well. Both companies have stayed very close to each other. Sure, there have been some supply chain challenges, but chassis dwell is not where it should be. It actually stayed pretty elevated for some time now. So there could be some volume tailwind as that kind of loosens up as we move into the future. But I can tell you that onboarding them has gone very well, and I'd use the word seamless. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Ariel Rosa : Great. So Lance, you talked about the path to getting to a 55 OR. I was hoping you could just elaborate on that a little bit. And do you think that's primarily driven by price? Or are there further efficiency gains that you guys think you can realize to get there? And then on the pricing point, obviously, the labor negotiations have been very public. I wanted to know to what extent that's kind of influenced discussions with customers on how much yield you might be able to get as you think about 2023? Lance Fritz : Yes. Okay, Ari. So the path to 55 is really pretty plain. It hasn't changed. This year, we ran into a rough patch. We ran the network type. We got into trouble on our crew availability, and we're digging out of that. We've made progress in the third quarter, and we'll make another strong step to normal in the fourth quarter. I anticipate we enter into the back half of 2022 in the 200-plus car velocity. We're essentially there at this point and need to grow from there and then be normal going into 2023, which I anticipate is going to be the case. As we do that, there is, for sure, an opportunity to take excess cost out of the network. Now having said that, we're fighting against pretty significant inflation. You see it in the PEB, but it's across the board on our services and our inputs. We're going to have to overcome that with price, and we anticipate we will. We're confident we will, but that's not helpful on the OR side, right? So you got to create margin somewhere. For us, that's got to be incremental volume. At this point, incremental volume is going to be a more important part of the three-legged stool into the future years. We're set up well to exceed what the industry is going to do. We're doing that this year. I think we're going to do that again next year, and we're going to have to make hay with it. And that's what gives us confidence that we're going to be able to improve margins going into next year. That's the clear path to a 55 operating ratio. And again, I don't think we said it yet today, but reiterating leading the industry in terms of our margins. So Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I mean, we've said it as a management team, we're going to cover inflation with price. But just to get a little granular here, our commercial leaders have done a really good job sitting now with customers, making adjustments to the rate real time, again, real-time discussions to reflect the inflationary environment that we're seeing to date. And so we're articulating the why behind the need for those adjustments with rates, especially in light of the capital that we're expending and then also the fact that sequentially our service is improving. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Jennifer, I just wanted to understand with respect to the walk from '22 to '23, I understand there's a lot of macro and uncertainty, but you have the tentative agreement. So you should be able to obviously at least help us a little bit on what the incremental headwind is from the tentative agreement in 2023. It looks like -- I mean, the slide was very helpful in the back. It looks like it's like $44 million a year. Is that the right way to think about kind of on day 1, the incremental headwind in 2023? And then, Kenny, I just want to understand, so Lance just talked about getting to 200 car miles per day. There's still a huge gap, given where fuel is obviously on the economics of moving something by rail. As we think about kind of the near-term volume, the weekly volume trends, it's kind of stuck in this low to mid-160,000. If the asset -- if the cycle times get better, because you're able to get to 200 or get to 200 plus, is there more volume for you to move in the near term? Like can we see a corresponding step-up immediately if we start getting to that 200-plus car miles per day because of where the economics are today? Jennifer Hamann : Okay, Amit. Thanks for that. Let me start, and then we'll turn it over. So the 22 you referenced is for the first quarter and second quarter. That was before the wage increase that became effective July 1. And so the thing you have to remember is the way that the wage accruals or the wages work is it's a July 1 increase. So effective July 1, we went from I think it was 3.5% to a 7% increase. And so when I referenced in my comments, $19 million was the wage impact inflation, that's the third quarter impact, similar amount in the fourth quarter. Those two impacts will carry into first and second quarter of next year. And then July of 2023, it goes to a 4% increase. So that's how you need to think about that. So 7% increase first half, 4% increase in the second half in terms of just the wage inflation piece relative to that. Does that make sense? Amit Mehrotra : Yes, it makes sense, but I'm just trying to -- I'm just -- maybe I'm lazy. I just wanted to see if you can give us a number. I mean, it looks like if it's $20 million third quarter and fourth quarter, and then another incremental -- I'm just -- it doesn't see -- it looks like it's kind of like $50 million to $60 million on a net incremental next year versus 2022. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, it's another, call it, $36 million to $38 million in the first half and then something a little bit less than that in the second half of it going to 4%. So you're thinking about it the right way. But that's -- again, that's wage inflation. We know that there continues to be inflationary pressures, particularly in our purchase services category when you think about the labor that is contracted labor. So don't have the full year inflation number, not ready to share that. But there's certainly wage inflation, PEB inflation, but there will be inflation above that again, 5% for this year. I don't know that we'll be quite that next year, but it's going to be much higher than our normal, which -- or higher than what we thought kind of back at our May Analyst Day, which was 2.25%. We're well beyond that now. Lance Fritz : Yes, oh, yes. Kenny, there was a question in there about... Kenny Rocker : Yes, Amit, we're -- as you can imagine, we're looking at the economy, and we're looking at our carloads daily, weekly, monthly. But as the velocity improves, there are some areas that we see demand out there. I mentioned coal. I mentioned rock, auto, finished vehicles. Auto parts is another area where we see quite a bit of demand that's out there. And so yes, I think that there's still an opportunity for us to capture more volume in the near term. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Okay. Our next question will be from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Benjamin Nolan : Yes. Actually, just to follow a little bit on the latter part of Amit's question there, just thinking about areas of the market that -- where you could pick up volume that maybe you're underserved at the moment. And thinking about the fourth quarter specifically, we've heard a lot about how there's water level problems in the Mississippi, and the barges can't move around. Is it possible or do you have the capacity in the fourth quarter to maybe make up for that at all? Is it something that could in the immediate term be a little bit of a tailwind for you? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I'll tell you, we've been working with customers. We've been working closely with Eric's team. The short answer is yes. We've been talking to our customers. As you know, this will be incremental volume to what we have today. So based on that, we're working with our customers to make sure that the rates reflect that's incremental volume. But yes, I don't want to say that it's going to be a large amount of volume for us that we're going to take. But what you need to hear is that we're working with customers. I'm looking at Eric, we have a good plan to go out and capture some of that business. But again, that barge market is a huge amount of product that seems to be kind of misplaced right now. Lance Fritz : Yes. And Kenny, helping our owners understand this, we ship in a normal year grain to the river up North on the river, and then it heads down the river. That's a carload. What's going to happen is the flow of those carloads is going to go all the way down to the Gulf. And so it's a carload, but it's a longer haul, and for sure, we see that demand showing up right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : I guess, Lance, the 55 OR target has proved pretty elusive for most carriers when they put it out there. And just in hindsight here, looking at what's happened the last couple of years, as you try to get resources out, service falters, and you can't move the volume that's out there. Is that the right metric we should be focusing on anymore? I mean, does it even make sense to target a 55 OR, maybe something higher with more resources, but better asset turns? I mean, Jennifer did mention focusing on ROIC. So I guess, can you speak to that over the longer term? Lance Fritz : Yes, Brandon, and that's a fair question, but here's how we think about it. We do believe that, that 55 is achievable. We don't think it sacrifices the service product for a number of different reasons. You look backward in the last two years, as you know, there's just a lot of moving parts there that made -- that created unique headwinds that bit us pretty hard. This year, it was about us getting our resources wrong in terms of crew availability and for a number of reasons, the pandemic being one of them early on. It's a distant memory now because we're kind of living as if life is normal, but that had a real live impact on us from '21 heading into '22 when we first got behind. Now setting that aside, your fundamental question is absolutely spot on, and we talked about this at Investor Day. We said just merely focusing on an operating ratio number that isn't the right way to think about our business. We think more important to our business is long-term sustainable incremental margins being the railroad with a leading margin. We think we can do that. Our franchise sets us up for that and then growth, right? And that's what we fundamentally focused on at Investor Day. The reason why we have to speak to the 55 right now is, candidly, it was a target we put out for this year. We thought it was quite achievable this year. And then a whole lot of stuff happened that made it difficult. The other thing to note is we've achieved it in a couple of handful of quarters. And that's not the goal is to nail it once and then be done with it, right? The goal is we think that the business is set long term to be able to handle it. Now things could change, and you're pointing it out, Brandon. But they haven't changed yet to make us believe it's unachievable. More important to us right now is continued progress, get back on track of improving our margins and grow. And that's what we're focused on when we go into next year. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And we really -- we think about it, too, in terms of setting us up to be competitive in the marketplace and win. That's what having that very solid competitive cost structure does for us. And that gives Kenny and his team the ability to go out there and win new business to leverage across that very efficient franchise. Lance Fritz : 100%. And again, I think we got to point this out. We are performing best at the top of the heap amongst our peers today, and I think we're going to repeat that again next year in terms of growth. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Just keeping on the OR focus here. I know you underline reported on that guidance. And I can understand you're kind of adjusting it for the third quarter, given that you're putting in some prior period adjustments. But isn't the 60 OR, I mean, that's taking into effect prior period under accounting for labor. So isn't 60 the right number for this year? It shouldn't be reported or it's not a number we should adjust. Am I -- I know I'm going to get that confusion, and I know it's going to -- so I want to nip that in the bud now. Is that the right way to look at the 60 OR is the real number for this year and shouldn't be adjusted. Is that right? Jennifer Hamann : No, I wouldn't agree with that because the 60 OR includes, call it, $92 million. And that's what's shown on that appendix slide for 2020 and 2021. And so that is -- those are dollars that really pertain to prior years where -- and again, it's primarily due to this bonus that we were under accrued. So while I wouldn't take the whole $114 million out, maybe that's to your point, that we were under accrued. So is the piece that you need to think about when you're thinking about repeatable OR. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That -- okay. Got it. And then for next year, I heard the word confident a lot. I heard confident about price, confident about efficiency but not confident enough to give the OR guide for next year of 55. And I'm just -- what I didn't hear you say confident about was the volume outlook for next year given uncertainty of the macro. Is that the only thing that's keeping you back from giving a 55 -- in other words, if we see even modest growth next year, is 55 achievable for next year? Jennifer Hamann : No. Hopefully, what you heard from us is say that while we still absolutely have that goal, the road to getting there is longer. And it would be a pretty big stretch for us to go from again, something less than a 60 when you take out the $92 million, but call it a high 59 kind of OR to get into that 55 range next year. That's not where we think that we can get to. We certainly believe that we can get improvement. And the level of that really is going to be dependent on how we see the macro environment shape up to a degree, and that's where we're still putting the plan together. But that was what we were intending to communicate is we can still get to a 55, but we're not going to be able to snapback into that range we don't believe in 2023. Walter Spracklin : And that's the swing factor to volume. You feel confident enough that network fluidity and all those issues will be kind of resolved next year that, that won't be a significantly constraining factor. Is that right? Lance Fritz : Yes. Running the railroad normally, being a normal kind of operation next year, that's not a constraint. The constraints are lots of incremental inflation. Volume, that's a question mark as to exactly what it's going to look like. So you've got that right. Next year is a normal railroad and basically back to squeezing out incremental efficiencies with a lot of inflation that we're going to have to find to overcome. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, I was just going to say, as you know, we don't have the access to reprice 100% of our contracts next year. So there is a bit of some timing there as we catch up on some of those contracts as they roll. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Kauffman : Jen, just a quick question. That $114 million, does that represent an accrual on all outstanding labor contracts, including the ones not yet ratified? Or is that only for the agreements that have been ratified to this point? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Thanks for that clarification. It is for all of the agreements, both ratified and tentative at this point because those are the deals that are literally on the table and that are waiting ratification. So that's what we know to be able to take the accrual for. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Jennifer, when you look at the cost per employee trends, the 8% in the third quarter and the 7%, I think you implied for the fourth quarter pretty close to the union wage increase for the second half of this year that started on July 1. As we look into next year with 7% on wage increases continuing in the first half and 4% in the second half, is there anything that you can do to maybe get the realized cost per employee below that? Or is that actually kind of a decent proxy for the kind of inflation that you'll feel per head next year? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Thanks for that question. I mean, certainly, that's the starting point. But as you heard us talk today, where we will look to end out would be something less than that because we know there's inefficiencies in that and that we're working to squeeze that out. I referenced overtime and borrow-out costs. Those are real headwinds to the overall cost structure relative to our employee costs. While we'll probably have borrow outs for a while as we're working to catch up in some of these hard-to-hire areas, we would hope to be in a position to certainly slim that down and then ultimately eliminate that as well as be able to manage the overtime better. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : Just to clarify that 2023 commentary, are you still assuming that you'll be able to grow volumes next year? And as we think about your comment around improving the OR in 2023, is that predicated on that volume growth? Or do you feel like even if volumes are flat or maybe even down a little bit that you can still improve the OR from the cost takeout as network inefficiencies improve? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Thanks for that question, Justin. I mean, again, no numbers being given here today, but we have some good tailwinds as I think both Lance and Kenny have talked to you about in terms of volumes. We've got Schneider coming on, large piece of business. We have demand that we know we didn't move today on the coal market, some of our bulk markets, we know good construction demand going into next year from a rock standpoint. So our expectation is to be able to outperform the market as we said back at our Investor Day. And so if you look at industrial production now, I think forecast for 2023 are in the negative range. But even outperforming that could put us on the positive side of the ledger a bit. So that's how we're shaping things up right now. I'm not going to give you degrees. And obviously, it's going to depend on what really ultimately happens. My crystal ball isn't quite that good yet to know exactly how the economy is going to fare next year. But we do like our setup going into the year, and that's how we're thinking about that at the moment. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : I wanted to ask you a bit about truckload pricing sensitivity. I think there's generally a sense that given enough time, railroads can recover inflation with price. But you are looking to do that against a market where truck -- the truckload market is a lot more loose. So kind of how much of a barrier is that to accelerating your price? And how much of the book do you think really is sensitive to the truck market in terms of pricing? I guess the second one would just be on imports. Do you think -- I mean, it seems reasonable to think that import, container imports might be down next year. If they're down meaningfully, can you still grow your intermodal? Or is that a pretty tight link just in terms of import activity and UP intermodal? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So just again, just trying to differentiate the two. On the domestic side, you're right, there's still a few more question marks there. As I stated a little bit earlier, we're going to get into our bids even here in December. We'll find out a little bit more about where the markets are. As I stated, there's still enough capacity constraint that are out there in the supply chain on the domestic side that could firm up some of the pricing. We just have to see how that plays out. On the international intermodal side, it's still too soon to tell what will happen there. I wanted to make sure that I really highlighted the fact that regardless of what's happening with the actual volume, the percentage of international rail volume has increased is coming into the port. So again, last year, we talked a little bit about the fact that we had a larger percentage of our customers transloading on the West Coast port. Today, as we stand, we can see that our customers are now moving more of that via rail. So that's a positive for us. Lance Fritz : Yes, those moving parts, Kenny and Tom, are hard to discern exactly how they're going to play out. It sure does look like inbound port container volume is going to be down in the -- certainly the early part of next year. I mean, we're hearing enough markers of that. But depending on what happens with our percentage that's coming inland depends on what exactly we see, right? Thomas Wadewitz : Right. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Sorry, I had some technical issues before. But just a quick question on the auto sector. Is that something that could deviate from the economy, just given dealer inventories at the lot as we think through to next year? I mean, will there need to be fill regardless to what happens to the consumer outlook? Kenny Rocker : Yes, we certainly believe so. There are just a number of markers that point to it. I talked about the supply of the dealership is very low, much lower than the OEMs wanted to be. Average age of a car out there now is 13 years old. There's just a lot of pent-up demand in terms of shippable, non-shippable, meaning the OEMs have actually produced the cars, and they haven't moved via rail yet. And then just the fact that, again, the part supply, the semiconductor chip, I think that's going to improve here. And so based on those things, we feel very bullish on that auto part in the finished vehicle side. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for joining us this morning and for your questions. We look forward to talking with you again in January to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. Until then, please take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. And welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The fourth quarter and 2022 overall were challenging for Union Pacific and our employees. The lengthy labor negotiations tested our work force, while customers felt the impact of our service issues. Two things are critically important as we turn the page to 2023. First, is the trend line of improving freight car velocity since late summer, although acknowledging there were bumps along the way. And second, is how we move forward, establishing consistent service for our customers day-in and day-out and demonstrating to all stakeholders our commitment to excellence. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. This morning Union Pacific is reporting 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% deteriorated 360 basis points versus 2021, driven by continued service challenges and the impact from winter weather. For the full year, reported operating ratio finished at 60.1%, deteriorating 290 basis points, driven by operational inefficiency, inflation and higher fuel prices. The entire Union Pacific team recognizes that 2022 did not beat expectations. Crew constraints in critical locations impacted by shifting demand had a real impact on our performance. As you will hear from Eric, we are building resiliency into the network through hiring efforts, shifting critical resources and better operations to address that shortfall, and you are seeing those benefits manifested in how the network has responded since Thanksgiving through the ups and downs of extreme winter weather. These challenges aside, we achieved volume growth for the year. We demonstrated our commitment to meet customer needs with business development wins that are critical to long-term financial success. The recent onboarding of Schneider is a great proof statement of delivering on that commitment. We also made significant progress towards our climate goals. In 2022, we increased our biofuel blend to over 4.5% on pace to achieve our 2030 target of 20%. This is a key initiative in achieving our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In addition, for a fourth consecutive year, we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, lowering at 1% to an all-time record. This helped our customers avoid 23.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck. Union Pacific will continue to be a rail leader in sustainability. Now let\u2019s start with Kenny for an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was up 1% compared to 2021. Gains in our Premium Business Group were partially offset by a decline in our bulk area. However, freight revenue was up 9%, driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong price. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 7% compared to 2021, driven by a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 2%, driven by a decrease in export grain shipments. Despite strong market demand, we faced service and weather challenges that slow shuttle cycle times, as well as having a tough 2021 comparable. Fertilizer carloads were down 15% year-over-year driven by reduced shipments for potash due to market softness along with another tough comp the 2021 fourth quarter. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced shipments of finished beverage product and their associated raw materials. And lastly, coal and renewable carloads remained flat in the quarter, as our ability to capture demand from favorable natural gas prices was impacted by weather and service challenges, particularly in late December. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains, somewhat offset by a negative business mix. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 4% year-over-year driven by lower Industrial chemicals demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth, driven in part by our business development efforts. Volume was up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments and growth in construction materials. Forest products volume declined 17% year-over-year, driven by weak corrugated box demand and softness in the housing market. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by an increased waste and soda ash demand, partially offset by pure petroleum shipments from regulatory changes in Mexico markets. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 15% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 12% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 9%, driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Intermodal volume was up 2%, driven by increased international shipments, mainly due to an easier comp in 2021. Although domestic volumes decreased due to soft market demand, declining truck rates and increased over the roll capacity, the aforementioned negative impact was partially offset with the Schneider conversion in December. Now as we look ahead to 2023, you can see the macro indicators that we are watching along with inflation and interest rates, and you will notice that we have some challenges with Industrial production, imports and housing starts. However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to Slide 8. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment. As I wrap up my comments, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our customers and the operating team. Over the past month, extreme weather events impacted large portions of our network and I want to thank our employees who safely worked around the clock in harsh conditions to keep the railroad running for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 10, safety is at the foundation of everything we do. We have enhanced our training programs and are working to solidify our safety culture through ownership and personal accountability. These efforts drove an 18% improvement in our 2022 full year personal injury safety results, which is at the lowest level in five years. We look to leverage these gains to improve derailment performance in 2023. While good progress, overall, our goal remains returning each employee home safely at the end of the day. Moving now to Slide 11 for a look at our current operational performance, our attention throughout 2022 was focused on onboarding the necessary crew resources to operate a fluid network and meet customer demand. I would like to thank our partners and workforce resources and the operating team for their great work in recruiting and onboarding new team members. We currently have around 600 employees in training as our pipeline is significantly stronger than it was a year ago. That being said, our hiring efforts will continue in 2023, as we backfill for attrition and target locations across the northern region, where crude challenges persist. In the near-term, we will continue to utilize borrow outs to supplement crew shortfalls. Another key element in increasing fluidity is the reduction of excess inventory, which builds the foundation for a strong and resilient service product. I am proud of the progress we made, which would have not been accomplished without the dedication and tireless work of the commercial and operating teams. Mother Nature threatened to derail some of that progress in the last weeks of December with blizzard conditions and extreme cool temperatures across much of the network. However, our team responded and we quickly rebounded demonstrating greater resiliency that we can build on in 2023. With current freight car velocity around 210 miles per day and trip plan compliance measures demonstrating sequential improvement, we look to maintain that progress as volumes strengthen into 2023. Now let\u2019s review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 12, which continue to trail 2021\u2019s results. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance were flat sequentially from last quarter\u2019s results. Importantly, however, Intermodal trip plan compliance did improve 11 points sequentially, as supply chain congestion alleviated, resulting in less stack containers at the inland ramps. Near the end of the quarter, we successfully onboarded the Schneider Intermodal business and remain actively engaged to manage that transition. Turning to Slide 13 to review our network efficiency metrics, which also like 2021\u2019s fourth quarter measures, locomotive productivity, workforce productivity and train length all declined sequentially driven by lower volumes in the back half of the quarter and winter weather challenges. Entering 2023, the team remains focused on strengthening the network while recovering lost productivity. Moving to Slide 14, we continue to exercise discipline in our capital spending, while delivering value to our shareholders. We are targeting 2023 capital spending of $3.6 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. While the projected increase from last year, we expect capital spending to remain in line with our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. As always, our first capital dollars will support our existing infrastructure. This spending will harden our infrastructure, renew older assets and support safe operations. For 2023, in addition to a higher inflationary environment, the elevated capital spending will be driven by increased locomotive spending of $175 million. With 430 modernized locomotives currently in the fleet, we will bring the total modernized to over 1,000 by the end of 2025. These modernizations not only help build resiliency into the network through enhanced reliability and productivity, but also further the progress towards our carbon emission reduction goals. We continue to invest capital for growth. On the Intermodal front, we are investing in additional capacity at the Inland Empire terminal and we will be expanding our footprint in Kansas City. And on the capacity side, we will continue to invest in projects like sidings that drive productivity, allow us to handle more car loadings and improve our network efficiency. Wrapping up on Slide 15, we are dedicated to improving our service product in 2023. Slide 15 provides a roadmap of the key activities to achieve that goal. We demonstrated meaningful improvement in our safety results in 2022 through an enhancement to our safety management systems and continue towards the goal of world class safety. Additionally, we recognize the importance of quality of life concerns that our agreement professionals voiced. We continue to work closely with union leadership to find win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. As we sustain improved operational performance, use our resources more efficiently and reduce variability, we will generate productivity. At the same time, technology enhancements will drive further productivity and support a consistent and reliable service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with fourth quarter income statement on Slide 17. Operating revenue in the quarter totaled $6.2 billion, up 8% versus 2021 on a 1% increase in volume. These gains were more than offset by a 14% increase in operating expense, which totaled $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Operating income of $2.4 billion declined 1% versus 2021. Other income remained strong, up 11% to $92 million, driven by higher real estate income and pension benefit, which offset 2021\u2019s $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense increased 13% as average debt levels increased more than $3 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 4%. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in essentially flat earnings per share at $2.67. Fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% increased 360 basis points, driven by higher inflation and operating costs. Falling fuel prices during the quarter had a favorable 20-basis-point impact. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, Slide 18 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared to 2021. Volume contributed 75 basis points. As fuel prices stayed high year-over-year, fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenue also remained elevated, totaling $975 million and increased freight revenue 850 basis points. Strong core pricing gains that exceeded inflation dollars were more than offset by a negative business mix, resulting in a 25-basis-point decline in freight revenue. Fewer forest product shipments combined with higher International Intermodal and rock shipments drove the negative mix. Turning to Slide 19 for a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses, the largest driver of the overall expense increase was again fuel, up 43% as fuel prices rose 46%. Combating these higher prices, we continue to drive productivity, improving our fuel consumption rate 2 points to produce a fourth quarter record. Our compensation and benefits expense was up 10% versus 2021. Total fourth quarter workforce levels increased 4%, reflecting our hiring efforts throughout 2022. Cost per employee grew 6%, primarily driven by wage inflation. In addition, cost pressures from network inefficiencies in the form of higher overtime and borrow out costs continued in the quarter. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 18%, driven by cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume related purchase transportation expense at our loop subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents increased 3%, driven by the impact of slower cycle times on car hire expenses. Other expense was flat in the quarter, as higher travel and casualty expenses were offset by a partial insurance recovery related to 2021 bridge fire, as well as lower state and local taxes. Looking to 2023, we have opportunities across the Board to improve efficiency and that\u2019s job one as we recover our service product. Although we still expect to be more than volume variable with our workforce, we will continue to aggressively hire crews in critical locations and to backfill attrition. For 2023, we expect our all-in inflation to be around 4%, while cost per employee is expected to increase in the mid single digits as elevated wage inflation is partially offset by productivity. Depreciation expense should be up around 3% versus 2022 and below the line, similar to last year, we expect other income to remain elevated versus historic levels driven by higher real estate and interest income. Finally, we expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Moving to Slide 20 with a quick recap of full year 2022 results, which are shown on the slide as reported and include the impact of the third quarter PEB adjustment. Revenue was up 14%, an annual record, driven by increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and 2% volume growth. Record operating income increased 6% to $9.9 billion, which includes a net increase of just under $700 million from fuel surcharges. Our full year reported operating ratio of 60.1% deteriorated 290 basis points versus 2021. Network inefficiencies and inflation were the primary components of the degradation with the PEB adjustment and higher fuel prices impacting the full year operating ratio by 30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively. Earnings per share finished the year at a record $11.21, a 13% increase versus 2021 results. Our consistent and disciplined approach to deploying capital back into our railroad coupled with volume growth that produced increased operating income drove a 90-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to a record 17.3%. Turning to shareholder returns on the balance sheet on Slide 21, full year cash from operations increased over $300 million to $9.4 billion, a 4% increase from 2021. The first priority for our cash is capital investment, which finished 2022 at $3.4 billion or just under 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate finished 2022 at 82% and free cash flow totaled $2.7 billion. Although a decrease of nearly $800 million versus 2021, that includes an almost $700 million increase in cash capital, a more than $350 million increase in dividend payments and $70 million for PEB back pay settlements. Our dividend payout ratio for 2022 was around 45%, in line with our long-term target, as we rewarded shareholders with a 10% dividend increase in the second quarter and distributed nearly $3.2 billion. We also returned cash through strong share repurchases, buying back 5% or $27 million of our common shares at an all-in cost of $6.3 billion. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $9.4 billion to our owners in 2022, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. We closed out the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings as we finished the year A rated by Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch. Turning now to our view on 2023, we think about the year ahead in two parts, what we can control and what we cannot. We don\u2019t control the markets we serve, and as you saw on Kenny\u2019s slide of economic indicators, it\u2019s a mixed bag in terms of expectations. We do control the way we compete in those markets with the great foundation of the UP franchise. Onboarding Schneider is clearly the marquee win for 2023 and with Kenny\u2019s team posting profitable wins across the Board, we are positioned to further outperform the market. In 2023, that will be evidenced by car loadings that exceed Industrial production. Another area where we don\u2019t have direct control is the current inflationary environment, which continues to be elevated. However, we know we have it within our control to improve operations. As you heard from Eric, it\u2019s imperative that we improve the reliability of our service product, while regaining lost productivity. In addition, as we have demonstrated consistently, we expect to generate pricing dollars that exceed inflation dollars in 2023. Assuming current fuel prices and our thoughts on volume, productivity and price, we expect to improve our full year 2023 operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. That said, there will be a lag to fully offset the impact of inflation on our profitability until we are able to actively touch or re-price our business while also further improving productivity. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to make significant investments into our business with an expected 6% increase in capital investments versus 2022 to $3.6 billion. Growth is the cornerstone to the long-term financial success of Union Pacific and we are continuing to invest in opportunities that support that strategy. In addition to the locomotive and Intermodal investments Eric described, we also are investing to support carload growth. The remainder of our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout of around 45% and returning excess cash through share repurchases. With our balance sheet currently leveraged at the desired levels, the amount of cash available for repurchases will be less than in prior years and predominantly funded from cash generation. With the New Year comes new opportunities and by focusing on what we can control, we are confident in our ability to provide strong value to all of our stakeholders in 2023. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. Let\u2019s wrap up on Slide 24. We made great strides on personal safety in 2022 and it\u2019s imperative we continue that momentum. The commitment made by our employees to care for one another has been exceptional, resulting in our best employee safety metrics in five years. We look to further translate these gains into better derailment performance in the upcoming year. We understand that safety is about culture and it\u2019s about engagement, listening to and responding to our employees needs and ideas will continue to improve our safety performance. Our robust hiring pipeline and improving network fluidity strengthen crew availability. That leads to a more efficient and better service product that enables us to recapture lost productivity. Over the past couple of years, we have demonstrated our commitment to customer-centered growth as reflected in business development wins, and while growth in 2023 may be challenging given the uncertainty of the economic backdrop, we will continue to make strategic capital investments in support of our long-term growth objectives. Our fundamentals for long-term success have not changed, powered by our best-in-industry employees and franchise, a strategy built for profitable growth and a more efficient and reliable service product, Union Pacific is poised to do great things in 2023 and we are ready to prove it. So, with that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Eric kind of a bigger picture question for you, if we go back to the Investor Day and you laid out a multiyear productivity improvement for the network, obviously, some of that\u2019s been delayed given the macro challenges. But are you confident that you can eventually obtain the aggregate plan over time or does the slower macro backdrop, higher labor costs, some of these recent service challenges, weather, et cetera, I mean that, the total aggregate improvements are reset at a lower level going forward? Eric Gehringer : Yeah. Jon, thank you for that question. As we think about that, certainly, as we look at the environment right now and what lays in front of us, it may be over a longer period of time that those actually come to fruition. But everyone here remains focused on those commitments and you see that in the activities that we have taken on in some of my prepared comments, I talked about some of the technology initiatives that are more focused not only in 2023, but even beyond that. What\u2019s sitting in front of us right now is the biggest opportunity is to improve that service product that from it drives out that excess cost when we think about our locomotive and our workforce productivity. That\u2019s job number one right now, but we are all still focused on the long-term targets that we gave you on the Investor Day. Jon Chappell : Thank you, Eric. Eric Gehringer : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning. Hey, everyone. I just wanted to ask about yields, particularly Intermodal yields and how we should expect Intermodal yield to develop in 2023, excluding the impact of fuel. There were some reports in the trade rags back in December that UP is cutting Intermodal rates by 3% effective February. I just want to get maybe this question for Kenny, but just get a little bit more color on that specific item and then how you expect overall Intermodal yields to trend as the new business comes on? Thank you. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Thanks a lot, Amit. First of all, we are in the early stages of bid season, call it, 10% to 15%. You heard me call out in my notes we are seeing some softness there in the marketplace. We have been encouraged that we are retaining all the business that we are out there competing for. I think it\u2019s too soon to call out what will happen in terms of pricing, but what I will tell you is that, we do have mechanisms for our business to make sure that we can remain competitive in a challenged market like this, but also price to the market and make sure that we are capturing some of the upside as things get tight throughout the year. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, Amit, this is Lance. But Kenny, you are also remaining confident that as we put our plan together, all that included, we are still -- we see a clear path for pricing ahead of inflation. Kenny Rocker : Absolutely. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Just maybe on the back of that answer, Jennifer, you did talk about a lagged ability to recapture some of the cost inflation on the price line, so I was wondering if you could expand on that? And maybe also just discuss your fuel surcharge revenue that does appear to be above fuel expense for a certain period of 2022 and the mix impact that Kenny was just speaking about? Jennifer Hamann : That\u2019s a lot there in one question. But in terms of the lag part, so there is that piece. When you think about our contract structure, so in any given year, call it, 50% we are able to touch directly. The remainder is longer term contracts and they roll over in some segments over periods of years. Now those generally have escalators, but there can be limits on the escalators and those are lagging as well. So that\u2019s what we are referring to as having a lag impact. As well as kind of going back to the first question to, Eric, still very confident in our productivity initiatives, but we did take a step back this year. We have to acknowledge that and it\u2019s going to take us a little bit to gain that back because the inflation is real. That\u2019s a real factor that is certainly above what we have seen historically when you think about 4% kind of number for 2023. So that\u2019s that piece. You also mentioned fuel surcharge, and yeah, that was a positive contributor to us on an EPS operating income front in 2023 and so depending on what you estimate for fuel prices, that could be a headwind for us at some point. Overall, we averaged, I think, 365 [ph] for the year. Right now, we are paying closer to, call it, 315, 320 [ph]. So that could certainly be a difference when you think about year-over-year comparisons on the fuel surcharge revenue. Lance Fritz : I think he also asked about mix. Jennifer Hamann : Mix. I knew there was one more in there. So from a mix standpoint, yeah, I mean, fourth quarter mix was certainly negative when you look at it. And one of the things probably that really jumps out at you think about Intermodal, but in particular, International Intermodal and the year-over-year comparison, when you think about last year, International Intermodal was down substantially and then we saw it grow here in the fourth quarter this year, plus forest products, some of the Industrial segments a little weaker in the fourth quarter and higher rock shipments. So it\u2019s kind of that all-in and look there, Brandon. Now I think it covers. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you, Jennifer. Yeah. You did. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Ari Rosa : Great. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the target for growth to exceed Industrial production. It seems like a little bit of a low bogey given the service improvement that\u2019s expected for 2023, given the cost advantages for the railroad and then in particular the addition of Schneider\u2019s Intermodal business. You have obviously see a lot of volume in recent years, but I wonder get a little bit more clarity on kind of what that means in terms of that expectation for Industrial production, I am sorry, for growth to exceed Industrial production? And then over kind of a longer three-year to five-year time horizon, how you are thinking about the prospects for UP to grow volume significantly ahead of kind of economic growth? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Ari, this is Lance. So I am going to start -- I am going to focus my commentary on 2023 and then I will turn it over to Kenny to broaden that out. Clearly, what you are seeing from us is a perspective that says there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as we enter 2023. You could see it in some of the macroeconomic indicators that Kenny shared but you can hear it and see it across the Board in many markets right now and so while we are confident we can outperform Industrial production, which is an underlying driver for a fair amount of what we ship, going beyond that and becoming more granular just is it\u2019s a little too early in the year given all the uncertainty that we see, so hard to stop on that. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. So, Lance, I want to hit hard for those on the call, the mindset of this management team and the commercial team is really to drive business development and so that\u2019s one thing that we can control. There are some markets out there that we really want to go after that we think are right. Renewable diesel is one of them and we feel good and confident about the wins there. If you look at finished vehicles, both the finished vehicle side and also the auto parts side is an area that we feel good about. There are some expansions that are coming along our line that we won in the petrochem area with plastics and Industrial chem. And then also, we have talked and been very bullish about metals as we have seen some wins come up there. So very focused on the things we can control and been encouraged that car velocity has been improving along the way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. So I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the price commentary. Can you say like kind of broad brush, what you are assuming on Intermodal revenue per car and coal revenue per car. What are you assuming when you talk about pricing dollars above inflation? And then maybe if you can just offer a comment and kind of broader pricing, is the dynamic changing in rail competition? You have won a bunch of business over the last, I don\u2019t know, 18 months. Is that having an effect on the competitive dynamic or would you say things are pretty stable? Jennifer Hamann : So, Tom, let me take the first part of that question, and then I will let Kenny address the second part. We are not going to give comments on directional guidance for RPU for various line items. You know the factors that are going to drive that. It\u2019s certainly the pricing but also fuel surcharge and then the mix of the business within that line. So those will all be things that will play into what that turns out to for 2023. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Let me lead again with something Lance mentioned that we feel very confident that we will be able to price over the inflation dollars. So I want to say that, our commercial team has done a great job of articulating the need to price to the market. When we talk about price into the market, we have talked about some of those dynamics. Inflation is one our customers are facing that, too. They understand that. But we also talk pretty broadly about investment. When I say investments, part of what I am talking about is what Eric is doing with our capital plan. The other part is making sure that we are resourced the helm of growth. So we are doubt in on that, we are having those conversations with customers and we are articulating that. Lance Fritz : Hey, Tom. This is Lance. We have also got to recognize that I think underlying your question certainly in the Intermodal space is that the truck market is pretty darn loose right now, and certainly, it\u2019s not as fruitful of an environment to be pricing in as, let\u2019s say, a year or year and a half ago. But that doesn\u2019t change any of what Kenny just said. It just makes the job harder. Tom Wadewitz : So you assume that in your pricing guide that you have those pressures on Intermodal price I guess? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Lance Fritz : All-in\u2026 Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Lance Fritz : \u2026 we understand it and it\u2019s assumed in there. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to talk on that growth and sort of that service product commentary, a lot of investment obviously being put into the productivity headcount and so forth to drive that this year. But as we look past that, are you thinking through that service product differently in terms of investment, whether it\u2019s trying to improve the ease of doing business with you or transparency with customers, just any thoughts there on how that might be evolving over time? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Allison, thank you for the question. This is Lance again. We are thinking more broadly about what is necessary to support growth in our service product and it takes a lot of different forms. I will start in the Intermodal space. We have made investments in things called UPGo and Precision Gate Technology. PGT allows trucks to essentially enter and exit the ramp without stopping. Paperless and uses technology and pre clears, if you will, the load with machine vision before the truck even gets there. UPGo is a holistic tool that our IMCs can use and it can be embedded on their own platforms so that once a drivers on our property, they know exactly where to go, they know exactly where all the facilities are, they know a map of the facility and we have done a hell of a job signing and improving the signage on our properties. So that\u2019s just one example where if truck drivers, if dray drivers have a better, faster experience on our property, we might be able to help them get an extra turn now and then that helps move boxes off our ramp and that\u2019s a better service product than the end. But why don\u2019t I turn it over to, Kenny, you first and then Eric for more detail. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Lance, you talked about our Premium network. And again, Allison, those products show up in terms of Inland Empire in our product in Twin Cities that we feel very encouraged and confident about and filling those areas out. And it also shows up in other areas like our investments in GPS, our investment in chassis. On the carload side, we are really excited about what\u2019s taking place with RailPulse. So you are seeing it across the Board both on our carload side and in our Intermodal network. Eric Gehringer : And Allison, as we think about consistent and reliable service, a couple of examples from the operating side that we are all involved and as -- and when I talk about modernizations, an improvement in reliability of 50% in those locomotives wants modernized, it\u2019s significant, it\u2019s meaningful, it\u2019s less variability that will drive improved service. And even as we think about even on our crews and we are talking about how do we approach that differently. When we talk about consistent schedules for our crews, we are talking about the trade or the benefit for us collectively which has improved availability. Improved availability again reduces variability and drive a more consistent and reliable service product. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Allison. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Lance Fritz : Hi. Scott Group : So if inflation is running around 4% and price mix is running flat, slightly negative right now. I guess, how do we get confidence in margin improvement for the year? I guess maybe, Jen, do you think is it the price mix reaccelerates from here, is it cost getting better? Just help us sort of get confidence in that margin improvement? And then just separately, any color on this -- on other revenue and how you are thinking about that for the year? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. So I will start with the confidence around the margin improvement and we are confident in our ability to do that. Certainly, there are headwinds and you have just pointed to a couple of them. But then go back to the things I talked about in terms of how we are looking at the year and the key levers, which as you know, are volume, price and productivity. So volume certainly is a wildcard and we will see how that plays out. Pricing, we are confident that although it is going to lag a bit, we are confident that our price will -- price dollars will exceed inflation dollars. And then the productivity side, we know we have upside there. Yes, we are still adding resources and taking some steps to heal the network today. But we also know that there\u2019s a pipeline of opportunities to improve and we have those identified and we know what actions we need to put up against that to do that. And then as you do that and as the network hills, that gives us more opportunities on the volume side. We still know we are mixing Bulk loads today. So those are opportunities for us to get more leverage across that cost base. And then, obviously, there\u2019s fuel, which I mentioned before and we will see how that plays out. But right now, we are certainly playing a little bit less, call it, $0.40 or so less than what we were paying a year ago or what we paid for the full year 2022. So those are all the things that we are looking at, Scott, and we believe that those combination of factors are setting up in a way that we will be able to drive OR improvement. To your question on other revenue, so I think that\u2019s really a question maybe more geared towards accessorials and what we see playing out there. As the supply chain has healed, as we are seeing a little bit of softness in that Intermodal market, we have seen accessorials come down a bit. They were down a little bit for us here in the fourth quarter and that would probably be my expectation going into 2023 as well. Lance Fritz : And that\u2019s a good thing, right? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. Absolutely. Lance Fritz : I mean, we want that fluidity. We want the entire network to match the kind of fluidity that we are putting up post Christmas holiday. They are still in the Intermodal supply chain. There\u2019s still some elevated street time for boxes and chassis. And that\u2019s the last piece that reflects excess inventory that\u2019s going to have to get worked out. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Good morning. Question on the operating side a little bit, maybe, Jennifer, if you can help us understand what were these unique costs is in network congestion in 2022, so we can kind of play those numbers going forward. But the main question I got is, if I look at your operational productivity data in the fourth quarter and compare that to a couple of years ago when you were running well, locomotive productivity, car velocity are still 13%, 14% lower than they were and headcount is 5% higher, but volumes are flat. Do you have now the resources you think to get back to those levels that you have had a couple of years ago, like what are the really remaining things we need to do to get the network to spend a lot higher than it has been in the last few quarters? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. I wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know that I totally caught the first part of your question there, Fadi, but I think you were basically asking to quantify what the congestion costs were for our network for 2022. We have not quantified that other than we -- when you look at our operating ratio and the degradation that we had on a year-over-year basis, 290 basis points, 50 basis points of that was a combination of PEB and fuel. The rest of that was inflation and congestion and probably fairly equally weighted between the two. So that\u2019s how I would think about that. That is our opportunity certainly and that feeds through all of the lines. It feeds through wage inflation. Now some of that, obviously, is real. We have the PEB. We know that\u2019s real. But then it\u2019s how we use the crews, and you have heard us talk about the fact that in 2022, we had higher recrew rates, we have higher borrow out costs, more deadhead and held away, more vans. Those all inflate those cost categories. Purchased services, as we were putting more locomotives into service, that inflated those costs on a year-over-year basis in addition to some of just the contractor inflation that we saw as all of our suppliers were faced with higher inflation, and you saw that come through. And then on the other line, we know we have opportunities there from a casualty standpoint. You heard us talk about casualty a couple of different times in 2022 and the higher cost that that brought to us. So those are all elements that we are now very much focused on attacking. You asked are we right-sized yet. You have heard us say, we still are short crews in critical locations. We are still hiring. Fadi Chamoun : Yeah. Jennifer Hamann : So we still need to bring folks onto our network. That does two things that helps the -- well, three things only helps improve our reliability, our fluidity, it helps us move more volumes and as we are able to hire folks in those critical locations, we then move the people that we have working there in terms of borrow outs back to their home location and that reduces our cost base as well, and you can improve your recrew rate. So a lot of different moving parts there, Fadi. You know our business isn\u2019t just one element, but that\u2019s how we are looking at it. Those are the things that impacted us in 2022 and that\u2019s what we are looking to do in 2023. Lance Fritz : Yeah. I think the other part of Fadi\u2019s question is a structural question, like, did something structurally change. And on the five critical resources, nothing structurally changed on line of road and terminal, how you achieve freight car utilization, how you achieve locomotive utilization. We probably look at crews differently going forward than we did historically. That means a little bit more on Board so that we are not staffed at the tight end. We are staffed a bit looser, that\u2019s hundreds, it\u2019s not thousands and then also making sure that we have a watch back in place to the extent that we have got counterparties that want to negotiate that. So that\u2019s probably the only thing, and I think that\u2019s probably an at risk as opposed to a major headline. Jennifer Hamann : And helps to reduce more volume ultimately. Lance Fritz : In that. That\u2019s right. It supports us for growth. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long, Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I guess to follow up on that last question. If I just run the quick math, it seems like there was around 120 basis points of headwind to the OR last year from congestion. So as you think about kind of recapturing what I will call lost productivity, do you need to see volume growth in order to get that back or can you see improvement in the absence of volume growth? And I guess, on the cadence of the OR, Jennifer, is it reasonable to say that first half OR probably doesn\u2019t improve year-over-year, so this is more back half weighted? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Jennifer, why don\u2019t I start with, can you get -- can you recover productivity without volume growth? The answer is, yes. And we anticipate volume growth as well, which is a tailwind. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. So the only thing I\u2019d say in terms of cadence there is, really pointing out to the fuel piece of it and where you saw fuel was a bigger headwind to us in the earlier part of the year than the latter part of the year. You saw some of the inflation pick up in the latter part of the year. So there\u2019s some trade-offs there either way that I would just ask you to look at your models pretty closely there, because there are differences first half, second half in 2022 that you need to be thinking through there. Justin Long : Okay. Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Justin. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I just want to come back to the yield question, sorry, to focus on that. But there were, and Jennifer, you mentioned a number of the key drivers being core price and fuel surcharge and mix and so on. I just wanted to make sure that we are understanding the charges that you were levying of the congestion side, those search, I will call it, congestion surcharges for lack of a better word, that you registered through 2022. Are they -- with them going away, does not -- is that not another factor that will weigh against your revenue per carload or is that just not meaningful enough to enter into the equation? Lance Fritz : Jennifer, you want to take that? Jennifer Hamann : I think you were referencing congestion surcharges? Lance Fritz : I think he\u2019s talking about accessorial\u2026 Jennifer Hamann : Oh! Accessorial. Lance Fritz : \u2026cost. Jennifer Hamann : Okay. Again, we do expect that they could be less year-over-year, but I don\u2019t see that as a significant driver for us. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Fair enough. And just on the coal side, there\u2019s a lot of talk about deteriorating coal statistics, just understanding your catchment area, I know you got a plus on that outlook. How does that compare with what we are hearing from the EIA and what you are seeing in your catchment area? Kenny Rocker : Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. We feel good about being able to move coal in these natural gas prices and even the forward curve for the rest of the year. I will tell you, there\u2019s still quite a bit of low inventories out there. So I can assure you, those customers are willing and able to receive that coal demand that\u2019s out there. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Thanks for the time. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Walter. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Lance, thanks for taking my question. As the Chairman of UP, can you talk a little bit to the longer term transition plans? What skill sets do you think the Board really focused on for the next leader of the business? Any time line around that as we have seen some of the leadership at the other Class 1s start to change? Thank you. Lance Fritz : Sure, Bascome. So we have not announced any leadership transition or timing. We do periodically as a Board review what our needs are, both the skills matrix of the Board and also the skills and development of our leadership team on the management team. And so, yeah, Board has a strong eye on that, knows on a running basis, what we are looking for, what we are thinking about and while we don\u2019t have anything announced, I will make sure and we as a company will make sure that it is transparent when it does occur. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just sort of curious, what are customers, I mean, obviously, Intermodal is a big part of the longer term story and important near term, too. But what do customers tell you in terms of, hey, rails have had a tough time service wise the last year or so. When are they going to be open to really trying you guys again and maybe shifting some of that business back from truck and could that happen in an environment where truck rates are so beat up right now as well? Thanks. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Kenny, you want to take that, because we are still winning business off of truck. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I mean we are definitely still winning business from truck, and what I would tell you is that, we haven\u2019t seen any large pieces and I said that they are earlier move away from them. A lot of that is driven by the economy. Clearly, some of the service challenges we have, we may have seen some lanes move at versus via truck or maybe another mode. But our customers realize that this is a short-term phenomenon and that we are investing, we have been very transparent in our investment again in hiring and our investment in our CapEx, so that they can stay with us. Lance Fritz : Well, Kenny, sustainability has also been playing a bigger and bigger role in that, some of our sophisticated customers, we are helping them understand and they are asking us for greater detail on how we can be part of their sustainability initiatives and that\u2019s driving more look at us as opposed to less look at us. We just joined the Dallas Sustainability Index and that\u2019s just a one marker of many that say that we are quite serious in making good progress in those areas. Kenny Rocker : I mean, Lance, you talked about it a little bit earlier, if you look at our car velocity from the summer to now, we have seen some improvement, and Eric and I were talking about this a couple of days ago. If you look at third quarter to fourth quarter sequentially on our Premium network, that is improving as we onboard at Schneider. So that gives us a lot of confidence. Lance Fritz : Right. Jordan Alliger : And just sort of -- just continuing on that, I mean, the other side of shares, the West Coast probably lost to the East Coast this year for a myriad of reasons. Do you think some of that shifts back over the course of 2023? Kenny Rocker : I -- some of that was really, I think, labor challenges that you saw in the port and a little bit of ambiguity on what they thought might happen. I think as we see that clear up on the port that you will see a little bit more of that volume come back to the West Coast port. Again, everything that we are doing, all of our investments around Inland Empire, the G4 relo would act, the Dallas to Dock and Dallas. I am telling you we are bullish to make sure we can make those areas more competitive for the customers. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. My question sort of picked up on that last one. I did want to ask about the next outlook for International Intermodal. Clearly, the inventory cycle is the most important factor there. So I am curious whether implicit in your guidance is the potential for a second half recovery in Intermodal. And then along with that, I was also curious on your thoughts regarding the timing of a labor settlement on the West Coast and what you thought for that would mean for market share in LA, Long Beach, which I think you just addressed? Lance Fritz : Let me start, Kenny, and I will talk to the labor negotiation that\u2019s going on in the West Coast. So that started up, I want to say, in July of last year. There has been a negotiation. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of progress announced publicly. But the port directors share with us that they have confidence they are going to reach an agreement that there\u2019s the temperature is low and there\u2019s a line of sight to reach agreement. So from that perspective I think we are going to be okay. Kenny Rocker : Yeah. As we are spending time with customers, as a mixed bag when they think some of these inventory issues will get resolved. So some are saying back half of third quarter. For us, we are not going to try to time that or be so precise at the time. What we are really focused on is making sure that we have got the service product where it should and I just want to double down on what I said sequentially, we are seeing that improvement. We have onboarded a large customer and we are walking towards trying to capture that growth when it shows up or when a pop. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two-part question here, I think quality of life is a big focus area for you and a lot of your peers. What does that mean exactly in terms of kind of what you are negotiating and what your prospective employees are looking for? How do we think about that in terms of our costs, et cetera? And just also, I don\u2019t think you have said the word 55 OR on this call so far, obviously, that seems like a fair way away given where we are macro wise. What is the path to get there, kind of given the quality of life, given the kind of EV inflation, everything else kind of, is that just going to need like a really big lift from the topline to bring that gap in the coming years? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ravi. So I will start with just a quick comment on quality of life, and then maybe, Eric, you can follow up on what we are negotiating there, and then, Jennifer, you can handle a 55 OR. So one thing that came out of the PEB and is in the tentative agreements that were signed and now agreed to was directive to negotiate things like unscheduled work going to scheduled work. There are other things bundled into the quality of life issues for our craft employees, but that\u2019s a big one. There\u2019s a fair amount of our craft employees that are on call in an unscheduled job and that\u2019s the way that the staffing for the railroad is handled. And so we are actively in those discussions, because there is a path forward to be able to create more predictability in that work for those craft professions. I will let Eric kind of get into the detail. Eric Gehringer : Yeah. So, Ravi, as one example, we are engaged right now in a pilot where we are focused on some adjustments to the way that we collectively do the work where we actually have a group of people in the state of Kansas that are working a defined schedule. So to Lance\u2019s point, today, the vast majority of our employee base is on an on-call basis. So that\u2019s on the TE and Y side of the transportation side. In this pilot, we have carved out a handful of people where they actually are in a specific schedule and what we are watching for is to ensure that the actual days that we have planned for them to have off occur and that that\u2019s translating then to more availability on the days in which they are scheduled to work. That\u2019s the win-win solution that we are looking for and we are focused on. And we are working on it for the entire period of this year and I bet it carry into the next year because we are putting so much thought into making sure that the net impact is beneficial for both sides. Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. And then, Ravi, to your 55 OR questions, I mean, you have heard us talk that, that is still our goal and I will reiterate that again. We have not put a new time line on that because of all the things that you have heard us talk about here today in terms of the challenges that we are facing. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t improve, that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a path to improve and a path to get there. And relative to the quality of life, it really goes back to what you have heard from both Lance and Eric, as we improve crew availability, as we improve predictability, that improves our service product and it improves our ability to grow and with that service product comes further pricing opportunities as well. So it\u2019s a virtuous circle in my view and that\u2019s how we are going about pursuing those things. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I wanted to come back to headcount and resources as we are thinking about sort of improving the network and efficiency and ultimately getting back up to sort of optimal performance. Can you give us a sense of sort of how long you think it will take until you get heads to sort of where you think to be able to support the [technical difficulty] that you have and maybe is that a first half, second half kind of dynamic as you think about the relative growth in both periods? Lance Fritz : Yeah. Chris, you broke up a little bit at the end. But what I heard you asking is about, we are adding headcount and resources to support network fluidity particularly in some part of the network where we are tight on crews and how long is that going to take, is it a first half, second half? So we are not putting a fine button on when exactly we declare victory. What I will say is, you look at how we are performing coming into 2023 and the network is fluid. We have still got tight spots in the network that are limiting our ability to grow and ship all the demand like in coal, maybe to a lesser extent in rock and we are hiring actively in those areas that would support the network for that growth. The pipeline is full, we have got 600 people in the pipeline and we are graduating something like 150 a month to 200 a month at this point. So it\u2019s kind of fundamentally being pretty well healed is happening this year. It\u2019s just hard to say exactly when given that demand could shift around. We are still not meeting all demand and the game plan is operate a fluid network like we are right now, continue to add resources to support the demand that wants to ship and grow that volume as we are able to. Chris Wetherbee : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just, Jen, maybe can you put a range on the OR improvement, I know you said just you are looking for improvement, given the background issues that you talked about. Can you clarify how much of that is impacted by service and I guess you typically see 200 basis points of deterioration from\u2026 Lance Fritz : Yeah. Ken Hoexter : \u2026 fourth quarter to first quarter. Is there anything unseasonable or different this year, you pointed out a couple of things that should look different? And then a second one just for, Lance, something totally different, any thoughts on the STB Open Access mandate? Anything that you expect out of that or remediation expectations from CPK issue? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : So, Ken, I am going to refrain from giving the order of magnitude on the OR guide or giving you a range. It really is just too soon in the year. We are sitting here on January 24th to give that to you. I could try, but I am sure I\u2019d be wrong. So we are going to resist that temptation. I think the important thing to think about is we are going to work to improve as fast as we can, as hard as we can, you have seen us do that and demonstrate that, we are not trying to meter any progress. Our goal is to deliver that better service, be more fluid, and with that, leverage more volumes across the topline. There are some other things that influence it, obviously, when you think about fuel and inflation. But the team knows what those are and they know how to go about it. I am also not going to give you any guidance relative to sequential and whether we are going to have normal sequential patterns. We had a really hard hit here the end of 2022 with the weather, the way it impacted our volumes here at the close of the quarter. We have had some weather here again here in the start of the year. So hang with us, watch the volumes, watch the service metrics. Those are your best barometer to know how we are operating and how we are generating positive growth and positive financials across the network. Lance Fritz : Yes. Admitted. It really does all start with our service product. In terms of the STB and Open Access, Ken, so that\u2019s a pending decision on their part. Clearly, we have fed back for quite some time now to the STB that we think Open Access is a bad idea from the following perspective. It puts interchange where investment has not occurred. It would negatively impact the service product for those demanding open access and anyone else riding the trains and the service product that those particular customers are using. We have looked at this a lot of ways. We don\u2019t say hell no when allowing access in a certain circumstance makes sense. We have done it. We have negotiated it. We have done it in short periods to help customer out. But in the broader context of allowing customers to determine where their interchange point should be, we think, as currently conceived, it\u2019s -- it would be bad for overall service product, not better. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. So a couple of different follow-ups, if you don\u2019t mind. One, just on mix for Jennifer, it sounds like the trends impacting the fourth quarter probably will continue for 2023. I just didn\u2019t hear if you confirm that or not? And then for Eric, you are talking about getting to a better spot with headcount, do you expect any attrition from when all the back pay clears as maybe some of the more senior folks take that retire or look for something else as that comes up in the next couple of weeks? And lastly, Lance, another hot button topic for STB embargoes, a little hard for us to tell exactly the implications of the two-day hearing from last month, but would be great to hear your thoughts on what changes if anything after that? Thanks very much. Jennifer Hamann : All right. I will start with your mix question, Brian. So for 2023, we are expecting to have a negative mix for the year and really it\u2019s pretty simple when you think about it with increased Intermodal shipments with the onboarding of Schneider. And then you heard Kenny talk about tough grain markets and then also some of the question marks and toughness that we are expecting on the Industrial product side. Those things add up to negative mix for us in 2023. Eric Gehringer : On the attrition side, we have not seen any attrition post the payment of the PEB. We continue to watch that very closely and where necessary we will incentivize. Lance Fritz : Yes. And that -- the last big back pay happened January 13th, right? Eric Gehringer : That\u2019s correct. Lance Fritz : So it\u2019s in hand, and to your point, Brian, if something occurs, we should be seeing that basically right now, it should start. In terms of the STB on embargos. So, yeah, we were called in for a two-day hearing. The reason is that Union Pacific historically in 2022 had used embargoes more so than all of our peers. We use it for a very specific reason and we use it as a last resort. The reason why we use embargoes is either if something has occurred in the network like, call it, winter storm Elliott that really negatively impacted the Great Lakes region. So that we don\u2019t get overwhelmed as we are trying to recover from the winter weather, we will use an embargo in that circumstance to control product flow. That\u2019s not to stop growth. It\u2019s basically controlled product flow, so the network can get its feedback under it. It\u2019s worked wonderfully in that area, because you can see in our car velocity and the overall network fluidity, we are operating quite well. We will also use embargoes to control excess inventory in very targeted circumstances as a last resort. We engage the customers, help them understand what we see and what they could do to help control that excess inventory, and then as a last resort, we would use an embargo. The vast majority of them are about protecting the serving yards for our customers. That\u2019s where cars end up and before the last mile delivery to customers they get inventoried at the serving yard. And if a particular customer has way more inventory in that serving yard than what they can handle or what supports their business, it can crowd out the service product for others. So that\u2019s the reason we were called in is we use those more so than anyone else. We -- I am not sure exactly what\u2019s going to come out of that hearing. What we heard from our customers and through the STB and in continuing conversation with our customers is they want to know why and how to remedy with a lot more granularity. So we have modified what we communicate to our customers so that they understand that. And our commitment was we are going to pause on the level of embargoes that we have been using so that we can absorb the feedback and make some additional changes in how we approach excess inventory and serving yard excess inventory and engage with customers more effectively on it. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : All right, Brian, you win the title for getting us all the talk. I will make this quick. Two things, one, yeah, we have had some pretty difficult conversations with customers. But 1 of the positives that has come out of that is creating tech solutions for them to give them the visibility that Lance was talking about, whether it\u2019s inventory on our line, the release rates number of cars that are in the serving yard. We have shared that those tech solutions with them here a couple of weeks ago and we are working with the customer so that they can integrate that into their supply chain. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you very much. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Brian. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kaufman : Thank you very much. I will just make this quick, because a lot of mine have been answered. Kenny, what do the changes in China with their COVID policy and reopening the economy potentially mean for Union Pacific? Kenny Rocker : We will have to see what plays out there. Historically, what we have seen is a little bit of fits and starts. I think what we will also be looking at is the inventory levels at least in the near-term, it may not have that much of an impact as they start up a little bit later, it may be right in time. So a lot of uncertainty there, definitely some fits and starts. What we really need is the consumer spending and a little bit more demand to be out there more so than the issue in Asia. Jeff Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to resourcing questions really quickly here. Also I will keep it on one theme as opposed to make only guys kind of go around the table. What is the exact number of heads we are looking to add in 2023 and if we are thinking about adding more crew resources and automotive resources to get a service level that\u2019s more resilient, how does that change the dynamic of adding future resources to see the growth? I know it won\u2019t be one for one, but are we looking at a little bit less put the leverage here going forward based on the changes you are making to the resourcing model right now? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. You were breaking up there quite a bit, David. But I think what your basic question was, was how many do we expect to hire in 2023 and do we think about hiring at a different cadence maybe versus volumes going forward? In terms of hiring for the year, I think, we have said it would be similar probably to 2022 levels. But that obviously carries with it some attrition assumptions what we see happen with volumes and so if we would see a change positive or negative relative to volumes that obviously could impact that, we are just going to make sure that we have the right crews in place to be able to take advantage of the demand that\u2019s there for us. We know we are still not meeting at all today. In terms of how we think about hiring, I mean, I think, you have heard Lance and Eric talk about the fact that we would maybe keep our Boards a little bit larger established A once if we can and those will be things that can give us I will say cushion, as you see fluctuations in demand. Again, we expect to be able to leverage that service reliability into more volumes and better pricing and overall better productivity. And so when you think about the bottomline impact of that, we think it should worst case be neutral, but really be a positive for us in the long-term. David Vernon : Yeah. I understand the foundation will be positive in the long-term, but, I mean, we are adding more resources to do essentially the same amount of volume right now, correct? Jennifer Hamann : Yeah. I mean you are seeing that flow through today, I would say. When you have got 600, 700 people in training today. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Jennifer Hamann : Not out actively moving freight, that is the headwind that we have in those numbers today that I would say is already there. Lance Fritz : Well and it\u2019s substantial because they are completely unproductive from a moving freight perspective. Jennifer Hamann : Right. Lance Fritz : But we anticipate we need them to both backfill attrition and support growth. David Vernon : Right. Thanks for added color guys. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks. Lance Fritz : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. The anchorman position, I won\u2019t make any [Ron Bergan] you referenced this year. I wanted to get back to domestic Intermodal, guys. I am assuming the positive growth outlook is basically the Schneider business and some of the freight that you guys lost last year that\u2019s more of a natural rail fit flowing back to the network. But I want to look a little bit longer term, sort of as you look to the competitive marketplace with the trucks, where do you think the visibility needs to be and will RailPulse help you improve that? And then where do you think trip plan compliance needs to be and what else do you need to do to get that up there? Kenny Rocker : Yeah. I will tell you. Thanks for that question, Jason. We have been encouraged as the management team with all the investment that we put into the railroad to support growth and we have talked about those products here a little bit today. We do think that Inland Empire is transformative for us. We do think that the Twin Cities Intermodal facility is transformative for us. We do think that the focus on technology, some of which Lance mentioned a little bit earlier that will help drive our experience. What ultimately helps our customers reduce their costs with their drivers will have an impact. And then, Jason, everything you just said, RailPulse is for our carload business and we put a lot of focus on making sure we can do ease of business and know exactly what our customers are asking for. Eric Gehringer : And on the performance side, from the service product, Jason, we have been very consistent over the last handful of years that our Intermodal trip plan compliance, starting with an eight, like, 80%, 85% is where we want to be. But or and we are also very close to our customers over the last two years to continue to make sure that what we are measuring is most reflective of their experience and what\u2019s most important to them. So stay tuned because we continue to evolve how we think about customer service in line with the customer\u2019s voice. Jason Seidl : And is there -- if you guys get to that 85% or above, is that when it starts inflecting in a normalized demand market in terms of getting more freight on the network? Eric Gehringer : The way to think about that is really when you get to 85%, what we are recognizing as we are an outdoor factory. We are 32,000 miles. We do deal with winter, et cetera, et cetera. There\u2019s nobody here that gets to 85%, because we have done our job, but it\u2019s a place to strive to get to and then reevaluate even within the challenges of being an outdoor factory with 32,000 miles, hey, what\u2019s the next opportunity still? Jason Seidl : Fair enough. Appreciate the commentary as always. Lance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Jason. Operator : At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I will turn the floor over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : Rob, thank you very much for your help this morning and thank you all for your questions, we are looking forward to talking with you again in April about our first quarter results, until then please take care. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We do thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The story of the past quarter for Union Pacific is one of resiliency, battling heavy snow, Arctic temperatures, flooding and tornadoes, the team maintained service levels and exited the quarter on a positive trajectory. Persevering through those harsh conditions, our employees delivered for our customers, which demonstrates again that our people are the foundation for the great things that lie ahead. Turning to the first quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2023 first quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to first quarter 2022 results of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Our first quarter operating ratio of 62.1% deteriorated 270 basis points versus 2022 driven by excess costs, inflation and lower volumes. A series of weather events throughout the quarter had a real impact on our ability to capture demand, especially within our coal business as well as added cost to the network. Through those events, our service products showed greater and greater resiliency, quickly rebounding each time as we were better positioned with crew resources to support our customers. And with April month-to-date, freight car velocity is about 200 miles per day. We are operating a network that is positioned for consistent and reliable service. While a more difficult start to the year than expected, it doesn't reduce our expectations for 2023. As you'll hear from the team, all of our goals are still in front of us. Let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Freight revenue for the first quarter increased 4% driven by higher fuel surcharges and solid pricing gains, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. Bulk volumes were muted in the quarter as weather and service-related challenges impacted shipments. Additionally, weaker market conditions for premium also drove lower volume for the first quarter. However, our strong focus on business development and new business wins partially offset by some of that decline. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 4% compared to last year, driven by a 7% increase in average revenue per car reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 1%, driven by weaker export grain shipments as world demand for U.S. grain has softened, coupled with drought impacts affecting supply in UP's served region. Fertilizer carloads were flat in the quarter. Strong export potash was offset by a decline in phosphate volume from weather conditions delaying shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 6% due to reduced beer imports and weather conditions negatively impacting both fresh and can shipments. And lastly, coal and renewable volumes was down 4% compared to last year driven by weather interruptions and associated service challenges that impacted our locomotive and crew resources. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was down 2% year-over-year driven by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production and reduced housing demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments, along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 19% year-over-year driven by soft housing starts and lower corrugated box demand for nondurable goods shipments. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 6% versus last year driven by strength in demand for LPG and petroleum products. These gains were partially offset by fewer soda ash shipments due to weather and service-related challenges. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% on a 1% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car increased by 5%, reflecting higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volumes were positively driven by strengthening OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Domestic intermodal business wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market, driven by high inventory, increased truck capacity and inflationary pressures. On the international side, despite weakened imports, more container shipped inland versus the first quarter of last year, resulted in year-over-year growth. So now moving on to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities, we expect grain to be challenged near term as export demand softens and supply tightens throughout this crop year. However, as we look ahead towards the next crop season in late fall, we're encouraged by the initial forecast. For coal, low natural gas prices and a milder winter allow utilities to build more inventory. We are experiencing normal softness through the shoulder months. Looking further out in the year, demand will largely be dependent on natural gas prices and summer weather. Lastly, we expect biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to grow due to solid market demand, new production coming online and business development wins. Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is to shrink in 2023, and the demand is getting weaker in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction and metal with new business wins. And finally, for Premium, we expect near-term challenges in the intermodal market from high inventory levels, inflationary pressures and weak consumer spending as people shift back to spend more towards services than goods. We will be closely watching for a potential market uptick in the latter part of the year. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment. So to wrap up, we are facing economic uncertainty and a tough price environment in a few of our markets, but we expect to see strength in some other commodity areas. Our diverse portfolio allows us to maintain our pricing guidance. To capture more demand, we are working closely with Eric and his team to be agile and have resources available in locations where we need them. I am confident that the team's relentless focus on business development will drive volumes to exceed industrial production this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. We continue to make great strides on safety, as evidenced by our 10% improvement in derailment performance for the first quarter. While encouraging progress on safety, our goal remains a future with zero incidents and zero injuries. We've made progress on derailments by implementing state-of-the-art technology, like Precision Train Builder and our geometry inspection fleet. This is on top of our network of more than 7,000 wayside detection devices and our 24/7 operating practices command center. Further supporting our efforts, in March, the industry announced a set of key safety actions. These include the installation of additional wayside detectors and enhanced standards for how we proactively use and share critical data. In addition, the industry is expanding efforts in first responder training and deploying technology to provide real-time railcar condition monitoring. The railroad industry remains one of the safest transportation modes in the nation. And through our capital renewal program, Union Pacific invests almost $2 billion annually back into its network to further improve safety. Now moving to Slide 10 for a look at our current operational performance. As Lance mentioned, Mother Nature made her presence felt across the Union Pacific network this season, bringing extreme weather in many forms. UP crews in California battled flash flooding, persistent mudslides and heavy snow. The Central Sierras, for example, recorded over 700 inches of snow this season. That's 222% above historical averages. Employees across our central corridor in upper Midwest portions of our system also worked through prolonged blizzards, ice and Arctic temperatures. These events challenged our ability to maintain a fluid operating state on specific portions of the system. However, thanks to the dedication and proactive efforts of our employees, the network quickly recovered after each event. And as the chart on Slide 10 demonstrates, we're exiting the quarter on a positive trajectory versus the congested state we were entering this time last year. Our April month-to-date metrics show a network in a healthier state with freight car velocity at 200 miles per day, intermodal TPC in the high 70s and manifest TPC on the rise as well. That result also reflects our hiring efforts as we focus on backfilling attrition and targeting locations where crew challenges persist. We currently have around 1,000 employees in training, which is an increase of approximately 500 versus last year. In addition, we have utilized borrowed out employees to address hard-to-hire locations and get crews where needed. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11. Sequentially, we held our ground through the obstacles of the quarter. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance made slight improvements from last quarter's results. Intermodal trip plan compliance remained effectively flat as we battled resource imbalances driven by weather interruptions. With our current traffic mix, freight car velocity consistently running around 200 to 205 miles per day will strengthen our entire service product, including bulk, manifest and intermodal performance. Turning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity dropped 5% versus first quarter 2022. However, it remained flat sequentially from last quarter's results as we continue to operate a larger locomotive fleet in an effort to support the recovery of the network. In the second quarter, the team is focused on moving more freight and rightsizing the fleet. To that point, we are in the process of storing over 100 units to at the ready status. First quarter workforce productivity declined 6% to 991 daily miles per FTE driven by an increased number of trainees and lower volumes. Our strong training pipeline supports our ability to capture available demand and future growth while managing and reducing borrowed out employees. As employees graduate from training, we expect productivity to improve. Train length is effectively flat compared to last quarter's results. Lower intermodal traffic, coupled with extreme cold temperatures across the Northern tier of our network presented a headwind to our train length initiatives for the quarter. The team remains committed to strengthening the network while we're covering loss productivity. Wrapping up on Slide 13. The success drivers for 2023 remain unchanged. And the entire team is dedicated to building on the momentum gained as we exited the quarter. We remain committed to addressing employees' quality of life feedback and are pleased with the recent agreements regarding paid sick leave. We will continue to work diligently in finding win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. In addition, as you heard from Kenny, we continue to aggressively look for opportunities to strengthen volumes. With the service product demonstrating resiliency, we have added back train sets and targeted freight cars to the network to capture available demand. I am confident that the foundation we're laying will provide a safer, more consistent and reliable service product to meet the growth needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. We'll start on Slide 15 with a look at our first quarter income statement. Operating revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 3% versus 2022 despite a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Other revenue decreased 5%, driven by $30 million of increased subsidiary revenue, which was more than offset by a $50 million reduction in accessorials. Lower intermodal volume and greater supply chain fluidity drove the accessorial decline. Operating expense increased 8% to $3.8 billion, resulting in first quarter operating income of $2.3 billion, down 3% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased $137 million year-over-year, largely driven by a $107 million onetime real estate transaction that contributed $0.14 to earnings per share. Interest expense increased 9%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion was flat versus 2022. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 4% increase in earnings per share to $2.67. Our first quarter operating ratio increased 2.7 points to 62.1%, following fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge programs positively impacted our operating ratio by 190 basis points. Core results offset the fuel benefit and were a 460 basis point drag to operating ratio. Included in that is the impact of weather, which is difficult to quantify. But between both lost revenue and additional expense, we estimate to be in excess of $50 million. Now looking more closely at first quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.7 billion, up 4% versus last year. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $883 million added 475 basis points to freight revenue, reflecting the lag in our programs. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue 75 basis points as ongoing pricing actions were mostly offset by our business mix. Fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments were the primary drivers of the negative mix. Turning now to Slide 17 and a summary of our first quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% versus 2022. First quarter workforce levels increased 4% with transportation employees up 5%, the result of our dedicated hiring efforts over the last 12 to 15 months. Cost per employee only increased 3% in the quarter as wage inflation was partially offset by a larger training pipeline. During the first quarter, we signed agreements with the majority of our labor unions to provide paid sick leave to our employees. These agreements became effective April 1 and represent just under half of our craft professionals. Assuming we are able to reach agreements across the board, we would expect cost per employee to be up mid-single digits for the year, consistent with what we discussed in January. Fuel expense grew 7% on a 9% increase in fuel prices as we moved less freight. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 1% as the impact of our fuel conservation efforts was more than offset by reduced network fluidity. Purchased services and materials expense increased 16% driven by maintenance of a 3% larger active locomotive fleet and inflation. Equipment and other rents was up 9% as a result of increased car hire expense related to elevated cycle times, and the other expense line grew 6% related primarily to higher environmental remediation costs. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was Presidential Emergency Board back pay settlements paid in January which totaled $383 million. That payment also impacted our quarterly cash flow conversion rate and free cash flow, with both roughly in line with last year's performance when you exclude that payment. In the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 19, we are maintaining our 2023 full year guidance to achieve volumes above industrial production, price gains in excess of inflation and operating ratio improvement. Our plans for capital allocation also are unchanged. As with every year, there are puts and takes to how the year plays out. While 2023 started a bit slower than expected, I need to remind everyone, it is only April 20. We have 8.5 months in front of us and many opportunities with volume, service and productivity. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to express my thanks to the UP team. We are skilled in running the outdoor factory that is our railroad. But Mother Nature seemed very focused on testing those skills this year given the extremes we faced, and yet the team forged ahead, keeping the network fluid and our customers served. Fantastic work by everyone. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : And thank you, Jennifer. As Eric discussed, we continue to make great strides on safety. Derailments have been in the spotlight recently. The entire industry understands the critical role we play in support of the communities we serve. In fact, since 2000, Union Pacific's mainline derailments are down almost 30%, helping make this past decade the safest for the rail industry. Working collaboratively and proactively, the industry can further improve on that safety record. Looking forward, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets are in rough shape right now. Importantly, though, there remain opportunities to capture additional demand in a number of markets. The entire team is executing a plan to capture those additional carloads supported by an improved service product. Finally, with Earth Day approaching, I'd like to highlight the actions Union Pacific is taking to protect our planet. At the end of 2022, we released our second annual Climate Action Plan, highlighting updates to achieve our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. This includes our goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Over the past year, we've turbocharged our locomotive modernization program. We've committed to both battery and hybrid electric locomotive, and we've increased our biodiesel blend to over 5%. And we're being recognized for that work. This past year, Union Pacific was selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the first time. And we were the highest ranked railroad in the transportation category on Fortune's most admired companies. Union Pacific is committed to being a sustainability leader, driving long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Before turning to Q&A, as it relates to the CEO search process, the Board is fully engaged in executing its duty to identify the next leader. And I can say from personal experience what a wonderful job it is to be at the helm of a company like Union Pacific. I'll continue to lead the team until the new CEO is identified, and I'm energized by what we can accomplish in the coming months, as well as the great potential this company has for years into the future. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Lance, any timing on CEO search? And any thoughts on what you and the Board are looking for? And then Jennifer, margins down 270 basis points. Obviously, we need some nice improvement the rest of the year to get to full year improvement. Can you help us bridge us to that full year improvement? And any thoughts on second quarter? It's an easier comp. Do you think margins inflect positive in Q2? Just any thoughts? Lance Fritz : Yes. Thank you, Scott. So I'll just circle back to the press release that the Board sent when they announced earlier in the year that we were in the process of identifying a new CEO. They were clear on what they were looking for then, right, a track record and experience in safety, customer service, business development, clear vision on culture and a good operating experience. So they are crystal clear on what they're searching for. And the only update I have for you is we're using an excellent party, external consultant, and they're being very thorough in their search, which is underway. Jennifer Hamann : So then, Scott, to your question, I mean, you're exactly right. We need to make sequential improvement through the year, and then that needs to become year-over-year improvement at some point for us to be able to meet that guidance. The factors that are going to help drive that, certainly, fuel is something that is looking different to us this year than it did last year. Particularly right now, you saw the 1.9 points that it benefited our OR in the first quarter. That will -- comparison will get a little tougher in the back half. So it may look different than '22 did. But certainly, fuel, I think, is something. But then it's the main levers that you know that we have available to us. It's volume, price and productivity. And of course, volume, it depends a little bit what that is, but we also have pure cost control. So if volumes are something that are not our friend, and we're not able to get that leverage, we also have the ability to control costs through being very careful and diligent in our management. Lance Fritz : And Jennifer, one last thing. What gives us a ton of confidence as we look into the year is how the network is operating right now. It's in a place where we can get the volume and we can squeeze out the excess cost. Jennifer Hamann : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : I wanted to ask you about the head count level. I think you know the training pipeline for T&E looks like it's larger but I think that the level of people that you've had that are trained on the system seems like it's been static for a while. And so I'm just wondering what do you think about in terms of where you need to get for TE&Y that are trained in on the system? And I guess, in terms of attrition, has attrition been an ongoing problem has that stabilized? Just thinking about that headcount dynamic and then I guess, how that fits into how you would expect network performance to go from where we are. Lance Fritz : Yes. So Tom, we entered the year saying total headcount hires addition to the TE&Y would look kind of like what it did in 2022 predicated on our plan for volume. Volume is looking a little cloudy right now to us, certainly in the first quarter in the back half. And so of course, that hiring plan is being looked at and adjusted. Net-net, in the second quarter, you're going to see us add to the active TE&Y headcount coming out of the training pipeline. The question really is what the training pipeline look like for the rest of the year? Having over 1,000 in the pipeline is a very strong pipeline for us. In terms of attrition, we tend to have about a 10% turnover in our TE&Y workforce. That really hasn't changed over the course of the last five years. We don't necessarily see it changing right now. So one of the adjustment factors is if we find ourselves getting out over our skis a little too far, attrition can help us suggest quickly. Tom Wadewitz : So it sounds like the, I guess, trained level goes up, but overall headcount kind of static as the training pipeline comes down is maybe the best way to look at it. Jennifer Hamann : I think it really does depend on the volumes to a degree, Scott. And so certainly, as Lance said, the second quarter, I think you certainly see our total head count is going up. It's going to be probably different than last year. First half, we've got the training pipeline loaded in the first half. And I think the question is going to be what does the second half look like. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : So just -- it looked like the operating service levels were flat -- you mentioned that a couple of times, I guess, Eric did, but velocity was -- really came down the past few weeks, I guess, during the quarter, and then more recently showed a pretty solid rebound, I guess, maybe the last week or two. Is there anything changing with the operating plan? Was this -- I don't know if Eric or Lance, you want to throw in some thoughts? Or was this just kind of the end of some of the weather stretches that you were talking about? Maybe just talk about how operations are doing now and what's changing. Eric Gehringer : Yes, Ken. Thanks for the question. Your summary is exactly accurate. And it was towards the tail end of winter is really where we were about 3 weeks ago, having come out of that. And with all the work that we've done on the hiring side is amongst other actions, you're seeing the output of having 2 to 3 weeks without weather being that headwind. With [weather] largely, if not entirely, behind us winter, you should expect us, as our customers expect to maintain where we are. We've reinforced that 200 to 205 miles per day. It's what drives our TPC metrics to the level our customers expect. Operator : Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : Maybe one quick follow-up on the head count point. I guess I'm just curious, given what you guys have been able to do with some degree of service recovery, would you think about pausing sort of the hiring as you sort of reassess volumes depending on sort of how that plays out in the second half of the year? Curious about that. And then maybe on that point for Kenny. Just in terms of like what you're seeing in the month of April, it seems like we've seen March and April be a little bit softer across the board of transport, not necessarily Union Pacific specifically, a little bit softness there. Curious what you're hearing from the customers. Has there been a bit of a spring lull here or maybe that picks up in the near term? Just kind of some thoughts there would be helpful. Lance Fritz : Chris, this is Lance. I'll start and then turn it over to Kenny on your second question. So let's unpack the headcount question a little bit. We are in much better shape this time, this year versus same time last year. The hiring pipeline is full, but more importantly, we've been filling our classes everywhere we've been looking for people across the railroad for about the last 3 or 4 months. That is very different than our experience last year where we found it very difficult in about crew hubs all in the Northern region to be able to find, candidly, the workforce to be able to hire. So we've been much more aggressive in the back half of last year, ramping up things like hiring bonuses, finding creative, unique ways to create a workforce, a pool to hire from. And that's paying dividends right now. So you're exactly right in terms of as we look into the year, right now, we're starting to evaluate our original plan for hiring versus what volumes are doing and what the back half of the year balance is going to look like. Our longer-term guidance remains in place, and that is we fully expect to be volume variable and have ultimately our head count grow at less than our volume numbers are growing. But clearly, coming out of last year, we had to fix the ship and get our crew boards healthy, add a little excess -- not excess, add a little factor of safety to the crew board so that we could take events and recover quickly so that our service product was consistent. And we're in that place right now. We're essentially there. We're solving some of the problem with borrow-outs. So hiring is going to have to replace them because they're expensive, and it's a burden on our employees to be borrowed. Out, but we are in much better shape looking into the rest of the year. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Chris, so let's just start off. You look at our coal, we're expecting it to have a seasonal lull this time, the shoulder months that I mentioned. If you look at it last year, natural gas prices were much higher. So this is more of a normal look for domestic intermodal. We'll keep an eye on it. It's a very loose market right now. There's quite a bit of truck capacity that's out there. So we'll be watching that. And then also, last year, if you look at it, our grain business was still pretty strong at the time of year. Now we're seeing more global grain going to places where we exported last year. Now having said all that, looking forward to the rest of the year, hey, we're still bullish about some of these markets that I mentioned, whether it's finished vehicles, the metal, rock that's in our construction area is one and then biofuels. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel. Benjamin Nolan : Maybe, Kenny, if I could just follow up with that, we've been hearing a whole lot of noise about near-shoring, reshoring, specifically around Mexico. I was curious if you can maybe put a little color around if that's something you're seeing, if there's any notable business wins or anything specific to the moving of manufacturing back to North America that you're hearing from your customers. Kenny Rocker : We are seeing a little bit of that. We've seen production related to the auto OEMs. There was one pretty large highly public analysis that came out. And with that, you got to remember there's a lot of other inputs that move by rail, whether it's soda ash or the glass, the metals that comes in for the car. That's great for us. Also, in our bulk commodities, on the ag side, we're expecting some new production and receivers out there. So yes, it is looking encouraging, and this is the first time that we're seeing tangible things that we can point toward. So that's a positive for us. I won't go on and on. We enjoy a fabulous network there. I'll leave it at that. Benjamin Nolan : Okay. And just to clarify, how should we think about the timing of an impact on that? I mean is this something that could happen near term? Or is this a big picture, longer-term kind of a dynamic? Kenny Rocker : This is a big picture longer term. I mean, you've got to get time for these locations to actually build up the physical infrastructure there. Lance Fritz : And not -- but, Ben, it's wonderful to have new production facilities spot in the North American market. We will get our fair share. We have a wonderful franchise to and from Mexico. And any time industry shows up in the North American Continent, it's good for us. It's good for railroads. Operator : The next is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : I wanted to circle back to the full year guidance. Obviously, the start of the year has been more challenging than you anticipated. So in order to hit your outlook, do we need to see a meaningful positive inflection in the freight market? And if so, when does that need to occur? And then, Kenny, maybe just a clarification on intermodal. I think you said international volumes were up, but I was wondering if you could share the percent change you saw in both international and domestic intermodal. Jennifer Hamann : I'll take the first part of that question. Again, our guidance relative to volumes is exceeding industrial production. We came into the year, industrial production was forecast to be down about 0.5%. It's actually gotten a tad bit worse. It's now down about 0.7%. So that's not a huge [bump] to exceed. And yes, we started a little weaker, down 1.5 points here in the first quarter. But you just heard Kenny talk about kind of the different markets that are available to us and the fact that, as our service product is improving, we're putting more assets into play to move more carloads, and that's giving us greater flexibility to move those assets around to hit the markets that are available to us. And so we feel quite confident that we will be able to reach that goal as it relates to volumes and the rest of our full year guidance, obviously, which we reiterated. Kenny Rocker : Yes. I don't think I'm going to break out domestic international here. But what we saw, and I mentioned that just because you do have a more fluid intermodal network on the international side, we don't have a lot of the stack boxes on either end. More of those ocean carriers are moving in one, and we're seeing that. We put in products up against that. That's helping that with our grain facility down there on the Dallas side, with The Katy and they've hit their largest volume record in the first quarter. They just announced they're going to expand. And so we feel good about that, that we can move more of that inland. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Just sort of curious, I think other than volume, you talked about other productivity or cost. Other than fuel expense may be going down, what are some of the other cost levers that you could use to help drive OR to improve over the course of the year? Obviously, volume-dependent, would be things like purchase transport. Just trying to get a sense. Eric Gehringer : It's a great question, Jordan. So as you think about that and the progress we're seeing right now, it's impacting nearly every one of our cost lines in a positive way. The big ones that we talk about is certainly starting with fleet size. In our prepared comments, I mentioned the fact that we're taking 100 locomotives and then putting them in storage, but they're in a storage state in which they can still be there quickly to gain volume. Next after that, it's all about crew utilization, right, which stretches everything from recrew rates to deadhead -- to how do we think about over time and making sure that we're being judicious with the use of over time. From there, we certainly do, even though you mentioned that we do focus on our fuel consumption. And I'm really encouraged actually by the first quarter because if you look at January, we came out very strong. February was kind of okay, and March was certainly weak, which means with weather behind us, there's no reason that we shouldn't snap right back to that great progress that we saw in January. So it's those others, but I've listed the biggest ones. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Jason Seidl : Two quick things. Kenny, I think you said there were some pricing pressures in a few of your industries. I mean I understand intermodal. Would love to hear what else is being pressured out there. And also in terms of the West Coast port labor situation, how much freight do you think got diverted? And if we get a resolution here, hopefully in the near term, do you think it would come back quickly or it would take some time? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So before I talk about domestic intermodal, which I think is your question, I just want to reiterate that we've got a broad diverse set of customers and markets that we get the price. And we've said that publicly, call it, approximately roughly half of that business, we get to touch every year outside of just one particular market. Now there is a lag impact to that. But the sales leaders, the commercial teams have done a really fabulous job going out articulating, hey, we're spending quite a bit on CapEx. We're putting quite a few resources out there. They understand what's taken place in the industry with our business on the labor side and the labor negotiations. And candidly, they are experiencing the same inflationary pressure. So you've got that piece. Now talking about domestic intermodal, yes, domestic intermodal has been a pretty loose market, quite a bit of truck capacity that's there. We're seeing it in our bids and RFPs. We've got mechanisms that are in place for our suite of intermodal customers to go out there and compete and win business based on their own strengths and capabilities, which give us confidence. And the other part of that is the fact that as the market tightens up, we can quickly capture that upside. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, Jason's last question about West Coast ports and ILWU. Kenny Rocker : Yes. We've been in close contact with the West Coast port, and they believe that there should be an agreement here near term. I'll tell you it's hard to quantify what's been diverted away because of some of these labor challenges. I'll tell you when we look at the order book going out to, I'll call it, the West Coast ports, it looks like the negative delta that we saw year-over-year is becoming less and less. Jason Seidl : That's good. And you think that there was an agreement, again, knock on wood, because everyone wants that, that you would receive it back quickly or would come back over time? Kenny Rocker : I think that's just -- I can't be that precise, Jason. We could be positive about it, but to be precise, probably just wouldn't be a good idea. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Kenny, just a follow-up on the pricing reset. Is that kind of going as is expected? Do you still have a little bit more of a lag impact because volumes may be a little bit weaker than you had thought? So I guess is that going to accelerate here? And same sort of question with price/mix. Is that probably the worst you'd expect in the near term here as you look at the different end markets as they're developing? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Certainly, the way we calculate price volume increasing and improving helps us. So I'll say that also because it is April and not December. We have time to get more of that volume in the play as we move throughout the year. I would not say that there are some markets that are harder to capture price in other than those areas where we have mechanisms in place align with domestic intermodal. We've been very disciplined in our approach to take price. And in some cases, we've all taken some risk there to make sure that we're pricing towards the market. Lance Fritz : And Kenny, the same -- what you said about domestic intermodal to a lesser degree is truly in coal where you've got natural gas can be a driver of some pricing. Kenny Rocker : Absolutely. We'll be watching natural gas pretty closely. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And to the mix part of your question, Brian, coming into the year, our view is that mix would likely be negative throughout the year, primarily around the fact that we were expecting to see more growth on the intermodal side. Obviously, that's changed a bit. And so looking to the second quarter at least, we're probably expecting a bit of a positive mix. Beyond that, I think it's too soon to say. But I do think that's something that is different as we sit here today than when we came and talked to you in January. Brian Ossenbeck : Just a quick follow-up for Lance on the regulatory and legislative side. A lot of noise coming out of D.C. Some of the safety things you mentioned earlier and some of the stats on UP specifically. But what are you most focused on when it comes to the different topics that are being discussed down there. We tend to focus on train lengths. It's obviously an FRA Safety Advisory recently. But I just wanted to hear what was important and what you thought we should focus on when it comes to the various topics being discussed after the safety issues that we've seen in the industry over the last few months? Lance Fritz : Yes, Brian. That's a great question. So in engaging the legislators in D.C., we help them understand what would actually move the ball in terms of safety, where regulatory effort would make a difference and where it wouldn't. To your point, train length wouldn't. Statistically, on UP, since 2019, train length is up something like 20% in our mainline and siding derailments are down 26%. So there's zero corollary between train length and derailments.  But there are other things that they can help with. We're taking action right now on wayside detection. That's a place where the FRA can step in. Things that we emphasize, that really don't have a corollary impact, another one is crew size and whether conductors are redeployed to the ground. That has no impact on safety around the world empirically. So we just broadly try to help them understand that and stay deeply engaged. This is a deep engagement all the time right now. Operator : The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : I just want to ask on the new business. I guess, first, is there any way -- I know there's a lot of moving parts with volumes, to maybe quantify or help us understand the contribution of the new business wins in volumes. And then second, as part of that, just in terms of the new business pipeline, any notable trends in sort of the conversion that you're seeing in terms of bringing on new business onto the rail? Kenny Rocker : Yes. It's pretty broad because, obviously, it's in all three of our business teams, meaning if you look at it, biofuels, renewable diesel for us is an emerging market. Been very encouraged by our ability to land new customers, new production sites to move out of the Midwest going into the West, and those are attractive margins to us. On the industrial side, the same thing is true as we look at our metals business and some of the minerals business tied to that. Same as with rock. Those are areas that are positive, and they have structural increases related to population growth down in Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf. And so those are great. And then you are aware -- you are aware, Allison, of some of the new recent wins in our intermodal sector. And again, we feel really blast that we've got a fleet of highly capable customers that can go out and grow business over the road, and it complements very nicely our UMP our UMAX and E&P products that we have in the marketplace. Allison Poliniak : And just any color on the conversion trends of the new business opportunities out there? Kenny Rocker : We see the pipeline is still there. The thing that we're keeping an eye on is are they actually moving the forecasted amount that they initially told us. So no concerns with the pipeline, just a little bit of concern with making sure the volume that they committed to is still there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Jennifer, are earnings going to be up as you move from 1Q to 2Q? Because there's a big fuel benefit in the EPS line in 1Q, and we calculate it like $0.25 or something like that. And a lot of that is going away because of the lag on fuel. And so you're starting kind of from a hole to build back on as you move from 1Q to 2Q. I know there's weather, but I'm just trying to understand if the cadence of earnings growth from 1Q can actually grow in 2Q because of that operating income impact from fuel? And then just related to that, because volume seems to be the fulcrum for all of this, the average weekly volume in the quarter was 152,000 seven-day carloadings, and I think last week, you did under that, and the weather is a lot better. And so I guess the question really is that like when are we going to see -- if weather was a big problem in the quarter, you exited lower than you average for the quarter, when are we actually going to see some of the volumes show up in the weekly carloads? Jennifer Hamann : Well, so let's start off on the fuel piece. And we agree with your math on the $0.25 for the first quarter. That's exactly right. You have to think about fuel in two pieces, Amit. You have to think about the fuel surcharge piece and then the expense piece. And while in the first quarter, the fuel surcharge piece was a positive, as we look at what our current prices are for fuel right now, call it $3 a gallon when we paid $4 a gallon a year ago, that's going to flip on us. And so that is going to have a different dynamic, but our fuel expense is going to be less as well. And so you really have to think about it in those two parts and separate that out, I would say, in the analysis. The other thing I want to remind everybody about 2Q of last year was we did have an $0.18 benefit from a land sale, Illinois Tollway, and that was in our results. And then we also had $35 million extra in some casualty expenses. So that goes away. So you've got some puts and takes there, but I just want to make sure everybody is thinking of as you're putting that together. Our goal is going to be to continue to drive as much volume as we can across the network, do it as efficiently as we can and improve the service product. And the output of that will be the output of that. I'm not going to give you specific earnings guidance on that. And then to your other question about volumes, I think you need to factor in the Easter holiday. That does have an impact on our volumes. And so while, yes, weather was clearing, we did have a holiday impact there. And I think, again, we're putting the assets into place, and we're going to be moving the volumes that are available to us. Lance Fritz : Yes. I'm confident what we're talking about in reported numbers this week and beyond. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That's great. And just related to that, Kenny, I don't know if you have a view on intermodal yields. I know fuel, there's a lot of noise in intermodal yields in fuel. But are we holding line on intermodal yields ex fuel? And is that the expectation kind of over the next few quarters? Kenny Rocker : Yes. And I said this, Amit, we feel really good about the mechanisms we have in place for our customers to go out there and compete and win and retain business based on their capabilities and their strengths. And I also feel good about, again, as the markets move that we'll be able to move more real time with it. And so that's a positive for us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Eric, I want to go back to the productivity, which I seem to go back to every quarter. But just as it relates to getting to these full year targets, one of your peers has kind of laid out what a fluid network could mean from a cost perspective. So is there any way for you to quantify what you think the productivity improvements could contribute in the final three quarters of '23? And also any way for us to kind of understand the timing? You're still digging out of the weather mostly. They're still taking people out of training. Is this like 90% a second half productivity improvement type story? Or can you start to get some significant improvement in 2Q? Eric Gehringer : Now Jon, thank you for the question. Obviously, we won't guide you to the specifics on the timing of the productivity. What I would reinforce is that based on the performance that we see on the railroad right now, it's bringing me and others greater and greater confidence that we'll see that productivity continue to grow throughout the rest of the year. To say -- as you look into the second quarter, the headwind of winter behind us and the forecast of being able to grow the volume, that's what's going to drive that. Beyond that, I'm not going to guide to it. We're just all focused on making sure that we drive that productivity safely. Jon Chappell : Any just broad range of numbers? I mean, if we go back to the Investor Day and the starting point there, any way to kind of parse that out even in a broad range? Jennifer Hamann : No. Jon, I think that would be unwise for us to do that. We are not going to try to pace our productivity improvement. And so we want to do that as fast as we can, as safely as we can while providing a really good service product so that we can ultimately drive greater volumes across the network. That's the real leverage, and it fuels the productivity, quite frankly. Lance Fritz : Yes. Jon, this is Lance. So just putting a bow on that. Our expectation is, in Q2 with a fluid network, we really squeeze out a bunch of the excess costs created by kind of weather and variability from those events. And then we start stretching our legs beyond Q2 to continue to recover some of the productivity and, ultimately, all of the productivity that we forewent in 2022 and then start growing from there. We've got a fair amount of inflation that's in front of us that we got to offset this year and going into next year. So we're going to be fighting that battle through the whole year as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : So two very quick follow-ups here. One is I know mix was a headwind in the first quarter. But can you confirm that dollar price was above dollar inflation in the first quarter? And kind of if not, kind of how does that trajectory change versus the year? And second, kind of if you're going to have a pretty kind of significant inflection, volumes currently are running down 2.5% year-to-date and you could get to better than down 0.7% for your full year guide, what macro assumption does that involve for the second half of the year? Are you counting on an improvement in macro conditions and/or a restock to get you there? Jennifer Hamann : I'll hit the first part of your question. And yes, our pricing gains in the first quarter did exceed our inflation. Kenny? Lance Fritz : Just a second. In terms of macro assumptions, we do not have planned in a recession, right? So a recession would be a problem for us. Absent that, what we need is markets to continue to just behave reasonably, i.e., we need consumers to continue to be healthy spend some. They don't have to go crazy. They just need to not pull in their horns. And we need the industrial economy to continue to do what it's doing. And we need inventory and this whole destocking to calm down after the first quarter, first half. All of those, I think, are pretty reasonable expectations. The wild card would be a recession. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : My one question for Lance or Eric, your trip plan compliance on manifest remains in like the low 60% level. And I know there's definitional issues, but there are carriers out there delivering much higher than that. So I wonder -- we've talked a lot about service products on this call today. What's the right target for trip plan compliance? And what are the steps to get there? Eric Gehringer : Yes. So they're focusing on the manifest and autos. When that starts with a 7, so right, 70%, 75%, that's in a place where our customers are giving us feedback that says that we are meeting their expectations. Now as far as steps to get there, you're going to always have manifest and auto lag the intermodal TPC, and it's simply because the cycle time of those cars is longer. It's a conversation we were just having the last two weeks to make sure that we are doing those actions. So when you look at the velocity picking up, that's a tailwind to it. When you look at our use discounts, which means are we making connections in the terminals to the right trains, that's up. Just those two things alone drive TPC in the right direction. And we're driving that as fast as we possibly can because we want to send the message to our customers that we understand first quarter was difficult, but we're in a better place now and it's for their benefit in ours. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Walter Spracklin : I just want to come back to service levels and the regulatory spotlight. Clearly, the whole industry Union Pacific included, is under a bit of a spotlight from the regulator for the service issues. And when I look back historically, whenever a railroad is needed to promptly address the service issue, operating metrics almost always deteriorate rather than improve. So I don't know if this is best for Jennifer, but I want to come back to that question about are you expecting an OR improvement as early as Q2 based on what you're seeing now? I know you said you saw some pretty good exit trends in Q1, weather is behind you, Easter was more of a -- it was more of a numbers event or a year-over-year numbers event as opposed to anything fundamental. So would you see yourself as on track to achieve Q2 improvement despite your efforts to address service and that, that Q2 improvement should continue through the rest of the year? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Walter. I'm going to resist the temptation to give you 2Q guidance and stick with the full year guidance. But you all can do the math. I mean we have to make improvement quickly, and it's got to be sequential. And at some point, obviously, that has to be year-over-year, and that is our focus. And that is our intent, and we're very confident that we will do that. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And if -- and barring that then perhaps year-over-year is at risk if you can't see that quickly as the quick turnaround that you're mentioning Jennifer. Is that fair? Jennifer Hamann : The longer you go into the year with that improvement, it gets more difficult. Yes, I will agree with that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Can you talk a little bit about how your relationships and engagement with the STB has evolved over the last few months? And any expectations of how they'll extend the service period -- sorry, the service oversight period when it expires in a few weeks here? And maybe walking that forward next 12 to 18 months, where do you think their eyes will be most focused? And how do you engage with them as the CPKC deal stops sucking up oxygen in that room? Lance Fritz : Thank you for the question, Bascome. So we are deeply engaged at the STB. There is an executive level interaction with an STB either staff or member virtually every day, certainly several a week. What is helping in those conversations right now is, demonstrably, the service product is better and customers' temperatures are down. The other thing, if you recall, late last year, there was a hearing at the STB that focused on Union Pacific and our use of embargoes. And we, to the STB and to our customers, more importantly, made the commitment that we're going to both look at how we use embargoes and have an eye towards essentially getting back to a place where they're rare. Year-to-date, this year, 65% reduction in the use, in the last two months 75% reduction as the railroad is getting better. And I have all the confidence in the world that kind of progress is going to continue. So what I expect at this point, the STB is a bit of a wildcard. I won't predict what they do in May as regards the service reporting period. But I know the overall industry and certainly Union Pacific is in a place where our service product is not prompting more scrutiny and significant temperature coming into the STB from customers. And that's their -- that's their purview. That's what they're built for, is to react to customer feedback, and that's what they've done in 2022. So the fact that if we can get customers to a place where they're satisfied with the service product and in good dialogue with us on it, that takes a lot of the pressure out the STB. Bascome Majors : And maybe the longer-term part of that question over the next 12 to 18 months, where do you think they will focus most? And how do you make sure that your shareholders and customers' interest are protected there? Lance Fritz : Yes, Bascome. So what we keep an eye on are -- is the fulsome docket that they've got in front of them, things like final offer rate review versus this alternative dispute resolution mechanism, forced open access, the use of revenue adequacy as a rate-setting mechanism, those are things that we're working hard with the STB for them to understand what the ramifications of some of those decision points are, what is and is not justifiable by data and fact. And then, of course, we engage fulsomely with them to help make sure the regulation coming out of the STB makes sense and accomplishes what they're trying to accomplish, which is very good service product and growth in the rail industry. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Ari Rosa : Great. So really quickly, I was wondering what was the real estate transaction. Maybe you could give a bit of color on that? I don't think I saw it. And then, Lance, as you approach perhaps the final months, perhaps quarters of your time as CEO at UP, I was hoping you could just kind of take a bigger picture, step back and reflect on what are the accomplishments you're most proud of and how you think about where you'd like to see the future of the railroad go from here? And in particular, I was hoping you could touch on your thoughts on the ability of UP to grow volume and take share over the next five or 10 years. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. In terms of the real estate transaction, Ari, it was a fiber optics deal. Lance Fritz : And Ari, thank you very much for the question and the opportunity to reflect just a moment. If I look back over the last eight years now working on year nine, the thing I'm most proud of is what we as a team have accomplished in terms of moving our transmission plan to a PSR model, doing that over the course of the last four years and doing it in a way where our customers weren't damaged by the transition, they were benefited from it. I think we've done stupendous work on sustainability. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've done terrific work on diversity, equity and inclusion. We're recognized for that right now in the industry and in our communities. We've done really good work on setting ourselves up to be able to grow. We've got a wonderful stable of partners, IMCs that are world-class in hub, in Schneider and Knight-Swift and XPO in its current form. So I'm really, really pleased with that. As I look into the future, we are poised to be able to grow. We have to be consistent and reliable in our service product. That means we have to get our 5 critical resources right all the time. We got one of them wrong last year, part our issue and part the fact that the world blew up to a degree. But we have to be stable and consistent for our customers. They tell us they want that and they will grow with us as we deliver that. So I know the growth potential is there. Their supply chain want to use rail more, and the concept is really simple and straightforward. It's in our strategy, serve with consistent, reliable service, grow with service product and products that meet our customers' needs. Do that in a way where we are the provider of choice, the partner of choice that allows us to win in the marketplace and do it together with all four of our stakeholders being benefited from it. We think the strategy is sound, and we're ready and executing on it. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Jennifer, a couple of questions for you. Within the guidance that you're giving for a full year OR improvement, is that all just the mechanics of fuel? Or is there some improvement in the underlying business? And then as you think about comp from 2022 to 2023, on a full year basis, can you give us some sort of absolute numbers around inflation and what added cost is being put in there for PTO and additional enhancements to the compensation package? Jennifer Hamann : So in terms of our inflation guide, we said 4% was our inflation guide for 2023. And we said on the employee side, the comp would to be up mid-single digits. And those things still hold and that takes into account what we have negotiated for and plan to negotiate for in terms of paid sick leave. In terms of how we're going to get there and how we're going to improve, it really is the basis for the service product the pricing. Fuel will be a component. I mean, it obviously is a component in there. But we have the other levers, and that's where we're very much focused. Fuel is going to be what it's going to be. We're going to go after those items that we have the greater control over that's winning new business, pricing it appropriately and moving it efficiently. David Vernon : And then maybe, Eric, just as a quick follow-up, as you think about the FTE count for the full year, where are you sort of targeting the business to be at year-end 2023? Jennifer Hamann : I think Lance already answered that question. Our hiring levels for this year are roughly -- we came into the year assuming that they were going to be roughly similar to last year. Attrition is roughly similar in terms of what happens in the back half. We're really watching that from a volume standpoint. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Jairam Nathan : I just had a question on the EV penetration. And as -- do you need to -- does UP need to make investments given the fire risk of batteries within EVs? Kenny Rocker : I'll say that we have not seen that risk right now. We have very close relationship with the EV leaders we've enjoyed growth there. Our ramps are prepared to handle those EVs, and then we're looking at the forecast and the size and what we need to do anything from an investment perspective and make sure that we can efficiently move those off and on the ramp and do it faithfully. Lance Fritz : Yes. Jairam, I think fundamentally, the answer is we have not seen a shift in risk based on our shipments of EVs. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. Lance Fritz : And thank you, Rob, and thank you all for joining us today and for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with our owners again in May at our annual meeting. Until then, take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.  At this time, it's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by our newly elected Independent Chair of the Board of Directors, Mike McCarthy, who will take a couple of minutes to address the announcements we made this morning regarding my successor and our Board.  Mike, the floor is yours. Michael McCarthy : Thanks, Lance. This morning, the Board of Directors announced that Jim Vena will be appointed the next Chief Executive Officer of Union Pacific. The Board has also appointed Jim to the Board of Directors. Jim brings a strong rail operations background at Union Pacific with over 40 years of experience. This includes two successful years as our Chief Operating Officer from 2019 to 2020. After a comprehensive search process, it was clear Jim's track record of operating excellence was unparalleled and he was the right candidate for the job. Jim will start as CEO on August 14, and we look forward to welcoming him back to Union Pacific.  The Board also announced that Beth Whited will be appointed President of Union Pacific. Beth has over 35 years of experience at our company and has held leadership roles across multiple departments. Recently, she has led our strategy, sustainability and workforce resource teams with great success. Going forward, the operations, finance, marketing and sales, supply chain and technology functions will report directly to Vena. Whited will report to Vena, and her responsibilities will include the strategy, workforce resources, sustainability, law, corporate relations and government affairs functions.  In addition to these management changes, the Board is appointing two new Board members : Doyle Simons, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser; and John Wiehoff, former Chairman, President and CEO of C.H. Robinson. Both bring to our Board a wealth of skill sets, including operational expertise from leading large industrial public companies. As Lance indicated, as part of these changes, we are adopting a corporate governance best practice by splitting the role of company CEO and Board Chair. With my election, the Independent Chair, Director, Sheri Edison, will take over leadership of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee.  In addition, the Board has created a new committee, Safety and Service Quality, which will have responsibility to review, evaluate and monitor compliance with safety programs and provide oversight of the company's service performance. Director Jane Lute will lead this committee.  The Board is very pleased to make these announcements today, which represent a continued commitment to Board refreshment to ensure that we have the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the company. We are confident that these new appointments set Union Pacific up for long-term value creation.  Before I turn it back over to Lance, I would like to thank him for his leadership these past eight years. His accomplishments are many. And over the next few weeks, we will properly celebrate them. Most importantly, though, his leadership has set our company up for great success for the years to come. Thank you, Lance. And I'll turn it back over to you. Lance Fritz : Thanks, Mike. We appreciate your leadership throughout the process. And I'm pleased to welcome back Jim to Union Pacific, and I'm confident that the company has the right leaders to advance the hard work that's underway. Now let's turn to the business of the call and second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.93 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 63% was up 280 basis points versus 2022 primarily driven by lower revenue, inflationary pressures and the previously disclosed onetime ratification bonus payment.  Throughout the quarter, we provided our customers with a more consistent and reliable service product while generally meeting the demand that was available to us. Eric will discuss in more detail the progress we've made, but the bottom line is that the actions we've taken to strengthen our crew resources are improving the railroad.  We also acted during the quarter to increase the efficiency of our network by rightsizing our locomotive fleet using crews more efficiently and making sequential improvements in train length. We finished the quarter with our resources better aligned with current volumes.  As you'll hear from Kenny, while several of our markets showed growth, consumer-facing markets remained soft and drove the volume decline. However, the strength of our business development efforts enabled us to mitigate the macro impact and outperform our peers. So let me turn it over to Kenny to provide more color on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, volume was down 2% driven by weak market conditions in our premium and bulk business groups. Freight revenue declined 5% driven by lower fuel surcharges and a [2% decrease in volume. However, we generated solid core pricing gains in the quarter to help offset some of those challenges]. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 3% compared to last year, driven by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 1% decline in volume. Grain and grain products volume was up 1% due to increased demand and business wins for renewable diesel feedstocks, coupled with strong shipments of domestic grain. A soft U.S. export grain market partially offset these gains.  Fertilizer carloads decreased by 9% in the quarter due to an outage at a customer facility that reduced export potash shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced beer imports early in the quarter, but those shipments eventually improved by June. In addition, drought conditions from the prior growing season negatively impacted both fresh and can shipments.  And lastly, coal and renewables volume was flat year-over-year. Low natural gas prices and reduced electricity demand from mild weather negatively impacted shipments, but that was offset by a favorable comparison to 2022. With our service improvements and additional resources, we are currently meeting available demand.  Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was flat for the quarter driven by a 1% improvement in volume, offset by a 1% decline in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was up 2% year-over-year, driven by increased plastic shipments, partially offset by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production levels and reduced housing demand.  Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 2% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 13% year-over-year driven by challenging market conditions in housing and repair and remodel, coupled with lower corrugated box demand. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 2% versus last year driven by strong business development and increased demand for LPG and petroleum products. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 11% on a 4% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car decreased by 8%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenues. Automotive volumes were positively driven by continued strength in OEM production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts.  Domestic intermodal wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by higher inventory and the shift in consumer behavior as people spend more towards services than goods. International shipments were down due to decreased imports on the West Coast.  So turning to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities. There is uncertainty in our second half coal outlook as the inventories have been restocked, but extreme heat is driving up near-term demand and starting to push up natural gas prices. We expect near-term grain shipment to be challenged with tighter U.S. grain supply impacting volumes. However, with improved operations and recent rain improving new crop supply forecast, we remain optimistic about our opportunity to move incremental grain carloads in the fourth quarter.  In addition, we expect our forecast for biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to remain strong. We see solid market demand and continue to capture new business as production expands. Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023. Demand for forest products will also remain below 2022 levels. And despite some good business development wins on the metal side, it has been offset by a weaker-than-expected market. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction with new business wins. And finally, for premium. We expect challenges in the intermodal market from continued inventory destocking, inflationary pressures and ongoing shift in consumer spending from goods to services. However, on the international side, we continue to outpace U.S. West Coast import market as customers shift more business to IPI. For automotive, we expect growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and high shippable ground count. So to wrap up, it's hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities. The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals.  With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. As always, safety remains job #1 at Union Pacific, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Freight rail is the safest way to transport goods over land, and Union Pacific is doing its part to be even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology and communities. That is evidenced by our safety performance, which continues to show improvement.  Through the first half of the year, our reportable derailment rate and personal injury rate both improved, a direct result of our enhanced training programs and strong safety culture of ownership and personal accountability.  Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 10. This quarter, through the team's hard work, we made improvements both year-over-year and sequentially across key metrics that drive the customer experience. Freight car velocity improved 8% to 202 miles per day compared to the second quarter 2022. This improved fluidity and resiliency was on display as we exceeded 200 daily car miles for 10 consecutive weeks during the quarter.  While the current business mix is a headwind, there remain opportunities for continued improvement. Trip plan compliance cites sizable 17 and 8-point year-over-year improvement in intermodal and manifest and auto TPC, respectively. Improved network fluidity as evidenced by faster freight car velocity, train velocity and lower terminal dwell drove those improvements.  Turning to Slide 11 to review our network efficiency metrics. With the demand picture weaker, the team is taking action to right-size resources to align with current volumes. For example, beginning in April, we took actions to remove locomotives from our active fleet, storing around 200 units through the quarter. While there is still room for progress, locomotive productivity improved 2% both sequentially and year-over-year even as our gross ton miles declined 1%. Although greater crew availability is supporting solid service metrics, the impact of our hiring can be seen in our workforce productivity. To date, we have graduated approximately 1,200 TE&Y employees and have a strong pipeline of nearly 775 in training. These higher workforce levels, coupled with weaker volumes, resulted in a 5% decline in workforce productivity. However, with more crew resources, we were able to lower recrew rates and reduce our borrow-outs by roughly half during the quarter.  We continue to drive productivity with train length as evidenced by our sequential improvement of 2%. While down 1% year-over-year, this is good progress when you consider the headwinds soft intermodal was presented to our train length initiatives. There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad. From redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, growing train length and rightsizing our locomotive fleet, there is productivity to be captured.  Wrapping up on Slide 12. The well-being and quality of life for our employees remains a top priority, and we continuously collect feedback, collaborate and look for solutions with our workforce. The historic agreements listed on Slide 12 represent results of our work together. Let's talk through each one of them in detail.  Starting with paid sick leave. We now have ratified our tentative agreements with all 13 of our labor unions and this important quality-of-life initiative. The employee benefit is evident as they receive more paid time off to take care of themselves and their families. For the company, this definitely improves the attractiveness of our jobs but is additional labor expense that will need to be offset.  Next, our crew consent agreement with SMART-TD provides greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to redeploy break or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. More specifically, for our employees, it provides an expedited path for brake persons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they so desire.  For the company, it allows us to now reduce brake persons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demand. It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work. Finally, TE&Y work rest provides engineers and conductors with a more predictable work schedule, which enhances the quality of life for our employees and their families. Currently, we have a ratified agreement with our engineers that provides an 11 days on, 4 days off work schedule, and we are currently negotiating work rest with our conductors.  For the company, this enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable, available workforce. That reduces labor and failure costs, which combined support more consistent and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and loss productivity. Now these agreements come with a cost, which Jennifer will detail more later. As we implement them, we expect a larger training pipeline in the near term as well as elevated workforce levels in the future. When fully implemented, our current forecast is an additional 400 to 600 employees. Ultimately, the long-term benefit of these agreements is the positive impact on our employees and the service we provide for our customers. That enhanced service product will allow us to win in the marketplace. So to close, I would like to express my appreciation to both our customers for their support and the marketing and sales team for their continuous work to capture available demand and win in the new -- win new business.  With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk-down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14, where we've outlined the major drivers. In the June 13 8-K, we disclosed a onetime ratification payment related to our SMART-TD brake person agreement. That $67 million bonus increased our operating ratio 110 basis points and reduced our EPS $0.09.  Falling fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs positively impacted our operating ratio 200 basis points and added $0.04 to EPS. While improved operations generally allowed us to meet demand during the quarter, that demand was softer and the combination of an elevated training pipeline, inflation and negative mix, all impacted our core results. Below the line, we net to a $0.07 EPS reduction from lower Nebraska State tax rates in 2023, as was noted in that same June 8-K, and a large 2022 real estate sale.  Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6 billion, down 5% versus last year on a 2% year-over-year volume decline. Included in that is a $34 million reduction in accessorials related to lower intermodal volume and faster equipment turns.  Operating expense of $3.8 billion was flat resulting in second quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, which is down 12% versus last year. Other income decreased $70 million driven by the 2022 real estate sale I mentioned earlier. Interest expense increased 7%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 2022, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 12% decrease in earnings per share to $2.57.  Now looking more closely at our second quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.6 billion, down 5% versus 2022. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 175 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $707 million was $269 million less versus last year. The impact of falling fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenues 425 basis points.  The combination of price and mix in the quarter increased freight revenue 150 basis points. This gain reflects the strong pricing we secured while also recognizing some headwinds from certain coal and intermodal contracts where the pricing is more reflective of current market conditions. Mix in the quarter remained negative as fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments outweighed the positive impact of lower intermodal.  Turning now to Slide 17 and a look at second quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased $177 million versus 2022 with nearly 40% of that amount reflecting the brake person agreement. Second quarter workforce levels increased to 4%. Although total transportation employees were up 7%, the active TE&Y workforce is only up 1%, which is a result of our robust hiring and elevated training pipeline.  Excluding the impact of the onetime bonus payment, cost per employee increased 5% in the second quarter, and we expect it to be up 3% to 4% for the full year. Both second quarter and full year cost per employee reflect the impact of that larger training pipeline as well as better crew efficiency, which are partially offsetting wage inflation. I'll provide more details on the impact of our new agreements here in just a bit.  Fuel expense in the quarter increased 29% on a 29% decrease in fuel prices. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% driven by inflation, partially offset by decreased subsidiary drayage expense and more moderate locomotive repair expenses as we stored locomotives in the quarter. Equipment and other rents was up 8%, reflecting higher lease expense for new freight cars secured to support business volumes and lower equity income, slightly offset by lower car hire as we improve cycle times and move less volume. Other expense grew 6%, primarily related to increased environmental remediation accruals as well as persistently elevated casualty costs. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2023 decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was $445 million of payments related to labor union agreement. These payments also impacted free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate.  Year-to-date, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 200 -- excuse me, to 2022 levels at 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies.  Wrapping up on Slide 19. As you've heard from the team, we're pleased that the service product is enabling us to meet available demand. Unfortunately, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets like intermodal and lumber remains soft. Additionally, the outlook for coal has weakened since the start of the year but with some near-term opportunities given the extreme heat. Although we still expect to outpace industrial production in certain markets, weak demand for consumer goods has pushed our full year volume outlook below current industrial production estimates, which are slightly positive. Unchanged is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. To date, we've made great progress repricing our business to reflect the impact of higher inflation, and that momentum will continue.  As it relates to fuel prices, I should point out that the tailwind we've experienced these past 24 months is now expected to shift to a headwind both on the operating ratio and EPS front. Assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, this will likely represent a negative second half impact of around $0.50 per share. Eric provided some great context on our labor agreements. And although they clearly come with some upfront cost, we see opportunities as well. Starting with the sick leave agreements. Our current forecast is that they will add roughly $50 million to labor expense in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the cost per crew numbers I quoted earlier. We view these costs as added inflationary pressures that we will reflect in our pricing. For the brake person agreement, we've already seen the impact of that upfront payment. Our expected payback period is roughly two years as it allows us to redeploy crew personnel, save on costly borrow-out positions as well as reduce our current hiring needs. Implementation of the BLET work rest agreement will start over the next month or so with completion likely in 2024. For this year, we estimate the work rest implementation will cost upwards of $20 million.  The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don't yet have an agreement with SMART-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout. And while we certainly expect better availability, better service and more flexibility with our crew boards, providing more access to time off likely adds employees and expense. The exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroad.  Looking at our 2023 capital allocation. Our capital plan remains $3.6 billion. We also plan to maintain our current dividend of $1.30 per quarter as reflected in our dividend announcement this morning. However, we have paused share repurchases and don't expect to be back in the market for the remainder of 2023.  While there's no change to our long-term capital allocation strategy, which is first dollar into the business, industry-leading dividend payment and excess cash to shares, we recognize our cash flows are impacted in the current environment with volumes and costs.  Wrapping up, we are well positioned to operate a better railroad in the second half of 2023 and for the long term, our strong fundamentals are unchanged and will allow us to generate significant value for our owners as team UP drives service, growth and improved profitability.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As you've heard from the team, the first half of this year has been about laying a foundation for future success. Key to that foundation is safety and the quality of life of our employees, and I'm pleased with the progress we've been making on both those fronts.  As you heard from Eric, we continue to make the railroad safer, while improvements in our safety metrics are critical. More encouraging are the positive strides we're making in our safety culture. The team has great momentum across our safety programs, which gives me great pride as I step away.  I'm also encouraged by the progress we've made to address quality-of-life issues with our craft professionals, reaching historic labor agreements around paid sick leave, crew redeployment and scheduled work. These agreements drive employee engagement and productivity to produce a better service product for our customers.  As I wrap up time as CEO of Union Pacific, I'd like to express my deep appreciation to the Board and shareholders of UP for giving me the privilege of leading the company for the past eight years. I'm proud of how the team has positioned Union Pacific to thrive for the years ahead, and I'm pleased to say that we provided great value all along the way. Union Pacific is truly a special place. It's full of hard-working, dedicated railroaders who embrace the daily task of Building America. It's been my greatest honor to lead this team. Their commitment to be the best for our communities, our customers, our investors and for each other is remarkable. 160-plus years of success began and continues with our exceptional employees. I can't wait to see what they accomplish next. Jennifer Hamann : Thank you, Lance. And on behalf of the employees of Union Pacific, let me offer our gratitude and appreciation for your leadership. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you embark on the next chapter.  Before we begin Q&A, I'd like to lay out a couple of guidelines for the call. In the interest of time and to accommodate everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one question only. Second, we understand that there's great interest in the leadership changes that were announced this morning, and we look forward to those discussions. However, today's call is to discuss our quarterly results. So please focus your questions on the business of the earnings call.  So with that, Rob, we are ready for your first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Just want to talk through intermodal. I know there's obviously consumer weakness there. But is that -- I guess, the pace of the decline moderating for you some? And I guess, with sort of the improved service that you're starting to see in that interest back on the West Coast port, should we start to see or expect to see some of those business wins start to accelerate for you? Just any color just thinking that maybe intermodal starts to perform better for you in the face of even the consumer declines? Kenny Rocker : Allison, you look at it, I'll let you know, we're really staring down at consumer spending. And it's been flat last few months, maybe several months. But it's differentiated as you look at goods versus services, we're clearly seeing, and I talked about it in my opening remarks, less on the goods and more on the services.  The other thing that we're looking is just what's happening with demand, and we're looking at that in terms of some of the contract rates would better flatten out in the spot rates that have inched up a little bit. The fact that we have a really strong intermodal service product is a benefit for us. We're encouraged as a company, I'm encouraged as the commercial leader that even though the imports have been down 23% year-to-date, we're only down a couple of percentage points.  And talking to our customers, we also believe that they will be shifting a little bit more back to the West Coast port. That's going to be a gradual shift. That will be a little bit more throughout 2023 and probably into 2024. But clearly, we're positioned here for the upside. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : I'm not sure this is for Jennifer or Kenny. But Jennifer, you mentioned in your comments you're making great progress in repricing business to some of these inflationary headwinds that you're facing. Can you give us an idea as to, one, kind of where you stand in repricing the book of business to a lot of these new labor deals? And kind of just in a softer macro backdrop, how these conversations are going and your confidence in your ability to fully offset the cost? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Jon, thanks for that question. I'll start and then pitch it to Kenny. So just as a reminder, when you think about our book of business, call it, 25% or so is spot rates. You've got another, call it, 30%, 35% or so that is one year or less in duration types of contracts or arrangement, and the rest then are multiyear deals. So there is a cadence to which we're able to touch actively all of our business.  Kenny, do you want to maybe talk about the market? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Jon, the commercial team has done an excellent job articulating the need for some of the inflationary pressures even if you want to call it the labor priors that are there and really inserting our service product along with those discussions.  Now candidly, in a very pragmatic way, our customers empathize with that. They are taking the same price increases in their markets. So they understand what we need to accomplish. There's a tremendous amount of resources that were committed to on the CapEx side, which will help out with a consistent and reliable service. So we feel very good. There's full confidence and price and above inflation in making sure we cover those costs. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Congrats, Lance on the next stage of your career here. I guess wanted to take a minute and talk a little bit about sort of resources and where you think you are. I know, Eric, you talked about pulling some cost levers that were around locomotives and other assets. But Jennifer, what should we expect with head count as we move forward? And sort of when are you appropriately staffed for what you think the volume outlook might be, not just for this quarter but maybe the next several quarters? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So I'll maybe let Eric talk about how he feels about crew staffing levels. But just overall, in terms of our head count, we think as you look to the back half of the year, it's probably going to be, I'll call it, flattish or so from where we're at right now. We're continuing to hire and train and make sure that we've got a good robust pipeline so that we're able to serve our customers appropriately. But just from an absolute FTE basis, that's kind of how we see things in the back half. Eric Gehringer : Yes. And just picking up from there, Chris. Clearly, what you've seen in our performance is that we have reduced the amount of hiring that we've been doing now. We stay very connected with Kenny as in his outlook, both for the fourth quarter as well as 2024, and we're going to continue to adjust as we have to what that demand is.  It's the same way I view the locomotive work that was accomplished during the quarter. And the team stored 200 locomotives. And if you actually look for now and this month, we're actually above 200. We're treating it the exact same way. So the demand that's out there, find your resource base accordingly. Lance Fritz : We should be crystal clear as well, Jennifer and Eric, Chris, that there's still work to be done. When we look into the third and fourth quarter, Eric outlined some of it in his prepared comments, but we are not yet volume-variable with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We took a step towards that in the second quarter. We got to keep taking steps in the third and fourth. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : Lance, congrats from my end as well. I wanted to ask a question about the outlook for the second half. You mentioned fuel being a headwind and in addition to that, the labor cost. Do you think EPS in the second half will be lower than the first half? And then maybe, Jennifer, you could comment on the run rate for these labor-related costs as we move into 2024. I'm just curious if we can take this $50 million to $70 million and annualize it or if that is expected to change? Lance Fritz : Jennifer, why don't I start? We're not going to provide some incremental or new guidance as regards earnings into the back half. But Jennifer, you did a good job of outlining what the headwinds are, and why don't we unpack that a little bit? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, certainly, the one headwind we did size for you is the $0.50 impact, the negative year-over-year impact we expect to see on EPS from fuel in the third and fourth quarters. In terms of moving into 2024, so if you think about that $50 million from the sick leave agreements that I mentioned, most of those agreements were really effective in the second half. We had our non-ops that started a little bit in the first half. So I think you can think about that as being something that will carry over and repeat itself in the first half of 2024.  Beyond that, in terms of the implementation of work rest, we're really reluctant to -- and really, it would be difficult for us to size that more precisely because it is going to depend on the timing of how we roll that out as well as the employee behavior that we see with that. And so that's something that we'll just keep you updated, but I want to make sure you do understand that, that will be a bit of a headwind. But as we get greater clarity of that as we go through our rollout and start that rollout and obviously, we still need to get SMART-TD done as well, we'll be in conversation about that. Lance Fritz : So Justin, I think as we look into the back half of this year, improving productivity, the hiring pipeline tones down a little bit, but we're still hiring. It probably looks like year-over-year about equal, I think, is what Jennifer was saying.  Not sure what's going on in the marketplace. So we got to we've got to do everything we can to capture all the business that's available to us. And then fuel is going to be a real headwind in the back half. Offsetting that, we get a tailwind from implementing the brake person agreement. And as we implement the work rest schedule, I am confident that generates both productivity and service product improvement. The issue is timing and magnitude. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Lance, congrats on career here. And I guess, I know you guys want to ask about the quarter, but just looking back, Lance, over your course of being at Union Pacific, what do you think went really right? And what do you think maybe could have been done better to keep track maybe with potentially more volume growth looking back?  And maybe looking forward, what do you think are the biggest challenges or opportunities for the industry, maybe not even just UNP? The technology, is it regulation, is it M&A? Would love to get your thoughts. Lance Fritz : Yes, Brandon, thank you for that question. And we'll try to keep this to be the only question on that. So I'll try to make the answer fulsome. In terms of what am I proud of, what did I think we got right as a team, one is I love the team that we've assembled. It's world-class. I love the work that we've done on sustainability. I love the fact that we are an inclusive workforce. You can see it in our Board. You can see it on our management team. I like the progress that we've made on safety. We've got more to do there. And I love the fact that we transitioned from our previous transportation model and way of running the railroad to a PSR model that's a better service product for our customers.  In terms of what we needed to do better, we were not consistent and reliable through my 8.5 years of serving as the Chairman, President and COO. And that needs to be remedied. As we look into the future, that's exactly what we need to continue to do. We've got a strategy, serve, grow, win together, that's built off the foundation of consistent and reliable service.  I am confident we're oriented, organized and capable of doing that. We've got to prove it to our customers. Because Brandon, our customers tell us, as we demonstrate reliability, there's more of their order book available to us, plus there's more market participants that will start doing business with us. That's the unlock for growth. And growth is the unlock for significant value creation in the future for everybody, for all of our stakeholders. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Again, from me as well, congrats, Lance, on a great career. Just on the volume guide itself, can you confirm just how much that kind of volume outlook did move? Because you did -- you're now going to be kind of below a raised benchmark. So just trying to get a sense of kind of how much that did move.  And also, is industrial production the right benchmark for your kind of volume growth in the long term just given the consumer exposure here? Or do we have to look at some combination of IP plus GDP? Lance Fritz : Jennifer, do you want to start that? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, I can start it. So you raised a good point, Ravi. I mean we do think looking backwards certainly that industrial production has been a better gauge. But you're right, we have great franchise diversity, which we've talked to and Kenny mentioned too. And with the growing intermodal portfolio, there are certainly components of that. But it's really driven by consumer spending, and a lot of that consumer spend on industrial production. So it's hard to really separate from that.  But in terms of what's changed from where we started the year, certainly, coal is something that with natural gas prices falling as it did late January, early February, that certainly took a big chunk of that demand away from us. Now you've heard us talk about the heat and you're seeing that, you're seeing maybe a little bit of inflection in natural gas prices. So we're watching that.  The other piece, though, is on that consumer side. Onboarding a new intermodal customer coming into the year, we expected that to be a big tailwind to our volumes. And just the way that, that consumer spending and consumer goods purchases has dropped, that's just had a really outsized impact. Kenny Rocker : All I'll say is that we're looking at consumer spending by the week. And I feel very encouraged that we have onboarded over the last couple of years a couple of transformative customers on to our domestic intermodal network. And so as we see that movement move up, we're in a great position. And so that's encouraging for us as a company. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : First, just wanted to follow up on price to the labor inflation. Do you think getting rate is enough to offset those costs? Do you need to get some productivity benefits from the work rest, the brake men and then possibly, even the utility rule? And then just for Kenny, can you just comment more about price/mix? You mentioned specifically the coal and intermodal pricing were resetting lower in the quarter. Does that continue throughout the rest of the year? You can give some parameters in terms of how to think about that plus mix in the back half. Lance Fritz : Kenny, why don't I start with the -- what about the agreements and getting price and productivity out of them. The short answer, Brian, is we are confident that we can continue to price above inflation. We've just seen a few agreements like paid sick leave add to the inflation in our comp and benefits. And Kenny's team is tasked now to get out there and make sure that we recoup that.  In terms of productivity, the brake person agreement is just a clear path on productivity. We can reduce 3 people to 2 people on crews where we don't need 3 people, and we can either redeploy them or lower our hiring demands. So that clearly, just in that one example -- there are other examples like in work rest, Brian, we'll be able to get productivity out of that.  Today, there's a percentage of our workforce when they're called to take a train, they are not available to us. And we don't know that before we call them. And that creates failure cost and disruption in the network. I'm going to presume, and I think the experience where work rest schedules are in place, that unpredictability dropped dramatically. When that happens, we get better the utilization of our assets and we lower failure costs from the network. So the only question for us is order of magnitude and when as we implement. Kenny Rocker : So yes, a couple of things here. Let's just take hold for first up. Yes. And you've heard us talk about this. We do have a couple of mechanisms that are in place that allow us and our customers to be competitive with natural gas prices. One of the things that we have seen out there is the fact that there has been a little slight uptick in terms of demand based on the extreme heat that we've seen. We've seen that also impact again in the near term natural gas prices out there. So we're seeing more demand out there.  We're working closely with Eric and his team as we speak to add more sets and add more inventory into the network. And we're looking at the 4 curves that you just see, how long that will last. So we're always looking at that, and we're looking at that by the week.  Switching to domestic intermodal on the pricing side. we like the fact that we have our customers that are competitive in the marketplace and that we're competitive against truck. Some of those mechanisms will go up, I think, tightened in a Loup market like where we are now, it might move down a little bit. But the key is to make sure that we can capture the volume against truck and make sure that we're competitive. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital. Fadi Chamoun : Congratulations, Lance. Question on the opportunity for volume. Like if you think about a zero GDP environment over the next, say, 12 months, what can service improvement deliver in terms of growth? Where are maybe some of the verticals you think that you can make a difference in the service level and ultimately start to see more idiosyncratic opportunities to grow the business? Kenny Rocker : Yes, Fadi, thanks for the question. Let's just walk through -- if you look at our outlook slide, and I'll supplement that with a few more specifics on our biodiesel, the renewable diesel market, we've got seven different facilities on us. We're going to land another facility here by the end of the year. We're very encouraged by that. That's a key part of our growth strategy. And we mentioned that a couple of years ago, during Investor Day, very proud of our commercial team for securing that.  Construction, our rock business, for example, those are areas where Eric's team is just delivering great service, and it's showing up in terms of carloads. We're adding a few more sets there. We're seeing more carloads that are coming on because of that, and some of that is market-related. There's just more infrastructure that's out there.  If you talk about the service product, we look at auto parts coming out of Mexico. We've seen a pretty fast and upcoming grower -- growing EV producer that we're growing with on the auto parts side that we're excited about. We've secured a new automotive OEM on our line back in the spring that has brought business to us. That same OEM will be bringing on business in the first quarter. So we're pretty excited there.  And then kind of last but not least, I'll just say that overall, the team has been engaged on bringing new business in different ways. We have a new industrial park that's going to be landing on us in the Buckeye, Arizona area. So that's great. And we've got a customer that will be doing reusable plastics, so just you think about the ESG connection. So we can create our own business development with the service that I mentioned with Eric, and we're excited about it. Lance Fritz : And it's proven, Kenny, your BD pipeline is up, what? Kenny Rocker : It's up around 20% to 25%. So the team is just doing a fabulous job going out there and expanding the market better. Lance Fritz : And that's in a down volume market. Kenny Rocker : That's in a down market. And so I will say we're pumped up about it. Lance Fritz : That's good. Fadi Chamoun : And I'm surprised you didn't mention intermodal as being one of the opportunities that service gets better. Is this because the truck market competitiveness right now? You need a little bit of support there? Or is there more to it than that? Kenny Rocker : Okay. Well, you're going to get me riled up today. So first of all, we talked about a couple of transformative wins that we feel good about. I'll tell you, as a management team, bringing on Inland Empire, which is a new product, bringing on a new Port Houston service product that Eric has given us with 5 new lanes, bringing on Twin Cities. Absolutely, we feel good about domestic intermodal. At some point, you need demand to be there. What you're hearing me say is that we're prepared as that demand comes on. And we're adding new products, we're adding new services, we're adding new customers. We're excited. Lance Fritz : Kenny, at the risk of making this drag on too long, you should mention Falcon Premium too. Kenny Rocker : So let me back up and just say there's been a lot of debate out there, Lance, in the marketplace. And we feel very good about the service products that we have with Falcon Premium. On a broader sense, there are other Class 1s associated with that. So it's not just one Class 1. It's the other Class 1s that we're interacting with too that we feel good about. We've got a shorter route structure. We've got a better schedule. We've got the relationship with the customers. Eric and his team are continuously improving that service product. So we're encouraged how that looks in the future. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Lance, congrats all your success. Wish you the best. I guess, Eric and Jennifer, I know borrow-outs have been pretty expensive. And I think last time we checked, you had like 250 borrow-outs in the network. Can you just give us an update on that? It feels like maybe that's an opportunity over the next six to nine months.  And just generally, in terms of nonfuel costs, it feels like the network is running a little bit heavy on nonfuel costs. I know there's obviously cost inflation and labor inflation, some idiosyncratic things. But as maybe the volume comes back and you can come much more volume-variable, is there an opportunity to kind of hold the line on the nonfuel cost structure given some of the positive things that you can do on the borrow-outs and kind of other cost items that are proving more stubborn right now? Eric Gehringer : Yes. Thank you for the question. Let's back up in time, as we came into the year when we think about our first quarter earnings report, we were talking about borrow-outs. In the context of while we were making great progress in our hiring, we still have pockets of the system, specifically about 7 locations, where we were utilizing borrow-outs because of the difficulty to hire.  Now in any given year, there's some level of borrow-outs used even in just dealing with seasonality, for example, the grain harvest that comes in the fall. If you look at the quarter, what we've reported is that we've taken our borrow-out count down by 50%, approximately. Now that is a process that continues. As we look for volume to continue to grow, we have those as options. But as we're looking every week, to your point, to control our cost, those are ones that we adjust literally on a weekly basis.  There may be a place as we fast-forward three months, four months, six months, where you may use them and very small numbers. But our goal is to reduce our borrow-outs as quickly as we possibly can.  As far as the nonfuel cost, it follows the same recipe that we've shared before, One, we just finished talking about it, which is how we think about our labor costs and ensuring that we're being conscious of that. Two, you go to your next expensive cost or, at least outside of fuel, is you're going to look at your locomotive fleet. The reduction that we've made in the quarter is a strong move in the right direction. The reduction we've been made in July is another strong move on top of that, and we look forward to reporting to that in future quarters. So all eyes on we want to grow the business, and we need to be volume-variable until we see more of that growth coming. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And Amit, just to build on what Eric is saying there is, if you look across all of our cost categories, setting depreciation side, we know we have opportunities within all of those to be more efficient. As we continue to improve cycle times, that has a very direct flow-through in terms of our car hire expenses on the purchased services and materials side.  Eric mentioned the locomotives, but there's other opportunities we have in there to work on our cost. And even comp and benefits with some of the headwinds that we know we have, there's opportunities to be more productive and use that crew base more efficiently.  And to your point, volume can certainly be a friend when it comes to the cost structure. But I think the fact that you've seen us make some progress as volumes are going down, and you saw us build train length even as volumes came down and in particular, intermodal volume, those are the things that we're going to keep working on here -- well, always, but certainly in the back half of the year to continue to drive better efficiency and get better alignment between the resources and the cost structure and the volumes that we're moving. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Lance, as you wrap up your eight years as UP's Chairman, President, and CEO, how do you expect the push and pull of the senior decision-making process between marketing operations and HR change with those roles split between 3 people and Beth elevated from just leaving the HR and sustainability efforts into that newly stand-alone President position? Lance Fritz : Yes, Bascome, thanks for the question. First, you got to note, Jim Vena is our CEO. He runs the company, that reports to Jim. So I don't anticipate any meaningful dislocations or push-pull created by org structure. And having said that, there's some natural creative tension in the business all the time. There's creative tension between the operating team and the commercial team. There can be creative tension between the team that is controlling versus the team that's spending.  Just -- you can name any number. The most important thing is we've got a fabulous operating executive joining us as our CEO. He's got a great track record, and he's going to be laser-focused on making sure that we're providing the best service product to our customers so that we can translate it into growth. He's going to do a very good job of making sure the team works together.  We're working well together today. I anticipate we'll be working well together a month from now. And Beth's role is going to be making sure that she's supporting all of that effort effectively through workforce resources through the work we do with communities, through the work we do in DC. So I anticipate better, not worse, as we move forward. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Congrats on its team and the Board on the next steps and on naming Jim as CEO. So many moving parts with the labor agreements. Obviously, Jen ran through some of the cost side from the pay increase last year to what you're now adding on after the main contracts. Maybe -- can you take a minute, walk us through some of the benefits that you see?  And I presume these are all Union Pacific add-ons. Maybe differentiate what is UP add-on versus the industry. And then just thoughts on your outlook. I think you removed the operating ratio from your target. Is there a thought on the scale that you want to put together on costs? Or are we just leaving that off all together? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So I'll start off, Ken. So when we did our 8-K in June, we took the operating ratio improvement off the table for the year, and that hasn't changed. Certainly, you heard us talk about some of the headwinds that we have. So we are not -- with the addition of the labor expenses, volumes moving away from us and then obviously, some fuel headwinds relative to OR in the back half of the year, we don't expect year-over-year improvement. Our task, and I kind of touched on this a little bit with the question from Amit, is to get better from where we sit today. And I'm not going to forecast what our OR is going to be in the back half of the year, but we're going to work really hard to improve each and every day. And that's both in terms of being more productive with that cost structure as well as going out and selling in the marketplace and doing all we can to drive profitability on that side.  I don't know, Eric, you want to... Eric Gehringer : Yes. And on the agreement side, so if we start with sick days, the opportunity that Lance mentioned obviously reinforce as we see the opportunity to improve the attractiveness of our jobs. And as a result of that, that can have a positive impact on how we do our hiring.  If you go to the brake person deal, clearly, the biggest opportunity there is to reduce brake person labor in line with where the jobs are no longer needed and also allows us to partially offset some of our hiring in the short term. And of course, we get the benefit of establishing a ground-based enhanced utility position.  And as Jennifer pointed out, the payback period on that is approximately two years. And if you look right now, we're about 60% of the way through that implementation. And then certainly on the 11 and 4 scheduled work, it really boils down to improved availability, as Lance pointed out, and more efficiently managing our staff levels with more latitude on how we do that under this new agreement. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Best of luck to you, Lance. Jennifer, Just wanted to just make sure I understood the answer to that last question. Are you -- so relative to like the 62% adjusted OR in Q2, are you not -- you're just not giving any color? Or are you saying it's probably going to get worse, the OR second half versus at 62%? I'm just not sure what you're trying to message there.  And then just Kenny, CN last night was just -- talked about raising their expectations for the U.S. grain -- upcoming U.S. grain harvest just with some better rain recently. Just your thoughts on how you think about the grain harvest in your territory going forward? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So going back to -- you're really asking a sequential question. And again, I -- we had a 63% reported OR. If you're stripping out the brake person agreement, that was 1.1 points in the quarter. If you look at what we have done historically as a company, you tend to see some of your better margins in the third quarter, tends to go up a little bit then in the fourth quarter when you're just thinking about kind of that normal seasonality.  We are going to work to make sequential improvement. I'm not telling you that we're making sequential improvement, but that is the task that has to be ahead of us. We have to work to improve the cost structure. And we've already made some progress. I think you certainly saw that. I know it's a little bit of a messy quarter with all that was going on in it. But when you strip some of the noise out, there was -- particularly when you're comparing first quarter to second quarter, we did make gains, not year-over-year but sequentially, we did make some gains there. So I think that's the way to think about it into the back half of this year. Kenny Rocker : So Scott, I'd tell you, we look at the weekly crop report and, call it five, maybe six weeks ago, wasn't looking great. And since then, we've had rain in areas that we serve and participate in. So it's looking much better. You heard in my comments that we think there is an opportunity for incremental grain in the fourth quarter. And so we're steering that down and working with Eric's team to make sure we can capture it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Walter Spracklin : Best of luck there, Lance, on the future. Just a question here -- wrap up here on coal. I know you'd indicated that, that was an area of discrepancy from where you were looking at before. Really on the -- or the revenue per carload revenue per RTM, that's taken a notable step-down. And I know your peers talked a lot about -- you talked about a 15% decline in their rates on coal. Now a lot of that is tied to export met, which is not in your mix, but you did see a similar type of step-down in sense per RTM. Just wondering if that's something that you expect to continue for the foreseeable future. What's driving it? What could make it change up or down from this point going forward? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So Walter, we did mention that in my prepared remarks that, that was a bit of a headwind. And you've heard us talk before that we do have a portion of our coal contracts that have some mechanisms that link that pricing to natural gas pricing. And with what's happened with natural gas pricing, that certainly is flowing through in terms of some of the rates. We did that similar to intermodal in terms of keeping competitiveness for those players that are dispatching into the grid, keeping them competitive. And we're continuing to ship coal. Still profitable for us, but there is some pricing differentials there.  So it really depends on how you see the rest of the year playing out in terms of how that's going to look. But if you just compare last year's nat gas prices to where we're at this year, that tells you there's going to be some ongoing pressure there. Lance Fritz : Yes. I think the differentiation there is sequential versus year-over-year, and year-over-year is going to continue to see some pressure. Sequential, we've seen as much pressure as we're going to see. Walter Spracklin : So kind of flat from this point going forward? Jennifer Hamann : It should be. I mean, obviously, watch natural gas prices. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Jason Seidl : First off, Lance, good luck in the future, and congrats to both Jim and Beth, if they're listening in. Some quick things. I wanted to look a little bit about regulation. We've seen the FRA now is looking for a public comment period on train weights and lengths. Wanted to know if you guys think this is sort of a precursor for more regulation from them. And two, maybe if you could talk a little bit about anything anticipated on reciprocal switching. And lastly, squeezing in here, Jennifer, when was the last time you guys didn't repurchase shares in the quarter? Lance Fritz : Jennifer, you want to go first, then I'll take the others? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So I would go back to second and third quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit and there was such a drop in volumes. We paused our share repurchases then for at least a couple -- I'm pretty sure for the full second quarter, part of the third quarter, I think, is when we restarted that. So we manage the share repurchase piece with our excess cash. And that's always been the flexible part of our shareholder return, and that's how we're managing it today. Lance Fritz : Yes. And Jennifer, we've been crystal clear that we turbocharged our excess cash by using the capacity of our balance sheet. And that capacity now has been largely used, and it's all about growing cash from operations and operating income at this point. Jennifer Hamann : Exactly, Lance. And obviously, with some of the earnings pressures we're facing this year, that's not giving us that incremental capacity we've seen. Lance Fritz : So Jason, talking about what's going on in Congress and at the STB in Congress, the Rail Safety Act, we've been crystal clear about things in there that we think are appropriate. Like there should be additional regulation and laws regarding the preparedness of emergency responders, the information that's at their disposal. We believe the same is true on tank car standards. There's an opportunity to pull forward tank car standard improvements. And we also think there's room for regulation to step into wayside detection. We've done a ton of things in wayside detection voluntarily. It is not regulated. And if it were to be regulated appropriately, that makes some sense.  There's some things in the Rail Safety Act that don't make sense like coupling train size with safety. On our railroad, mainline and siding derailments are down 25% plus, while train size is up 20% over the last, call it, four years. There's just no correlation in our experience between safety and train size.  And likewise, there's no correlation anywhere in the world between train crew size and safety. That should be left to collective bargaining and what technology enables. So as we look at Congress, that's what we're thinking about. As we look at the STB, as we've said before, we help them understand how the railroad industry works, how our reinvestment works. And when it comes to reciprocal switch or forced open access, we help them understand that, that would have a real negative impact on investment. It would not improve service product, and they should be very, very careful as they think about whether or not that should be implemented and how to implement it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Lance, wanted to wish you well in the next thing you do, retirement, whatever it is. Let's see. I guess one just clarification. I think, Kenny, you commented earlier on intermodal yields are -- 3Q, are we expecting more sequential pressure on revenue per car in intermodal in 3Q? So that -- just a clarification.  And then the broader question really -- when we look at the industry, I think historically, there was opportunity from productivity and price to improve margins. Certainly, UP did that in a massive way over, I don't know, 15 years, right? But it just seems like there's this inflation in the cost base and pricing's good, but not enough. So do you think it's fair to look forward and say, look, margin improvement is really about volume and without volume, you're -- maybe you have a tough time to improve the margin? And I think that seemed to be true maybe for industry, not just for UP, but I don't know if you have thoughts on that. And then maybe the clarification on intermodal. Lance Fritz : Yes, Tom, let me start with your essential question about the three legs of the stool. We've forever talked about, we drive margin improvement through productivity, price and the benefit of volume. And to your point, we've leaned heavily on productivity and price historically. And we said we're in a transition where we're going to have to lean more heavily on volume.  But that's not going to be the only leg of that three-legged stool, Tom, when you -- it's still true. While inflation got on us quick, the way our contracts and our business relationships are set, it takes us a while to recoup that inflation through price. Kenny's team has been crystal clear that they own the requirement to do that, and they're following through. But it's going to take a little while. And on productivity, like we just demonstrated this quarter, we created a new agreement, makes all the sense in the world. It came with a 70 -- roughly $70 million price tag immediately. Implementing it is going to get the payback and will be paid back in about two years. So Tom, the opportunity for productivity, price and volume to still drive margin improvement exists. We're in kind of a unique environment right now regarding timing. And we are, for sure, going to have to rely on volume more heavily going forward. Kenny Rocker : Yes. Just a short answer. No, we're not expecting increased pricing pressures on that intermodal side of the house. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So you think stable revenue per car 3Q versus 2? Kenny Rocker : That's how you should be thinking about it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Ben Nolan : So Kenny, you mentioned the Falcon Express a little bit ago. I'm curious if you have any early takes. Any -- how are things thus far developing the way that they thought you would or you thought they would? Or any early indications that -- of how you're expecting it to play out over the back half of the year? Kenny Rocker : I think you're asking, have we seen any success stories? And yes, we've had some early wins. Of course, the focus is over the road. I mean that's the size of the prize. Rail is a very small part of that traffic that's moving out of Mexico or into Mexico. As I also said, as we continue to improve the speed and consistency there, we expect to make more inroads. Ben Nolan : Okay. And so far, as expected? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I mean we're getting more reception from customers that are open to opening their books and giving us a shot, for sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Lance, congratulations and good luck. So Eric, with the 400 to 600 heads that we need to add in for the part time off or paid time-off agreements, how many of those people are going to be on property by the end of this year? And then how should we think about reconciling that with the -- a flat head count number from 2Q? Are we making reductions in operations? Or is it coming out of other areas? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. So I'll actually jump in on that one. So it is -- when you think about the 400 to 600 incremental that we talked about from the labor agreements, that's incremental from what we would have otherwise been staffing at a given volume level. So that is completely consistent with and taken into account with when we also say, as we look at head count levels now to the end of the year, we think not a whole lot of change. So... Lance Fritz : So Jennifer, it's for all agreements? Jennifer Hamann : And it's for all agreements, which, again, we're going to be implementing over not just the back half of this year but well into 2024. Eric Gehringer : I think we also pointed out in our commentary that, that number is going to be highly impacted by the behavior that comes from these agreements. And we're not ready today to say exactly what that will look like. We'll continue to look to it, though. Jennifer Hamann : Absolutely. Lance Fritz : But he had the back half of his question there, which was about offsets and... Eric Gehringer : Yes. The offsets really haven't changed from the ones that I answered a few moments ago. They really focused on the availability on the 11 and 4 and they focus on the brake person about actually removing brake persons off of positions that are no longer needed. David Vernon : So if you were to say like how much of the 400 to 600 is in this year versus coming into next year, is it a quarter, is it half? Is there a way to directionally sort of indicate how much is going to be in this year? Jennifer Hamann : Again, it does depend on what the behavior is. But there will be some amount, maybe 0.25 to 0.50. That's probably not a bad estimate. Sick leave, obviously, that part we have fully done now. So any heads that we think that we need to add for that, that's done.  Obviously, we get offsets this year too with the brake person agreement. So there's a bit of a netting effect. And then it really is pace and timing of the BLET work rest, getting SMART-TD. And of course, we will -- because it's really the training piece of it, right? So we're going to need to -- for BLET, we need to put more engineers in the training pipeline. And with that, you need to continue to hire some conductors. So there will be some portion, 50% might be at the max side, I would say, but probably somewhere in there is a safe bet. Lance Fritz : And Jennifer, I think you had said this, but your total guidance sequentially for the back half labor being flattish includes all that. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, it absolutely includes all of that. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : More of an operational question. Curious, trip plan compliance, where do you think that needs to go both at the manifest intermodal level, but specifically on intermodal. Is the way to think about intermodal conversion accelerating tied to a certain level of trip plan compliance for that? And if so, where do customers really take note and you start to see an acceleration of market share gains? Eric Gehringer : Yes. Thank you for the question, Jordan. So when you -- we've been very consistent. And when you think about the intermodal TPC, you're talking about a number that starts with an 8. And when you're thinking about manifest and autos, it starts with the 7. Now that's highly informed and continues to be evolving. We went through a very large engagement with our customer base through Kenny's team towards the back end of last year that is informed this year and how we think about that, more specifically to segments within those customers.  Now that work continues because -- and as we've reinforced before, we know that our customers are sensitive, in fact, very sensitive to our service. That's why we're encouraged by the progress we made. And in no way are we saying that our service is where it needs to be now. It was a great step in the right direction. We've got more work to do. Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jordan, and thank you all for your questions, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest and your ownership in Union Pacific, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all participants will be in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation will be available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena, you may now begin. Jim Vena : Rob, thank you very much, and good morning, and good morning to everyone that's joined us, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's Third Quarter Results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker and our Executive Vice President of Operations; Eric Gehringer. It's been a busy couple of months since we joined in Union Pacific. I'm very excited to be back to come back to work with over 40 years of railroading experience, including two years here at UP. I know this railroad, I understand the opportunity. To win, you need a strong management team, the right culture, and a great franchise, and that's the goal, win and be the best in the industry. Since I started, I've spoken with employees, customers, regulators, community officials and investors. And my message has been consistent. It starts with safety. Our goal is to be the safest railroad in North America. That's the standard we should set for ourselves. We also expect to be the best in service and operational excellence. Service is delivering what we sold to our customers. Operational excellence is using our resources and assets as efficiently as possible. It's being mindful of our cost and developing our people. A key early initiative of mine is to drive decision-making lower in the organization. This means reducing layers and simplifying how we work. We need to deliver value with speed. This is a cultural change to empower our people. We recognize that our business volumes fluctuate and weather presents its challenges. So we will always keep a buffer of resources to manage those situations. This commitment to safety, service and operational excellence will lead to growth. And for you, our owners, that generates industry-leading returns. There's work to be done, but the entire team understands our strategy for success. Now let's discuss third quarter results, starting on slide three. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $2.51 per share. This compares to 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. Our third quarter operating revenue declined 10%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue, reduced volumes and decreased other revenue. Expenses also were lower year-over-year driven by fuel expense and last year's onetime charge for labor agreement. But there's an ongoing mismatch in our cost structure, resulting in an operating ratio of 63.4% as we continue to be challenged by inflation, including pressure from new labor agreements and higher casualty costs. Additionally, the lag on our fuel surcharge program negatively impacted results as fuel prices rose during the quarter. No doubt about it. It was a tough quarter, but I'm pleased with the positive productivity we're quickly gaining. Our service performance also is strengthening as we're positioning ourselves to meet customer demand while at the same time, storing assets. I'll let Eric and Kenny discuss both in more detail. Ultimately, we're taking the right actions to build from here. So with that, let me hand it to Jennifer to provide more details on the third quarter financials. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm going to discuss our third quarter results by walking through the income statement on slide five. Starting with operating revenue of $5.9 billion, down 10% versus last year on a 3% year-over-year volume decline. Breaking it down further, as illustrated in the appendix slides, freight revenue totaled $5.5 billion, down 9% versus 2022. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $637 million declined $515 million from last year. The impact of lower year-over-year fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenue 8%. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue, 150 basis points as solid core pricing gains were partially offset by an unfavorable business mix. Increased short-haul rock moves and fewer lumber carloads outweighed the impact of moving fewer low average revenue per car intermodal shipments. In addition, our pricing gains continue to include the impact of certain coal and intermodal contracts that are more reflective of current market conditions. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13% versus last year, driven by a $70 million year-over-year reduction in accessorials. Switching to expenses, where again, more detailed information can be found in the appendix. Operating expense of $3.8 billion declined 4%, driven by lower fuel prices, last year's onetime charge for labor agreements and volume-related costs. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased $77 million versus 2022, which does include last year's $114 million onetime labor charge. Third quarter workforce levels increased 3% and our active TE&Y workforce is up 2% as we graduated new train crew personnel during the quarter. At this point, with our train crews more appropriately staffed, our training pipeline is shrinking. Today, we have just over 500 employees in training, down more than 50% from last quarter's pipeline of roughly 1,200. Excluding the impact of last year's labor charge, cost per employee was essentially flat in the third quarter as we are starting to generate better overall productivity. As a result, we now expect full year cost per employee to be up closer to 3%. Both third quarter and full year cost per employee reflect elevated workforce levels and better crew efficiency, partially offset by wage inflation, which includes $20 million in the third quarter from paid sick leave. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 25% on a 21% decrease in fuel prices from $3.96 a gallon to $3.12. Our fuel consumption rate was flat, but showed positive momentum through the quarter as we stored locomotives and improved freight car velocity. Finally, other expense grew 18%, primarily related to continued pressure in casualty costs. It also reflects the impact of onetime write-offs as highlighted in the financial walk down slide on 22 in the appendix. The resulting outcome is third quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, down 17% versus last year. Below the line, other income decreased $18 million driven by last year's $35 million gain from a real estate transaction. Interest expense increased 6%, reflecting higher average debt levels. Income taxes are lower in the quarter on reduced income and lower tax rates that resulted in a $41 million deferred tax expense reduction. Similar to last year's $40 million tax reduction, we again had three states cut corporate income tax rates in the third quarter. Net income of $1.5 billion declined 19% versus 2022, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in an 18% decrease in earnings per share to $2.51. Third quarter operating ratio increased 3.5 points to 63.4%. Core results, which include the impact of inflation, lower volumes and cost inefficiencies accounted for the majority of the year-over-year change. Turning now to slide six and cash flows. Year-to-date, cash from operations totaled $6 billion, a decrease of roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also were impacted. Year-to-date, we've returned a little more than half of the cash generated or $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio up slightly from 2022 levels at three times as we continue to be A rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up now on slide seven. The overall financial story and outlook for the remainder of 2023 is largely unchanged. We're facing a demand environment where we don't expect full year volumes to exceed industrial production. We do, however, still expect to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Although as we've discussed through the year, not to the level that offsets the negative impact of elevated costs on our operating ratio. Fuel also remains a headwind on earnings per share, although moderating from the $0.34 negative EPS impact in the third quarter to approximately $0.10 of negative year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter. And that assumes fuel prices in the fourth quarter are around $3.30 a gallon. And significant inflation headwinds remain primarily in the form of the new labor agreements. We expect similar levels for fourth quarter paid sick leave expense to third quarter and the impact of the BLET work rest agreements will primarily be seen through elevated force levels. Finally, our capital plan is coming in a little bit higher at $3.7 billion. All that said, the important takeaway from today's results and our view of tomorrow is that we're making gains from maximizing growth opportunities and repricing our business to improving service and generating productivity, we're striving to build on the current momentum as we end 2023 and enter 2024 on a path to further financial improvement. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to give us a view of the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue declined 9% with a 3% decrease in volume for the third quarter. Let's jump right into the business team to recap the market drivers on the revenue side. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 10% compared to last year, driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 4% decline in volume. Grain exports were softer than last year due to tight supply. Coal volume was down 5% for the quarter by continued decline for the use of coal and electricity generation combined with competitive pressures from lower natural gas prices. Lastly, we saw a reduction in import beer carloads due to the increased utilization of larger railcars, which creates value for both the customer and Union Pacific. Industrial revenue was down for the quarter driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volumes. Softer decline for lumber and corrugated boxes continue to be a challenge, but our relentless focus on business development is driving excellent growth in our Rock network that supports construction of new emerging LNG facilities along the Texas Gulf and growth in the petroleum products for both domestic and Mexico energy reform. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 4% decrease in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car from fuel surcharges in a challenging truck market. Automotive volumes were positive with continued strength in OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts. In addition, a robust business development pipeline like winning both wagon shipments from the Texas Gulf enabled us to outperform the market in the quarter. Intermodal volumes were down in the quarter, primarily driven by softness in parcel segment and weak imports on the West Coast. However, domestic truckload volume was slightly up driven by business development wins and strengthen our Mexico shipments. Turning to slide 10. Here is our outlook for the fourth quarter as we see it today. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile. We are watching grain closely as we enter the export season. Crops have been harvested right now and increased supplies will be available to move. US soybean export sales have started out floor than forecasted. However, we have an improved service product this year to capture more available demand. Lastly, our forecast for renewable biofuel feedstock continues to remain strong. We see solid demand in this market and continue to capture new business. We recently landed opportunities with projects coming online soon in Iowa, Louisiana and Nevada. Moving onto Industrial. The economic forecast for industrial production looks to stay depressed in the fourth quarter. However, we expect petroleum and construction markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development. And finally, for premium, we are staying close with our intermodal customers in this challenging demand environment. We've seen a seasonal uptick at the beginning of the quarter and we believe our improved service product positions us well to handle market demand. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and elevated shippable ground count. However, we are watching closely the ongoing UAW negotiations and the negative impact they are having on fourth quarter volumes as the strikes persist. In summary, we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio that allows us to see positive momentum in some of our commodities. The team remains focused on what we can control. and I'm proud of the progress we've made in such a challenging market. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities that we're actively pursuing by leveraging our great franchise and extending our reach with transload, interline and short line partners. We are winning new business and I am confident that with our improved service product, we can open up more doors to new profitable growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on slide 12. As Jim mentioned, safety is the foundation of everything we do, and our goal is to lead the industry. Union Pacific can be the best because we've been there before. We have exceptional people and the entire team is focused on returning every employee home safely every day. While our progress has been encouraging, we must continue to improve technology and strive to provide best practices to the industry and the communities that we serve. Safety impacts every facet of our business, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders and we are committed to world-class safety performance. Closely aligned with our goal of industry-leading safety, we are confident in our ability to lead the industry in both service and operational excellence. In late August, the southwestern portion of our network was challenged by a series of intense weather events that caused widespread flash flooding and washouts. However, through the bold and relentless efforts of our team, we were able to quickly respond and rapidly restore operations. Despite the weather headwinds, our performance metrics improved year-over-year. We look to maintain that positive momentum as the vast majority of our metrics in the month of September represented our best performance year-to-date. Freight car velocity improved 5% this quarter versus last year. Throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity of around 210 miles per day. The impact of increased freight car velocity can be felt by our customers through the benefit of improved trip plan compliance, both intermodal and manifest and auto TPC saw a sizable 13 and 6 point year-over-year improvement, respectively. We will continue our work to deliver the service we sold to our customers. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on slide 13. The team is continuing to take actions to right-size resources to align with current volumes and run an even more efficient network. This incorporates Jim's strategy of empowering our people closest to the work and removing layers to increase the speed of decision-making. Locomotive productivity improved 4% versus last year, as we continue to identify opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. The third quarter marked both our lowest active high horsepower fleet size and the highest quarterly locomotive productivity number since the first quarter of 2022. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, was down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of volume declines, coupled with increased workforce levels. Leveraging a larger workforce, we have reduced borrow outs to the lowest total of the year and slowed hiring. We remain firmly focused on effectively managing our workforce levels and recognize the importance of balancing our resources as we plan for the future. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2022, despite lower volumes in our intermodal business. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by over 500 feet or 6% since January of this year. Our focus on train length is paying dividends, and we are continuing our work to further improve this measure. While our service product demonstrated noticeable improvement, there are more opportunities to improve the efficiency of our locomotive fleet, increased workforce productivity and maximize train length. We must sustain momentum across all of our operating metrics as we exit the year. So with that I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Vena : Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what we've -- you've heard from our team. Jennifer walked you through the inflationary pressure we continue to face broadly throughout our cost structure, but more specifically from new labor agreements. These are real hurdles that will require price generation and productivity to overcome. Kenny outlined a challenging volume environment, one with price spots like construction and biofuels, but ultimately is being overwhelmed by soft consumer markets. Despite this environment, the team is leveraging our business development pipeline to bring new business to the railroad. And finally, from Eric, you heard that we're improving safety, service and efficiency. We exited the quarter with great momentum. September was a very strong month across all of our operating metrics and the momentum continues today, but we're still nowhere near what I believe we can deliver. There's still plenty of room to improve. I came back to win and I could see the opportunity at Union Pacific. In a short period, we've increased the urgency across all facets of our strategy. The ultimate outcome is better service for our customers, which drives growth for the railroad by aligning the team with a strategy of safety, service and operational excellence, we will win. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob? Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning, and congrats on the new role, Jim. Jim, maybe just starting there on operations and Eric, is this -- what is changing here or what needs to change? Is it the plan? Is it -- you have too much equipment -- maybe talk a little bit about what metrics you focus on as you get started or productivity. You threw out there, there were too many locomotives, maybe provide some numbers and targets and thoughts on how you get there? Thanks. Jim Vena : And nice to be back and nice to hear your voice again, and I'll let Eric jump in, in a minute, but because he's the operating person. He's responsible. He is the person I'm going to keep accountable for to make sure we drive it. But what metrics do I look at? I haven't changed. A successful railroad is always fluid, make sure that you operate in a manner where you don't impact the network because of decisions you made with the kind of service that you've sold and the way you use your assets and people and whether you have the capacity on the railroad. So when I look at Union Pacific, what do I look at, at a high level, I look at do we have the physical plant to be able to handle the traffic and be able to handle the ups and downs that every railroad or knows happens with weather who thought we were ever going to get a hurricane in the West Coast, okay? That's always an Eastern seaboard issue more and a Gulf issue, but not Western, but I think we did as a team, we did a great job of recovering. So you need a strong network, and we have the capacity there. We'll continue to invest to make sure. So that's important to me. And we have to make sure that we have a buffer of people and assets so that we're ready for the ups and downs the business that happens because I wish it was flat line Ken and you know it as well as I do. You've been following the railroads for a long time. So let me go on because this is an important question is what do I look at? I look at -- in the morning, first thing when I get up, I'd probably get about 100 different touch points on the railroad, all in one spreadsheet. But what I actually look at is I look at revenue first. Where are we financially? What was our volume like? And what kind of -- where the revenue is? And if it's not good, the next call is to Kenny. Okay? Then the next thing I look at is car velocity. It's an end-to-end measure tells me how well the railroad is doing. 210 is a good number, but nowhere near what's possible. So Eric's got has done a great job so far, but we need to push more. Then it's -- then you continue to look at the fluidity numbers. How well we are at crew changes, how the intermodal terminals, how fast we're getting to pad, how fast we're allowing the truckers to go through. So there's a lot of metrics that we look at that most people probably haven't heard me talk about, but I thought I'd give you a little broader view of what I look at. And then after you do that, there's the asset issue. How many cars per carload, the locomotives. So we've got over 500 locomotives parked. And those 500 are ready to go locomotives. So we could turn them on in a short period of time. We've got some place in strategic locations if we need them on the network to keep the service level that we sold. On top of that, we have more locomotives that are stored for longer term. So we're in good shape on assets. We spool up this railroad to operate at the level that is possible with the type of business that we have. And I think it's a win-win for us Ken and that's what I look at every morning. Eric, do you want to add anything? Eric Gehringer : When we think about recap in the quarter, Ken, you start thinking about we did make great progress in the quarter from a fluidity perspective to Jim's point. And when you think about what did we do with that, we were able to store approximately 300 locomotives during the quarter. We're able to reduce our recrew rate. We took down our borrow out to the lowest level we've had all year. Now we continue to face the headwind from a workforce productivity of some of our agreements. So clearly, the challenge that we've given ourselves and we continue to challenge ourselves with is how do you work to overcome that productivity headwind. So when you think about things like some of the agreements that we've signed that actually allow us to remove certain people off of certain jobs across the system. We work to continue to reduce the fleet even more as we grow train length. I'm super proud of the team for the train length they've grown since January. There's still more opportunity there. When I think about remote control locomotives have been able to reduce some of our gain productivity and some of that, that's an opportunity for us. And the list goes on and now, we probably could talk about it for an hour. So I'm very excited about it. I think this is just the beginning. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Fadi Chamoun : Yeah, good morning, and welcome back, Jim. I mean a quick question. I think we've heard this in the past many times and maybe from you Jim, it's first, you have to fix kind of the engine and ultimately energize the commercial momentum. And I think the success story around the industry really are in that vein where a collaboration between operation and commercial have been a big catalyst for that. So my question is in terms of fixing the engine and you talked about car velocity, where do you think kind of you are for the network that you have in that process? And what is ultimately the right kind of goal from a car velocity perspective from an asset velocity perspective for UP, where are you in that process? And as we go into 2024, can you kind of make progress can you improve operating ratio even if volume or flat or the economy is muted and there is no momentum on that front? Jim Vena : So Fadi, I like the question because it frames exactly what -- when I came back to work the challenges that I could see the first challenge we had was inflation, both input costs plus labor costs and some of the collective agreements we signed. Every CEO that comes in always wants to blame people beforehand. That's not the way I look at it. That's the challenge. I knew what I would get myself into. So we do -- how do we fix that piece is as we drive and look for efficiency, and there's efficiency there. Usually, I don't give a -- and you know that, Fadi, I don't forecast numbers. But I'll tell you, I'll be disappointed if that car velocity doesn't return to where it was before that we had in 2020. There's no reason for us to not be low 220s. So that's about as far as I'm going to get on that number. If I look at the other piece that we have to do and Kenny is all over it and his team is, we know that we can't through efficiency and productivity recover everything in the long-term. But what we can do is we can price properly for what the service that we're providing to our customers, and Kenny's all over that. And that's going to take a little bit of time, and I'll let Kenny later on talk about this. But -- so the way I look at it is those two things, if we do them right, and let's leverage this railroad that we have, okay? We're a 70-mile an hour railroad. There's only one other railroad in North America that runs their freight trains at 70 miles an hour, okay? So let's leverage that. And you could see that when we changed the service out of Mexico because we want to leverage Mexico to grow our business in and out. And by doing that and providing customers a service that from the border, nobody can beat us to Chicago. We have the fastest service of anybody, especially with the new train service that we have on. So we should leverage that. Now not everybody wants speed, so we have to make sure that we're consistent. We also have to leverage our network. I love the places we serve and where we can take our customers to. I love the way our origination customers are and the number we have in the variety crossing all market segments. And if we do that, Fadi, we become the most efficient railroad. Operationally, we -- I've always said this, and I will continue to say it. We will have the best margin railroad in North America, best operating ratio, best margin, whichever way you want to look at it, I'm comfortable with that. And we give a chance for the customers that are with us to win and we look to move customers that are using other modes, including trucks that look at the railroad as their way that they want to win. So I'm happy. I didn't come back to work to lose. I came back to win. I was more than comfortable. Most people in my age are thinking about doing other things. In fact, I had a trip to K2 plant. And when the opportunity came up and we agreed with the Board on what the strategy was and what we wanted to do moving forward, I said, listen, I'm all in. Let's go. So I've been working hard with the team and I'm pushing them hard. At the end of the day, we need to make decisions quicker. We need to react quicker. We need to quit having so many layers that slow down the decision-making, and with that, we end up winning, Fadi. Hopefully, I answered your question. I know it was a long answer. And maybe there won't be any other questions after this. Fadi Chamoun : Appreciate it. Thanks. Jim Vena : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, Jim, welcome back, Jennifer, Kenny and Eric. Wanted to focus a little bit on sort of the inflation and pricing dynamic that we have going on here currently. Is this just a case for waiting until we can get to repricing some more of the contracts as we move through and seeing sort of better fluidity in the railroad? And are we just sort of in for a few tough quarters here in terms of comps? Jim Vena : Kenny, go ahead. Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thanks for that question. No, we're not waiting. We're repricing these contracts right now in real time. We're having some very clear and direct conversations with customers. The commercial team is doing an excellent job of really articulating what took place from a labor standpoint and these costs and specifically how what we're doing and what Eric is doing on his side, how we'll benefit our customers. Now I'll tell you that our customers are seeing some of the same pressures and it's playing out in their markets that way too. The other thing, and Jennifer talked about this a little bit we're investing a lot of money here. We're investing $3.7 billion. We don't lose an opportunity to share that with customers and talk about the value that they get from those investments. And so you look at that, you look at the improved service product that Eric is delivering us. We have no problem looking at our customers in eye talking to them about pricing the value that's there. Jennifer Hamann : And Kenny just to remind Jason and others. So we can't access all of our contracts immediately from a price standpoint. So we do have, call it, half of our book of business is in multiyear contracts. So to your question, Jason, it does take us a bit to work through and reprice those contracts. But Kenny and team are very focused at every opportunity they get, they're having that conversation and they're winning in the marketplace with higher prices. Jason Seidl : And Jennifer could you remind us how they renew through the course of '24 what percent? Jennifer Hamann : So we've not talked about 2024, but in general, call it, half of our book is multiyear contracts, 25% is tariff and the other 25% or so are contracts that are a year or less in duration. Jason Seidl : Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate the time. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks very much. Hi, Jim. Hi, Jennifer. Hi, everyone. Jennifer, can you talk about, I guess, OR expectations as we move from 3Q to 4Q, obviously, the fuel headwind I think that gets even better sequentially. You talked about year-over-year, but I think it actually gets a little bit better sequentially. You're moving 8,000 more carloads per week. It's only two weeks into the quarter, so I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we're seeing some decent sequential volume growth. So could you talk about that? And then, Jim, just related to Jim and Eric, actually, you talked about getting car velocity up to 220 miles per day. You've already had great improvement on that in recent months and that has corresponded nicely to kind of this improvement in volume. Should we think that, that increase to 220 allows you to essentially move more volume that's waiting to be moved and we can see kind of a corresponding increase in kind of the seven-day carloadings? And how do you get comfortable? How do you get us comfortable that the added volume doesn't drive service challenges, which historically has been the case for all railroads. So if you can just talk about that as well. Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : I'll maybe start off and address your question, at least the question about sequential OR improvement. As I've said in my prepared remarks, we're looking to build off the momentum that we have here as we ended out the third quarter and take that into the fourth quarter. And so without making any guide relative to what fourth quarter volumes are going to do, to your point, we're off to a good start, very pleased by that. But we're going to operate as efficiently as we can. And we do think we have an opportunity to have sequential gains going from third quarter to fourth quarter on the OR basis. It's going to take hard work by the team. It's going to take continued gains in terms of how we're operating the railroad and driving efficiency, but that's absolutely the goal that we're looking at. Jim, do you want to maybe hit the rest of this question about freight car velocity. Jim Vena : So what -- the reason I use car velocity is it truly is that end-to-end number that gives you a great indication. And it's not the only indicator, but it gives you an indicator. So I like the question. You said, can you handle an increase in business and are you leaving business behind? I wish we were leaving business behind. I really do and we are not. And we will look for everything we can to get more business. The railroad and railroads get themselves in trouble when they lose sight of what the fundamentals are for an increase in business. Increasing business can come in a lot of different ways. One is it can be bulk, which adds people adds locomotives as puts more pressure on the capacity. And we built this railroad that has the capacity, which you always have to concentrate on and usually is the limiting factor when you increase especially on the carload business is how well your terminals and what the capacity is on the terminals. And when I was here last time, we worked on in the Houston area and invested a lot of money to make sure that, that terminal has the capacity to grow with the products that we handle in the industrial landscape. And it's important for us and we are going through a process to make sure that every car has the least amount of touch points, fluidity is king. And that we can handle the most cars per employee within all those terminals and we have the gap that allows us to be able to react when the business comes up. If you add an extra intermodal train or you add an extra 1,000 feet on one of our locomotive trains. That's an easier fix again, as long as the terminals, whether it's G4 in Chicago or it's the Dallas terminals have the capability to handle it in an expeditious manner the same way. I think we have it with all the business that Kenny's promised me, okay? Is as we have the capacity, but we will invest and make sure we try to stay ahead of the curve on the fluidity on our terminals. And if we drive the terminals properly because that's usually your limiting factor more so than what the physical plant is out in the railroad and we keep that buffer of people so that we have the people to react. I'm not real worried about if we go up another 10,000 carloads. In fact, what a challenge to have. So Kenny, your job to bring it on. So thank you very much for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Hi. Thanks. I think Intermodal is often viewed as critical or key long-term growth engine for the industry. Are you now in a position do you think to start taking more share from trucks with trip plan compliance moving higher? And if not, what still needs to happen to get intermodal to grow, obviously, other than the macro, is it more service from you? Do truck rates have to move up? Can you give some thoughts around that? Thank you. Jim Vena : Kenny, if I can just start real quick, and then I'll pass it over to you. The price is important. You have to have the right price that allows you, but service has to be consistent. And a few weeks is not good enough for any customer to say, how's the railroad do it? If I was a customer, I'd be looking at -- are you consistent in your service? And when you get impacted because our car velocity will drop with some weather events through the winter. This is not a game where you can forecasted to be at a 220 level all the time. We're going to have some impact. Sometimes it will be higher, sometimes lower. It's how fast we recover. If we can do that and we can show shippers that we have the capability to deliver their products in a consistent manner, recover fast, then I think we have the opportunity. But it takes time. No one's going to believe you the first time you show up and say, wow, we did had a great September. Well, how about January? How was that? And how was 2022? I think they have memories of that. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Just to build on what Jim mentioned, let me just level fit. First, we've got a really strong stable of customers private assets, customers that are on our network along with our own railroad assets with EMP UMAX and so -- what that does is that provides optionality for the BCO. So that's the first thing that we are appreciative of. Next as you look at all the product development that we're investing, investing in a little bit more expansion in Kansas City, the new product development with Twin Cities, Inland Empire. You look at the discussion around Eric really improved product around coming into and out of Mexico. That's been great for us. But setting aside this macro thing as our service improves, really, the North Stars going over the road. You've heard us say by our estimation that we've got a pretty low market share in terms of overall rail coming into and out of Mexico, and that's ripe for more penetration and we're inserting more products out there. We announced that we've got a product to the Southeast that we're taking advantage of. And so very bullish, we're on offense and we're clear-eyed about growing there. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question, Jordan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Thanks. Good morning. Welcome back Jim. Just wanted to ask more about visibility to the cost inflation on labor side specifically into '24. Obviously, it's been a challenge, but it's going to get will be a little bit more challenging next year, I think of the 4.5% increased bonus and maybe some work rest rules around SMART-TD. So maybe Jennifer you can give us some sense as to how much visibility you have for the cost inflation side when it comes to labor. And then Jim, would just love to get your thoughts on perhaps just the broader regulatory picture. Obviously, UP had some challenges with the regulator on embargoes. Last year, there was a FRA letter about some of the infections. So UP has been under the microscope a little bit. Just wanted to see how you perceive that as you're new into the seat? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : We're talking about inflation. I mean we're still in the process of putting together our 2024 plan, but you hit some of the key ones there, Brian, in terms of July 1 is the last of the scheduled wage increases for the craft professionals from the PEB and that's 4.5%. Obviously, there will be wage increases on the non-agreement side as well. So there will be labor inflation pressures. You mentioned the work rest. And so those are all -- while there are pressures, there are opportunities, right, for us to look at how we can be more productive in how we do every part of our business. And so that's one of the things we always challenge the team with is how can we chip away at inflation. It's not just Kenny's job from a price standpoint. It's all of our jobs as we look to drive productivity and work more efficiently. Purchased services and materials, that's an area that also has seen some pretty heavy inflation over the last couple of years. The labor piece of that probably will continue. As the labor market stays tight, probably we'll continue to see more pressure as well. Beyond that, if I think about fuel, obviously, driven by energy markets, we have opportunities there to be more efficient on the equipment rent side. That's where car velocity certainly can play a role for us as we speed up the network, turn the assets more efficiently. And then the last one I'll mention is the other expense line, which, as you know, has been pressured the last year or so on the casualty side, and that's some higher verdicts, higher awards. And that's probably something that's going to be around for a bit. That's why that's the corollary benefit to us running a safer railroad is taking those incidents off the table. We want everybody to go home safe. We want our customers' freight to arrive undamaged but then it flows through from a cost standpoint as well. So those are kind of the big buckets that I'll outline for you. And obviously we'll talk in more specifics when we put the plan together and talk to you in January. Jim Vena : You bet. So Brian, listen, good article on the cars per employee. I think it was a great comparison and it shows where the opportunity is. So well done on that. I enjoyed reading that last night, one of the last things I did before I went to bed. You asked about the regulatory agencies and how the relationship is. I think it's best to describe it like this. With the FRA, we're aligned. We have the exact same goal. And I like that the FRA wants to come out and look at the railroad to see if our safety management system is proper. We're getting -- we're using the railroad in the proper manner and that we're safe. So I love that. I have no issue with it. And I have a good relationship. I've reached out good relationship with the FRA, but it's not my relationship that's the most important is how we deal with things out in the field. We're professional. We look for ways to improve, and we work with the FRA because they get to look at other railroads. And when they give us some feedback, we need to take it to see how we improve. So I think that's the way the relationship. And on the STB, there's lots going on, and I won't discuss the specifics, but I grew up in Canada working on a railroad that had inter-switching for a distance, and I know what the pluses and minuses are there. I don't see anything as we're moving forward, and we'll give our feedback because I think we want to make sure that we don't impact our customers and what we serve and slow down the railroads because of a regulatory framework. So we have to be careful because our customers compete with people with other, of course, within the US, other modes, but they also compete in the world. There's products that we move for customers that go around the world that if we wreck the efficiency of the railroads, it's a mistake. And I know the STB does not want that. What they want is they want to make sure that we have good service. And that's the best way for us to make sure that the regulatory environment doesn't affect us is we provide good service if we provide the service that we sold to our customers, then we win. So I'm very comfortable with the relationship. I think we need to continue to communicate, and we both. We have the same end goal with the STB and the FRA. So Brian, I think it's -- the relationship is good. We'll take the feedback, and we'll see where we can improve. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you, Jim. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning and welcome back, Jim. So it sounds like we want to get more price more productivity, but we still have inflation. You said you want to get to best-in-class margin. I guess we got to get improvement first. So when do you think you can start improving margins again? And then separately, Jennifer, the buyback has just been a big part of the earnings growth for a long time. Is this a temporary pause, more of a prolonged change, now you're thinking about the buyback? Any thoughts there? Thank you. Jim Vena : Jennifer, why don't you answer the first piece of Scott's question. Jennifer Hamann : Sure. No. This is not a change in our philosophy around capital allocation, Scott, as we talked back in July. This is just looking at cash flows, looking at the balance sheet and taking a temporary pause. You heard me mention that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are around three times here at the end of the quarter, a little bit elevated from where they have been historically. And so our job is to hit on the things you mentioned earlier with the price, productivity, grow the business and generate more EBITDA, generate more cash flow and resume our share repurchase program. Jim Vena : And Scott, on the second piece is, the last time I showed up in January 14th of 2019 versus August 14th of this year is the railroad is more efficient. It did not back up to the place where it was before. It was very easy pickings to go park a 1000 locomotives. So we don't have that. But what we do have is we still have productivity. I see productivity across everything that we do from how management works, how many people we need to operate the railroad to how well we use our assets. So it won't be quite as large. It won't be the $1.3 billion that we did last time, but there is productivity gain that we can do. So with that, it's going to take a little bit longer. Some of these changes that I see will not be as quick. I won't be able to go to North Platte and Park 90 locomotives because we had them parked outside the diesel shop first day. But there is ways for us to speed it up and there's still locomotives that we can park and make sure that they're used efficiently. So it will take us a little bit longer. And stay tuned with us and you'll see hopefully incremental changes to our numbers that will tell you that we're headed the right way. And there'll be ups and downs. There is no advantage of budgeted some things we can't control. I really don't know what's going to happen to the economy next year. Are we going to have a recession? Are we not going to have a recession? I'm hoping we -- the country does not have a recession and that would help us. So hopefully, I answered your question, Scott. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, operator, and welcome back, Jim. I know when you first came back and you just mentioned locomotive storage employee productivity improvement, we're really a key focus for you very successful on that. They had some pretty quick turnarounds. Just wondering now, you're in the seat, you probably have multiyear views here and whether you can grab some longer-term kind of structural efficiency objectives. And I'm referring here to things like comp yards and things that take a little longer time to address that perhaps you didn't look at immediately when you first were in the role that that you may be looking at here now. I'm just wondering if when you look at the hump yards that Union Pacific has on its network, do you think they're right aligned? Or do you see some opportunity to reduce some of those or any other infrastructure assets that are on the network? Jim Vena : Walter, nice talking to you again and good question. So the real world, the way I look at it is there's nothing wrong with hump yards, but they have to fit into the fluidity and the touch points of how many times we touch cars and how many cars we actually have to handle. And hump yards are okay. So at this point, with the way the network is as far as getting into that detail is good. What I don't like that I've seen is our put through is not as fast. Our dwell needs to drop our dwell and the amount of time that we have railcars in yards at the intermodal terminals at intermediate points will drive productivity gains so that we are able to have more fluidity and that's real important to me. Now when I came back last time I came with one goal, I came back, I came to work drive operational efficiency. I didn't look at the rest of the company very much and the rest of the company needs to be looked at. And that's what we're doing now. So everything that we did operationally, we are going to look at what we've done. And 1 example is the delayering exercise, you can't have 9 levels from the CEO to the people who actually do the work and expect that the message is clear, the decisions are made clear, and there isn't some hiccup in the decision stops. And I want to drive it so that we have way less layers. And that means with less layers, the people out in the field are empowered to make the right decision, which trained the hump, which trained the switch? How we move the cars? What are we doing to customers? What are we doing for scheduling? How are we loading? Is our loading pattern, right? So many things that we can do. And if we do that, they're better at it than us, Walter. There's no way that Jim Vena, even though I think I'm a decent operator, I could go operate the hump yard, maybe when I retire next time we become just a hump yard operator in one place and see how well because I think a few people would love me to go out there and see if I'm as good as I say sometimes, okay? But at the end of the day, that's what's important. And that's one of the things. That's a big change this dealer and exercise that we're going through and stay tuned, we'll announce what the findings are as we move ahead. Walter Spracklin : Looking forward to hearing about it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning, and Jim, I also wanted to say welcome back. I think the -- this is a bit of a high-level question, and I'm guessing the answer is kind of both. But wanted to see if you could give some color on how we should look at the opportunity in terms of being a volume story or a cost story. I mean you clearly did a lot with cost last time in 2019, 2020. You are talking a lot about productivity. But what's the -- what's really the more important lever for operating income growth in the next couple of years? Is this a little bit of productivity and a lot of volume? And then I guess to the extent that there's the productivity side, is that driven by headcount reduction? Or is that really more other cost buckets like locomotive costs, car costs, that type of thing? Thank you. Jim Vena : Good question. Why don't we start with, Kenny, why don't you talk about the opportunity on the growth side, the pricing side and what we have -- what we're looking forward to? Kenny Rocker : So we talked a little bit about it in terms of markets like our biofuels very bullish on our construction and autos, I mean, just set aside the strike that's going on now. I talked about the business development win, but it's still holding up from a demand environment. We need the strike to come back. And then we've talked about international intermodal. Now we've had a little bit of what I'll call a seasonal bump, we'll call it peak season. And you've heard me say we haven't had one in a few years, so it's nice to see one. But on the domestic side, also there's just still a tremendous amount of over-the-road share that there. We think it's in the low teens that's in between out of Mexico and then the Mexico in terms of over-the-road share that we should be gathering. Eric is out there getting up more improved products. We've got a lot of optionality out of Mexico. We see that as a growth engine. As some of these consumer-facing products improve. We've always said that we felt good about our petrochem business. Industrial chem is also included in that. So if you look across the line, there's a lot of upside, and we're very bullish on the volume growth is there. Jim Vena : So Eric, why don't you talk about it? Because the question is great. It's -- there's no advantage of but that we have to grow the business. We have the price and take care of what's happened to us inflation-wise and leverage our network, but productivity, what do you see your piece of it? Eric Gehringer : Absolutely. We talked about productivity really differentiated into two buckets to some of our commentary already this morning, there's no easy productivity, but this most straightforward productivity is when you get that volume, how do you leverage it on the existing network that we have, the existing trains we have the whole idea of being volume variable plus. The other bucket of productivity is how we actually do the work. So when we think about our locomotive shops, our mechanical shops or our engineering games, for example, on the non-op side, it's a real challenge to them to say, hey, you still need to do the important work, how you do it more efficiently. So when we think about going into a locomotive facility and making sure that we balance the headcount to the exact number of locomotives they have to the forecasted number to being really thoughtful about how do we use that material in there to being thoughtful about how do we think about redoing cores. I mean there's infinite areas of opportunity within each one of our departments to be able to look deep into the business, deep into the work and really find those opportunities. To Jim's point, it's a little bit harder work than it was a few years ago, but it's still work that we know how to do and work that we'll be successful doing that. Jim Vena : And I know neither one of them wanted to touch it, they always leave those things for me that people is going to be one. We look for cost savings on what our input costs are. And of course, it's much more difficult on -- in the inflationary place that we find ourselves in this country, but we're going to look for every opportunity to use less so that we can save costs that way. And on headcount, absolutely, we're going to use attrition to rightsize the company as much as we can to what we know now, we've identified where we want to get to. So it will be through attrition mostly, and we'll move ahead from there. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. So I wanted to talk a little bit about -- I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the earnings leverage we should have from some of the intermodal agreements you guys are signing, obviously, the Falcon service, the partnership with NS. How should we be thinking about the profile from a margin perspective of that traffic coming on, particularly early here as truck rates remain low and it seems like intermodal companies are out there just counting the service to take some share? And then maybe a bigger picture, Jim, could you talk a little bit about how you see the competitive dynamic for UP changing post the CP/KC acquisition. We've heard a lot from Lance in the past on this, but I don't think we've had a chance to hear you talk about how that acquisition creates risks or opportunities for Union Pacific from your perspective? Thank you. Jim Vena : Okay, Jennifer. Jennifer Hamann : Thank, David, for that question. You've heard us talk about margins before in terms of the -- when we look at it, where you see some of the greatest margin pressure relative to our book of business is in that business that's truck competitive. And we certainly are in a truck competitive market today. But that's also our opportunity that you've heard us talk about in terms of tremendous growth, and we know that there's leverage in margins from volume growth that can help drive greater productivity. And as we are building a better service product, certainly, as we provide better service, there's a price for that service. And we look to price to that to be able to meet that customer demand. I don't know, Kenny, if you want to add anything to that? Kenny Rocker : No. The only thing I'd say is that as we're looking in the current environment, we're certainly keeping our customers competitive with mechanisms that we have in our contracts, and we are clear out about as the markets change, they're stable now as they get a little bit more tighter, demand strengthen, we'll see upside from a price perspective, which should show up in margin. Jim Vena : And on the competitive dynamic and the specific example of CP/KC. So I think they're a great railroad. I think they have a great network. I think they're a leader, Keith, he's a friend. I've known him for a long time, and he's smart, knows out a railroad. So he knows how to balance safety service, asset utilization, cost control and developing is people, same thing as we do. So the competition is, and I like it. There's nothing wrong with little competition. So I want to win, he wants to win. There's no advantage of us that the CPKC, if it's origination, the destination on their railroad we have a competitive disadvantage. But the advantage we have is we've got this great network. We go through 23 states. We serve the population in the US, we have fast access. We have a 70-mile hour railroad. We're fast. And if we have to be, if that's what we sold was fast, we can do that. And you can see it when we move our parcel business as we're doing and getting up to their peak period coming up towards Christmas. So all those things plus we have access into Mexico, broader access than one or two places. We go into the -- into Mexico, from the West Coast all the way east in a number of locations. And we have a strong partner in FXC. And as you know, we own 26% of them and that helps us. So I'm excited. CP/KC is going to make it difficult and we're going to make it difficult. Now I don't chase price. This is not a price discussion. It's about a service and access to markets and how we do it. And I'll walk away from business if somebody wants to lower their price. Go ahead, take the business, I'll bring in a business that fits our network that makes sense. So that's how I think of competitors, and I could have that discussion about all the other railroads. I want us all to be really good and strong. David Vernon : So are you seeing a potential volume risk from a diversion standpoint? Jim Vena : Kenny? Kenny Rocker : No, we're going out there. We feel good about the service product. We're going head on. We're ready to compete. Again, the North Star, and I said this earlier, it's over-the-road. So we're on office and we're starting off well. David Vernon : All right. Thank you, guys. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. Hi, Kenny, can you expand a little bit on that over-the-road opportunity? Is it something that you're seeing build a lot more in the pipeline today? I know you had talked about some of your customers wanting to see maybe more reliable service before that sort of conversion happens in terms of those opportunities? But any color on how we should think about progression in terms of today versus the multiyear out? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So again I mentioned roughly mid-teens call it 15% that our estimation that's moving rail out of there. We see that as the right opportunity to go after that over-the-road products. We've got to revise more competitive, faster service product that Eric is delivering on in the high 90 percentile for what we've scheduled that too. And we have seen some wins. We have seen some over-the-road wins come early. We've added extra products that I talked about going into the Southeast. Remember, we're moving, Allison, our products seven days a week. That's in a few days a week and customers like that. And we see it as the right spot to go after and grow. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Christian Wetherbee : Thanks. Good morning. So we noticed that headcount was down sequentially for the first time in a while, and Jim, you noted using attrition here. So maybe thinking about the next couple of quarters, should we expect head count to stay relatively flat, maybe come down a little bit as you use attrition? And then maybe asked a different way, how much volume do you think you can manage with current headcount? So as we hopefully see a recovery in freight as we move forward, is there an opportunity to leverage this existing workforce to drive more productivity without adding heads? Jim Vena : Chris, nice to hear your voice again. There's so many pluses and minuses, additions or subtractions. We still haven't fully implemented the 11 and 4 deal on scheduling with BLET. And we haven't concluded negotiations with SMART-TD on what that does. So we have to see how that goes. The general way I see it, though, is that we do want to see a more productive workforce in the company as we move ahead. But I would be remiss to tell you without those collective agreements in place of exactly what the time line is. But you know me by now that I always look at what do we need of the railroad and is at the right level to be productive with it. So I'll do everything I can. But with those outstanding items, we still -- there's -- I just can't give you a black-and-white answer of what the time line is and how fast those changes go to where I want to take it. It might take a little bit longer than when -- if we didn't have those deals in place. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. But Jim, I do think it's safe to say, once we have those deals implemented and we're working to drive the productivity. Our long-term view is that we can grow volumes faster than we grow headcount. Jim Vena : Absolutely. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Jim Vena : Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, and congrats, Jim. So Jim, I guess, I think if we look back over the last number of CEOs at Union Pacific, the disappointment that I think probably all of them would share would be lack of relative volume growth and as I'm looking at my model here, I think RTMs this year are probably going to end up being down more than like 25% from where this company peaks way back in 2006. So as much as we're talking about service and the ability to grow and the pipeline looks strong, like we've heard that before. So what is different looking forward with you as CEO at Union Pacific that you think you can really capture some of that market opportunity? Jim Vena : Well, I'm going to repeat myself, but it truly is, you have to have the fundamentals, you have to provide the service. You have to see what's happening. And I think we can grow faster than what the economy gives us. And that's our goal and that's where we're going to drive it judge me in a year, okay? I want the Board to judge me. I want the shareholders to judge me and the team, and I think we're there. I think we can do that. Do we have some headwinds? Absolutely. You know the industry as well as I do. Coal is always an issue that we have to deal with. But the rest of the products that we have, we're going to go after it. We're going to go get it. We're going to bring it on in the right place. And if we grow not as fast as we want, we're going to price properly for the service we're providing. So I think it's a win-win, and let's talk next year. I'll put it on my calendar. You can ask me the question of how we're doing, okay. Brandon Oglenski : Will do, Jim. Thanks. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, we've talked about a lot of things as it relates to intermodal, new services, best wins, conceptually there should be some share shift back to the West Coast, hopefully, after a couple of years of losses there. But the truckload market on the over-the-road opportunity continues to bounce along this bottom. So how competitive is the pricing dynamic within intermodal, whether it's your new services relative to other rail options or relative to truck. And how do you manage then the capacity you're willing to commit to these new kind of growth alternatives when you do have maybe a competitive pricing landscape that's more difficult at this point of the cycle? Kenny Rocker : Yes. First of all, it's great that we put the investments in for our intermodal network. You've heard me mention them. I won't go over them again, but it does start there. Obviously, the service matters. We've been deliberate about making sure we can insert optionality on that domestic intermodal product, and we've done that. You've heard us talk about the strong stable we have as you look at Hub and Schneider and if -- and FTG that's there, our rail product with EMP, UMAX, and we've invested in that fleet from a GPS perspective, invested in the ramp. So we're prepared from that standpoint. You -- I think your question is a little bit about how we keep them competitive. And I've talked about that in terms of, again, we have mechanisms to make sure that our customers regardless IMCs, private assets are competitive. And what we want to be is just nimble and quick and change with the market so that we can get that margin and price improvement as we move along. Jonathan Chappell : Thanks, Ken. Jim Vena : Great. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Jim, you said you had about 500 locomotives parked. I was curious just high level, how do you think about the locomotive strategy at UP versus what you inherited? I know you've got a big order for refurbishment that will go out several years. But just strategically, longer term, how are refurbished locomotives performing? Where do you see your CapEx going over the next three, five, seven years to satisfy both the service needs you have and the emissions targets you put out there? Thank you. Jim Vena : Okay. So we'll continue to invest in our locomotives. And Bascome, we'll always make sure that we have the right locomotive and make them as fuel efficient as possible so that we can save fuel when we're operating. No advantage or buts that's what we'll continue to do. And as far as where the CapEx, we're not ready now, but I'm pretty sure that you'll see our CapEx be in at a different starting point next year than where we were this year. And that's how I view it and stay tuned. And when we get into January, we'll give you the numbers of what our plan is for next year. Thanks, Bascome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much, Jim, welcome back and congratulations. You've answered this a couple of different ways, but let me come at this in terms of what's different from 2019 since you came back. I think you talked a little bit about what's different at the railroad, but maybe talk about in terms of the customer expectations in the market or kind of where volume is, where business is and how the railroad in your view, needs to adapt? Jim Vena : Well, I think railroading, the basic foundation of railroad hasn't changed from 2019. How we look at the business at Union Pacific, how fast we are making decisions needs the change. When I showed up, I asked Kenny to give me a number of customers that I could talk to at a high level and talk about what our services, what our plan was. And one of them said to me that they wanted to invest a lot of money to be able to build out because there was expansions going on in the soda patch -- soda ash patch. So at the end of it, it was taking us over a year to give them a decision on whether we could do that. We need to change that. And if we change that and we were able to make the decision in four days, I got it. We can't make decisions in four days all the time, but we sure can make them in a few weeks instead of months. That's really important. That's a change in the way we want to do business. And the customers, the feedback was, there's opportunity for them to win in their marketplace, the customers that we have. So we need to build on that. And that's really important. The foundation is the same. We're going to operate a very efficient railroad, having a buffer, the fundamentals -- the five key fundamentals of how you operate the railroad, I'm not changing from. It's true, it's tested, it wins, it puts us in the right place. I'm not changing. And -- but we need to be consistent with our customers, work better for them to grow, and we win. So I'm looking forward to the challenge. One big difference between 2019 and now, my wife is still mad at me that I went back to work, okay? But other than that, everything else is good. Jeffrey Kauffman : Awesome. Well best of luck to you. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Hello, everybody. Just a follow-up on the Mexico and Falcon service commentary. Jim or Kenny, when you talk to customers kind of who are looking to potentially convert from truck or can convert from another railroad. How important is speed in their equation relative to an overall value proposition? I mean you said that you're at a bit of a structural disadvantage kind of given the interchange versus your peer, but what can you do from an overall value prop to kind of be competitive and kind of work against that structure? Does it [indiscernible] if you will. Jim Vena : Yes. Listen, I probably wasn't clear. I don't think structurally we have any issue with any competitor. I just wanted to give due to CP/KC, if you're an origination railroad just like us, if we originate in Salt Lake and we're going to Boise, Idaho, it's pretty hard for somebody to compete against us, another railroad. That's all I was saying. At the end of the day, I think we compete against anybody because of the network we have, the speed we have and what we're capable to open up for markets. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : So first of all, we know our customers. We know that automotive OEM with auto part for production is different than, say, an FAK business of -- contain our pillars. They are different. What differentiates us in that sense, I talked about the revised service product that is going to help us with customers that are speed sensitive. The fact that we have every day per week service, that's going to help us because that matters also. The fact that we have a group of private asset owners, and we also have our own containers to go into Mexico, that makes a difference. So again, we know our customers and those are the things that we talk to our customers about as we're winning business over the road. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning. Jennifer, you talked about comp per employee being up about 3% this year, but I wasn't sure if that included the impact of the abnormal labor costs from last year. So how do you expect comp per employee to trend sequentially into the fourth quarter? And as we move into 2024, do you think this is an area where the productivity opportunity has potential to fully offset the inflation headwinds we're seeing? Jennifer Hamann : So thanks for the question, Justin. In terms of your first question, when we talk about comp per employee, we do try to make it apples-to-apples. So we take out any of the one-timers. In terms of looking at it sequentially, as we go into the fourth quarter, there's probably a couple of things going on there to think about and consider. One is, as we're continuing to take people out of training classes, put them into full-time positions on the railroad. There's a little bit higher costs associated with that. And then just some of the OE capital mix that you get in the fourth quarter as you wind down some of the capital programs that can put a little pressure on there as well. Looking long-term, again, productivity and being able to offset cost inflation with productivity is always one of our objectives. Certainly, it's hard and a very high inflation environment, but that's our opportunity as well. That gives us the opportunity to really look critically at the work that's being done and make sure that we're being as efficient as we possibly can be. And I think you've heard on the call today, we see opportunities across the board, whether you're talking about how we're maintaining our locomotive fleet, how we're looking at our back-office functions, how we're managing the transportation employees. We have opportunities to be more efficient there. Jim Vena : Well, listen, thanks, everyone, and let me tie this up, and I really appreciate everybody taking the time this morning to join us and talk about Union Pacific. And I think the team that's with me here has done a great job of explaining what we do, but let me summarize it real quick. Our goals are clear. It's about safety, service and operating excellence. That's how we win. And we're going to be really good at operations. We're going to provide consistent service to what we sold, every customer has a different level of service they required. Some of them is fast, some of them is sustainable. Some of it is making sure you're consistent. We're going to leverage the railroad. We're going to do everything we can to leverage the physical plant that we have. We're going to be efficient on how we do it. We are going to deal with stakeholders at all levels in a professional manner and listen to their inputs and see what we can do. I think we can win. This is not going to be a short-term fix that -- you'll see it. But what you should notice is as we go through the next quarters, you will see us improve and when we get to the right place with the inputs that we have in this railroad. I'm excited. The team is excited. We're moving fast and again, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you all in the next quarter, if not some time before. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Mr. Vena, you may now begin. Jim Vena : Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's fourth quarter and full year results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. The Union Pacific team is executing our multiyear strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. Our fourth quarter shows a lot of what's possible and demonstrate that we're on the right path to achieving those goals. We exited 2023 with strong momentum, which gives me great confidence that we have a winning strategy. There's work to do, but we're building the foundation for future success. Now let's turn to Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.71 per share. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. Fourth quarter operating revenue was flat as increased volumes and core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix. Expenses year-over-year were also flat as lower fuel expenses and productivity gains were offset by inflation, volume-related costs and higher casualty expenses. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points versus last year. And more importantly, we demonstrated strong sequential OR improvement of 250 basis points from the third quarter. We are taking the right actions to increase the efficiency of our railroad while also improving service for our customers. Key to our strategy is excelling in what we control. We made great progress in those areas this quarter. That provides further proof that we're on the right path for future success. So with that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to provide more details on the fourth quarter and full year financials. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's begin by walking through our fourth quarter income statement on Slide 5. Starting with the top line. Operating revenue of $6.2 billion was flat versus 2022 on a 3% volume increase. Breaking it down further, freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 1%. The biggest driver of freight revenue in the quarter was fuel. Lower year-over-year fuel prices reduced fuel surcharge revenue and impacted freight revenue 375 basis points as fuel surcharges declined $180 million versus 2022 to $795 million. Volume growth in the quarter contributed positively, adding 350 basis points to freight revenue, and the combination of price and mix also was positive, increasing freight revenue, 75 basis points as solid core pricing gains were mostly offset by an unfavorable business mix. Intermodal shipments up 5% contributed heavily to the mix dynamic. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13%, driven by lower accessorial and subsidiary revenue. Switching to expenses, we provided expense details for both fourth quarter and full year in our appendix slides. But let me hit some of the highlights. Against our 3% volume growth, operating expense of $3.8 million was flat. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was flat compared to 2022. Fourth quarter workforce levels decreased 2%, while our active TE&Y workforce was flat against the 3% volume growth. This solid level of workforce productivity mostly offset wage inflation as cost per employee only increased 1% in the fourth quarter. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 11% on a 15% decrease in fuel prices from $3.70 per gallon to $3.16. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 3% as we moved a less fuel-efficient business mix with increased intermodal shipments and fewer coal moves. Finally, other expense grew 20% as a result of higher casualty costs and the comparison to 2022, which included insurance recoveries. Coming out of COVID, we had a sizable case backlog that we largely worked through the last couple of years. Importantly, we do not see these elevated expenses as a reflection of a long-term trend, particularly with our intense focus on improving safety. Fourth quarter operating income was flat at $2.4 billion. Below the line, other income increased $16 million due to higher real estate gains. Fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.71, both improved 1% versus 2022. Our operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points year-over-year and 250 basis points sequentially. Moving to Slide 6 with a quick recap of full year 2023 results. Revenue of $24.1 billion declined 3% driven by reduced fuel surcharges, business mix and lower volumes, partially offset by core pricing gains. Operating income totaled $9.1 billion and our full year operating ratio of 62.3% deteriorated 220 basis points. Earnings per share of $10.45 decreased 7% versus 2022 and then reflecting the impact of our overall financial results, return on invested capital declined 180 basis points to 15.5%. Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Full year 2023 cash from operations totaled $8.4 billion, down roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor agreement payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also reflected those impacts. We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the year at three times as we continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet and be A rated by our 3 credit agencies. While 2023 was a difficult year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last several months to improve our service and productivity. We believe this performance marks an inflection point as efforts to improve the efficiency of our railroad through safety, service and operational excellence is starting to be reflected in our financials. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to provide some comments on 2023 and kick off our commentary on 2024. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue was up 1% in the quarter as our volume gains of 3% were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. So let's jump right into the business teams to recap the market drivers on the revenue slide. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was flat compared to 2022, driven by a 3% increase in volume, offset by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges and the unfavorable impact of low natural gas prices on our index-based coal contracts. Fertilizer shipments grew compared to 2022 as demand for fuel application was strong due to lower nitrogen prices. Grain product shipments were up for the quarter as our team secured new feedstock opportunities for renewable diesel production in Louisiana and California. Additionally, ethanol shipments increased with our improved service. Lastly, coal continued to be challenged in the fourth quarter due to mild weather and decreased coal competitiveness from low natural gas prices. Industrial revenue was up 4% in the quarter, driven by a 3% increase in volume. Core pricing gains in the quarter were mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Business development in our petroleum and LPG commodity segments contributed to the growth. Demand improved for our plastics business in both export and domestic markets. However, sand volumes were negatively impacted by softer natural gas prices that reduced drilling in the Eagle Ford Basin and increased utilization of in-basin sand in the DJ Basin. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 4% increase in volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car from lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were negatively impacted by the UAW strike, but those decreases were mostly offset by dealer inventory replenishment and business development wins that I mentioned on the last quarter's call. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by stronger West Coast imports, domestic business development wins and strengthen our Mexico volumes. Now let's start talking about 2024. Here are some key economic indicators that we're watching this year on Slide 10. These are S&P's forecast from their January report, and you'll notice that it shows a mixed picture for 2024. Industrial production looks to be flat. Housing starts are expected to remain challenged, but demand for auto continues to be strong. Turning to Slide 11. Here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile and inventories are high. Domestic grain is relatively stable, but we are keeping a watchful eye on export demand. On a brighter note, we expect fertilizer to be strong as repair that Canpotex Portland facility are now complete and commodity prices remain competitive moving into the spring season. And growth within biofuels continues to be driven by strong demand outlook, combined with a heavy focus on capturing new business, including incremental volume secured from Minnesota and Iowa origins. Moving on to Industrial. The construction market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volumes as we're seeing softness in parts of the market. However, we foresee the petroleum and petrochem market remaining favorable due to our focus on business development. And finally, for premium on the international intermodal side, we expect the market to improve year-over-year, but a contract we lost earlier in 2023 will negatively impact our 2024 volumes. On the domestic side, we are staying close with our customers who have indicated that they'll see a soft start to the year. Nonetheless, our strong service product sets us up to handle market demand. And for automotive, we will see strength in this market with improved OEM production and business development wins. In summary, the economic environment continues to look muted in 2024, particularly in the first half. We're off a slower start in January based on severe winter storms and market challenges we're seeing in coal and intermodal. But I am encouraged that we expect to see growth in some markets with our strong focus on business development. For the second half, we are well prepared to handle the demand if the market and economy improves. We continue to make significant capital investments on both the carload and intermodal front to capture more freight over the road. Those investments, along with our unmatched service offerings and improved service products from Eric's team create a winning environment for our customers. I'm excited for the opportunities in front of us, and our commercial team is ready to help our customers win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 13. To start, I want to express my appreciation to the team for their relentless focus on improving our service product and driving network efficiency. It's thanks to their efforts that our network showed tremendous fluidity and reliability during the fourth quarter. Freight car velocity improved 14% to 217 miles per day compared to fourth quarter 2022. Increased train velocity and a reduction in terminal dwell drove that performance. Service was strong during the quarter as we saw a significant 12-point improvement in both intermodal and manifest and auto trip plan compliance. In addition to trip plan compliance, we have hundreds of customer-specific performance metrics that also showed great improvement throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we are delivering the service we sold to our customers, which is critical to our long-term growth strategy. While winter is here and has certainly brought its challenges, the railroad overall is very healthy, and I'm confident the team will continue its positive momentum. Safety continues to be the foundation of everything we do. During the quarter, we delivered improved derailment performance through our investments in technology and process. We remain focused on the critical actions that drive real change. So everyone goes home safely each day. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on Slide 14. During the fourth quarter, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 14% versus fourth quarter 2022 and 9% sequentially as we continue to identify and execute on opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. Throughout the second half of 2023, we stored nearly 500 units from our operable fleet. Workforce productivity improved 4% compared to fourth quarter 2022. With a strong crew base, we are focused on effectively managing workforce levels to the demands of the business. However, challenges do remain from scheduled work agreements that in the near term, require additional employees. Train length improved 2% compared to fourth quarter 2022 as we continue to remove car touch points from the system. In total, throughout 2023, we were successful in extending train length as improvements in the second half more than offset the declines in intermodal shipments. We remain persistent in our focus on train length to drive productivity while providing a better service product to our customers. As we move into 2024, we will continue to transform our railroad through a variety of technology initiatives and targeted capital investments designed to further improve safety, improve our service product, enhance resource utilization and ultimately lower our cost structure. So to wrap up, let's review our capital outlook for 2024 on Slide 15. We are targeting capital spending of $3.4 billion in 2024. Similar to 2023, we will support safe and productive operations by investing in our infrastructure and renewing our older assets. This includes modernizing locomotives and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. We are also investing in technology and terminal and mainline capacity projects to improve productivity. Specific to our technology investments, we recently cut over NetControl, replacing our 50-year-old transportation management system. This cutover positions us to use real-time analytics to open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. Great work led by our technology team. On the growth front, we will continue to invest in projects that expand our intermodal footprint and support business development in targeted high-growth areas such as Inland Empire, Kansas City and Phoenix to name a few. So with that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer to lay out our initial financial thoughts for 2024. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric. Turning to Slide 17. Let me start by pointing out that we added a new appendix slide that contains several of the 2024 modeling assumptions that should be helpful to everyone in framing our current expectations. As you heard from Kenny, it's a difficult market to forecast, as economic indicators show a muted and uncertain economy. Throwing a couple of other variables such as what the Fed might or might not do with interest rates and a presidential election, and we've got an interesting year ahead. On top of the macro pressures, lower coal demand and some lost international intermodal business are expected to negatively impact our volume. And as you've seen in the weekly carload data, January is off to a slow start as cold temperatures across our system impacted operations and volume with first quarter volume down 9% year-to-date. I am confident, however, that our strong and improving service product will allow us to capture available demand. We clearly demonstrated that in the fourth quarter as we took advantage of the unexpected but short-term surge in intermodal. More certain than the economy is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars even with ongoing headwinds from certain intermodal contracts. With those pressures, we do not expect price to be accretive to margins in this year. Key for UP in 2024 is our ability to control the controllables by driving a strong safety culture, making ongoing service gains and improving network efficiency. We're confident that regardless of the demand environment, we will take the necessary actions to run a more efficient network. Finally, with capital allocation, there is no change to our long-term strategy. We are investing $3.4 billion back into the railroad as Eric detailed. Next, we prioritize our industry-leading dividend payout and then excess cash will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases. However, given first quarter debt maturities of $1.3 billion, we will not be repurchasing shares in the first quarter. It's always difficult in late January to make predictions for the year ahead, and this year is no different. There are clearly ongoing challenges from a macro and inflationary perspective. What is very encouraging though, as we start out 2024 is our momentum, which you've heard us mention several times today. We demonstrated with our fourth quarter performance, what's possible, and we look forward to further improvement in the year ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Jim. Jim Vena : Thank you, Jennifer. Let's turn to Slide 19. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. Kenny outlined our view on the upcoming year. Our volume outlook today reflects headwinds from lost business, coal demand and relatively soft economic forecast. Much of that is out of our control. We are mitigating these impacts through business development and value creation by providing great service to our customers. Eric described the progress we've made to return our service levels to industry best, while there's work to do, the team made consistent improvement through the quarter to exit in a very fluid state. Obviously, winter is here, but that's part of railroading. I judge our success by how we minimize the impact on our customers and how quickly we recover the network. So far, we've grown - we've shown great resiliency. Finally, as Jennifer laid out, our productivity and pricing gains will be key to overcoming ongoing inflationary pressures in 2024 as well as the soft economy. While many unknowns remain, I'm confident we'll succeed in the areas we control. We've got plenty of opportunities this year to improve safety, service and operational excellence. As you heard me say in October, I came back to Union Pacific to win. My vision and the opportunity I see for this company has not changed. We have the right team and strategy in place to grow this railroad long term, and I'm very confident we'll see a better Union Pacific in the future. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Vena. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could ask just sort of the outlook for 2024. As you sit here, it sounds like a muted macro environment is keeping you cautious. But I guess when you think about the opportunities that you have, can volume be up this year? I know some of the macro indicators that you highlighted are muted, but they are still positive. So curious about volume growth. And I guess, in that context, with pricing maybe not necessarily being accretive to margin. Is there enough in that volume and some of the cost efficiencies that you guys are working on to get margin expansion? Jennifer Hamann : So Chris, maybe let me start and then Kenny can give you some more color. I mean we're just not going to give you a number in terms of what we think can happen with volumes because of what you yourself said. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and we just don't think it's prudent sitting here at the end of January to give you some sort of a forecast based on hopes for a second half recovery. Do we hope that, that will happen? And are we going to work diligently to move every piece of business that's there? Absolutely. And I think you really saw what the network can do with our fourth quarter performance, but we just need to see a little more certainty. And hopefully, that plays out through the year, and we can provide that. But sitting here today, we just don't see that. But Kenny, maybe talk about your margin... Kenny Rocker : I talked about it in my opening comments, there's a mixed bag of opportunities that are in front of us. We feel really good about the biofuels market. That market is growing. Demand is growing. We're capturing business in those markets. On the industrial side, we've had some record year on the construction side, still be a strong year. But as we are coming out of the gate with weather, that's going to be a little bit challenged for us. We feel really good about our petrochem business and wins that we've had from a business development perspective. On the petroleum and LPG side, those are all positive for us. On our premium business, again, those are really economic driven. And so we'll be looking to see what happens with demand overall. I talked about the international intermodal side and the loss there. We feel really encouraged by our ability to win on the auto side. And you heard us talk about Volkswagen [ph] win in last quarter. And so as there's a lot of demand there and the forecast for growth there, we really feel good about that market. Chris Wetherbee : Anything on the margins? Jennifer Hamann : I'm sorry? Jim Vena : Margins? Chris Wetherbee : Anything on the margins? Jennifer Hamann : On margins. Again, I'm not - this might become a broken record, I hope not. But I mean, we are not going to give specific guidance. I mean we're going to do everything we can as much as we can. And again, you saw what we did in the fourth quarter. But every kind of other guidance I would give is going to be predicated on what I think is going to happen with volumes, and we just don't have that clarity. And I don't think it's prudent to do that sitting here today. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Jim Vena : Chris, let me just maybe just try to put this all into a box of the way we're thinking. It's very difficult for us to look forward and say this is exactly the way the year is going to go. More important to me and the team is, what have we done operationally? And what are we doing to provide Kenny and the entire team, the capability to go out there and maximize what's available for us and what we can bring on to this railroad. And for me, that's the single most important thing. I think what we've shown is the capability to flex up. We have the assets to be able to flex up. We have the capacity to be able to flex up. And if we continue to drive the efficiency of the railroad, which I expect we will, then what we do is we win in the marketplace. And whatever is out there, we're going to compete against everybody else, trucks and other railroads, and we think we have a winning model, so that's the challenge we have. And it would be truly there would be a mistake for us to come out and say, because I can't tell what's going to happen, like Jennifer pointed out with the inputs and the effects from interest rates and everything else that's happening in the economy. But I'm very comfortable that we are going to maximize what's available for Union Pacific and win. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. On the intermodal side, I know there was a business loss there. And - but looking at some of the statistics in LA Long Beach, there seems to be a really good uptick in volumes into those regions or that region. Red Sea impact, perhaps East Coast is down. Kenny, are you seeing that there is new business coming that way? And could that be a nice offset to any business loss? Or could it create an opportunity for a business - more business wins as more volume shifts to LA Long Beach and perhaps the fluidity of LA Long Beach is that keeping pace with the new volume mix coming its way? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So thank you, Walter. We spent a lot of time looking at the global supply chains in the canals and so forth. I'll tell you right now in the near term, we haven't seen any significant shifts. We've been talking to our - the vessel carrier owners. We know they put in tariffs, our customers have put in tariffs to go over the Panama Canal, for example. And so we've been working with them to move as much as we can with the network that we have, with the match-back opportunities that we have, with the reload opportunities that we have, with the new products that we have on the - with the Houston lanes that Eric has given us to give our customers every reason to go to the West Coast. So what we have seen is we are seeing more going IPI, and we have a very efficient service network to accomplish that. We're happy about the customers that we have that have been able to grow in that market. And then finally, we have a great network where the service, we're able to capture that and get all of that business that's out there. Jim Vena : That' true, Kenny as we think about that because to your point, you can't predict the future with entire clarity. It's another reminder, Walter of the fact that when we talk about having a buffer and you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, we generated the ability to make sure we have that buffer. That buffer in locomotives, that buffer in railcars positioned in LA. So in the event the volume is there, we've supported Kenny's team to be able to actually capture it. Walter Spracklin : And the fluidity in the terminals right now? Is it - how would you assess that? Kenny Rocker : Very fluid. As you saw in the fourth quarter, 14% improvement in car velocity doesn't come unless you've got very fluid operations. Now to Jim's point, are there opportunities? Of course, there are. In fact, I'll talk about those as we go through this. But overall, right now, yes, very fluid. Walter Spracklin : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So it seems like you're framing this as there's things we can control and things we can't control. It strikes me that over time, the industry has been able to have some control over price. And you're talking about inflation up 5% and right now, yield x fuel is only up 1%, right? So it just seems we need more price. Can we get more price? I don't know. How do we think about that? And then can you just clarify like this international intermodal contract, when did we lose that? Because it sounded like it happened sometime in '23, but we just - we're seeing really good intermodal growth. So I'm a little confused with why we're flagging this is such a big issue right now. Thank you. Kenny Rocker : Thanks, Scott, I got both of those. Thank you. So first of all, you're exactly right. Prices are controllable. And let me make this clear. It's not like we are jumped up here and waited till January 1 to look at price. We've been going down this path here for a few months. You've heard Jennifer and I say that we have a set amount, call it, almost half that we can touch from a pricing standpoint. Our commercial team has really been very effective sitting down with customers, talking to them about the improved service product, talking to them about our increased inflationary pressures that we saw from the labor side and how Eric is leveraging that to improve the service products that we give them. They're seeing the same input. They're seeing the same increases. I've been meeting with customers. And so they know that. So yes, we control a portion of that, and so we've been very focused on articulating that story. I think you had a question on the international side. And yes, you're correct. We lost some of that earlier in the year, last year. The bulk of that will still be working through in 2024. Jennifer Hamann : But just to your question, Scott, I think what Kenny is talking about with that loss, that kind of goes to our discipline when it comes to price and making sure that the business that's on our railroad is running at acceptable margins. Sometimes that doesn't happen and we might lose a piece of business. Kenny Rocker : Yes. I mean with the service product, when the investments that you heard Eric talk about this morning, the margins have to be acceptable to be on the network. Jim Vena : Well, I hate to always recap these, and I won't. But let me recap this, Scott for you. So inflation, when I was - the first call that I had in October, I was pretty clear that we are going to deal with the inflationary pressure that is presented for us that we have to tackle, and we're doing it two ways. We are dealing with it on a price - from the price side, and we're also dealing with it on the efficiency side. And I think we have a clear view. This is not a short-term 3 months you can fix it on the price side and even on the efficiency side, we've seen improvements in efficiency, and you can see that from the number. And I think there's more available for us on the efficiency side from how we operate our trains, the fluidity and the terminals, how we use our people, and we did a really good job. The team did a fantastic job in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to get better as we go through the year. So those two things we're tackling head on. We're not being shy about it. We're being straight. I've met with a lot of customers in groups and in small and I've been clear about what the pressures are and what we're going to do about it moving forward. But at the end, we want our customers to win in the marketplace. We want them to win. So we're being smart about how we price and what level and it's different for different marketplaces, and that's how we're handling it. But I'm excited. I think we overcome this year, by the end of the year, we'll see ourselves in a different position. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. So Jim, you've seen - you realized a very fast and positive response in terms of the rail network operations since you've been at UP. Where do you think you're at in terms of kind of further improvements? So I don't know if you want to look at like locomotives, what the active fleet is and where it can go to. Maybe if you could comment a little bit on headcount. I think that the headcount was down pretty meaningfully sequentially. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of are we at the stable level now after that really quick improvement? Or our headcount and active locomotive fleet going to have further steps down as we go into '24? Jim Vena : Well, listen, thanks for the question. So the way I see it is this. I think there's more on the railroad to become more efficient. And the concentration is a little different than the last time I was here and a little different than what we just were able to do in the fourth quarter. I think there's opportunity in speed and car velocity that will help us be able to move the railcars faster, use a few less locomotives and be able to keep the network more fluid. But the real big piece for us and what we're going to concentrate on, and we think there's a capability to be much better is how fast we operate our terminals and the fluidity through the terminals to be able to have the products. Now it's just not in the transportation piece. We are looking at ways on the engineering side, how we do maintenance, how we do capital work on the mechanical side, how we - what it costs us to perform overhauls, every piece of the network is still there. So I think there's still more left on that piece to be able to do. Tom Wadewitz : Can you offer a thought on how that translates to headcount? Do we think headcount goes down further? Or is it kind of stable at current level? Jim Vena : Well, the challenge we have with headcount is we signed some collective agreements and you live with what was given to you. And some of those collective agreements put pressure on headcount. They put pressure on - from both the time off, the sick benefit time off that we provided. We had some weekends when the football game were on that we have like an extra 15%, 20% people all got sick at the same time. So we need to be able to figure out how to deal with that, and we'll do that as we move ahead. It must have been a real bad weekend, right? At the same time as one of their playoff games was on. But at the end of the day, those are stumbling - those are blocks that we have to get over this year. And what we showed in the fourth quarter is with all that, all the pluses and all the headwinds we had on headcount, we were able to keep the headcount and reduce it overall in the company. And there is no reason for us not to continue to do that. We will look for every opportunity. And sorry, I can't give you a specific number because this is a moving target. As we move ahead, we're implementing new agreements through this year. So it will be noisy. It won't be a straight tangent down. The scope won't be perfect. It will be a little up and down, but I'm very comfortable that we have the programs, the processes in place to be able to correct that and have the way which is less people handling the same amount of business. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. I was going to ask this anyway. I guess it's a perfect follow-up and maybe it's just reading between the lines. So when Eric mentioned some of the challenges remaining from the work agreements that required additional employees, I mean, it was noticeable to me that you stressed near term. So is this just - is there a time where this anniversaries, where you could be a lot more flexible based on the volume environment? Or was the stress on near term kind of related to what you were just mentioning, Jim, you're putting programs in place, you're trying to address it and that you hope at some point, you can kind of reverse that trend? Jim Vena : Yes. In the - in 2024, we have dates of implementation for the agreements that we have not implemented completely. And those are pressures on the number of people that we would need to operate. So that will be through 2024, and that's why I've always talked about this is a - I see this as a 2-year adjustment to the railroad to be able to get there. But we do have programs in place as we implement, we run into things if we operate as efficiently as I think we can, we'll mitigate that. You mitigate it by running less trains, having more cars on the same trains. We grow. We put more cars on the same trains instead of starting more. We use the people and the facilities that we have more efficiently. So - but it's a 2024 headwind for us that we are going to overcome just like we did in the fourth quarter. Jennifer Hamann : Well, just a reminder, Jon, we only have the work rest [ph] agreement in place with the BLET. We're still negotiating with SMART-TD. Jim Vena : Correct. Jon Chappell : Okay. Thank you, Jennifer. Thanks, Jim. Jim Vena : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Hey, guys. Hey, morning. Congrats on the good results. Jennifer, I want to come back to the 5% inflation. So you've got a $15 billion cost structure that basically translates to like $750 million of higher costs in '24. I assume that's a gross number because you've done - you guys have done a phenomenal job actually lowering the cost structures as we move from 3Q to 4Q. So is there any help you can give us in terms of how you think about that gross 5% translates to kind of like a net cost number in the context of the revenue outlook? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. No. I mean, you've got that exactly right, Amit. The 5% is the gross number. So that's our challenge, right, and opportunity is to offset that with productivity. And so that's where you heard Jim talk, you heard Eric mention, we have those opportunities in virtually every cost category, I'll put depreciation aside, that's kind of fixed for the year. But we absolutely have opportunities to offset that in terms of how we run the railroad. And I think just think about wage inflation and think about fourth quarter. So we had wage inflation first half of this year. Our wages are going to be up 4%. For our Union Personnel [ph] it's going to go to 4.5% in the second half, but our cost per employee was only up 1% in the fourth quarter. So that's productivity that's enabling us to offset some of that. And so that's the task of this management team, and that's those controllables that we talked about, and that's where we're very much focused. Amit Mehrotra : But is there any help? Like, I mean, can you offset half of it? Can you offset 40% of it? Like because that's obviously critical to understanding the EBIT and the margin outlook, which I know is highly uncertain, but at least give us some sense of how much you can offset that gross number by in your opinion? Jennifer Hamann : You also know, Amit, that the volumes play a role in that in terms of how we're able to leverage and build longer trains and have more work to put up against some of those inflationary costs. So that's our challenge, but I'm really not going to be able to give you any more than that. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I thought I'd try anyways. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Jennifer Hamann : Thank you. Jim Vena : Good question. Nice try. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. So obviously, service is improving here. Just in terms of customer engagement, any color on sort of the pipeline of opportunities? Is it starting to accelerate? Are there unique opportunities? And I guess along with that, are you seeing any improvement in some of the conversion of some opportunities out there? Just any thoughts. Thanks. Jim Vena : Allison, let me start and then Kenny, please jump in. So if we look at this railroad that we are blessed with that we operate, and I think you've seen some of the steps we've taken is you have to provide a level of service that we sold to our customers, and that's our goal, and we work real hard every day to do that. We operate the railroad very efficiently. Where's the opportunity? We have a mix of traffic that's available to us that originates on our railroad, so when I go around the entire railroad, I'm very comfortable that we offset and we have the capability to offset and we are tackling, whether it's that industrial complex all the way from New Orleans to Brownsville, Texas, whether it's the grain, whether it's the soda ash, whether it's the intermodal at the West Coast and our speed. We are able to provide speed for customers that require speed and not all of them do. We can go from LA to Texas, a close to 2,000 mile journey and we do that in 48 hours. So that's truck like. So - and our service that we put on from Mexico going into Eastern Canada, partnering with CN and ourselves into the East plus into Chicago is unparalleled. We can do it as fast as anybody. So there's lots of opportunity out there for us. And what we have to do is with good service, the customers will see what's possible, and they will want to partner with Union Pacific and grow their business with us versus anybody else. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So first of all, we have a robust business development pipeline. It's a healthy one. It's an encouraging one. We're excited about the pipeline in front of us, so a lot of opportunities there. The main thing I want to start with is our service product is in a strong position. And so as we talk about the service that we sold to customers, you look at some of the markets, just to get a little bit more detail here. Look at coming out of Mexico, that's a service product that Eric has given us daily. That's undisputed and unmatched coming out of Mexico. It's the fastest product. It's also a product that is on time. You look at the West Coast and someone asked me a question earlier, we're blessed with a network where we can pitch and we can catch. We can pitch coming out of the West Coast as we onboard and on dock. We've got a strong IPI. We can catch in the Inland Empire. We built that up. We put investments there, and we've shared with you that we've got plans to really grow in that area. And with the network and the service product we have, we're expecting to grow. If you look at the carload side, you've heard us talk about some of the wins in the auto side. I talked about the petrochem side. That's a great network down in the Gulf Service Park [ph] is improving. Our commercial leaders, commercial teams are sitting out there and talking to customers about taking a little bit more truck off the road. So we're bullish on getting out there and growing as the service product is there, and we're investing in the network. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Eric, I wanted to come back to you because I think in response to an earlier question, you spoke about, there's still more to come on things like velocity and train length. And then I think Jim even alluded to some local service plan changes. So do you want to elaborate a little bit more on where you see productivity gains this year? Eric Gehringer : Absolutely. So you mentioned car velocity, so let's start there. As you're thinking about 2024 and what's in front of us, you saw what we did in the fourth quarter, a 14% improvement, 217 miles per day. That becomes a floor. A floor that is we work every single day, as was mentioned before, we're working to improve that. Now if you peel that back and you say, okay, within that, where do you see the biggest opportunities? You mentioned train length, so we can start there. Train length is an opportunity, always has been and candidly always will be because the railroad is dynamic. Train length comes in two forms. The first one, Kenny just gave a great example of Inland Empire, where we're bringing more volume onto the railroad. I already have an existing train, and we can just tack it onto the back of that. The other way that it comes is in our actual transportation plan changes that we make. An example of that is the one that Kenny brought up with Mexico. When you think about that being two trains before and now we're consolidating that traffic into one, it allows us to drive productivity that way. After that, the fluidity drives our locomotive fleet. There's other factors, but at the very core of it, it is about fluidity. We took out 500 units out of the system in the second half of last year, a little bit because of volume, but the vast, vast majority of it because of fluidity, continuing that work allows us to continue to rightsize the fleet. And we don't talk a lot about purchase services on these calls, but purchase service is a big opportunity for us, whether you're thinking about how many vehicles do we have on this railroad to operate it, whether we think about how much fuel that we're using. We also have opportunities on the casualty side. As Jennifer has mentioned many times before, it's an opportunity all the way from the safety side. That's why we're so focused on safety as well as even as we think about our service product, right? We have teams that are dedicated to making sure that the freight that we haul is successfully hauled from origin to destination without being damaged and how do we drive down any claims that we have. So it is a target-rich environment, and we are doing everything every day to capitalize on that. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Following up on the locomotive piece earlier, you talked about storing 500 units and having a 9% sequential increase in productivity. Jim, as you look forward a bit further, can you talk about how you think about UP's fleet renewal strategy for locomotives over the next, call it, 3 to 5 years? And how at this point is some of the regulations that California is proposing impacting the way that you think strategically about that significant investment for the railroad? Thank you. Jim Vena : Bascome, I think it's a great question. If you looked at the bottom line, we have enough locomotives that we would not have to look in the planning period of 3 years out that we would have to purchase any locomotives. But we always look at the greenhouse gas emissions of our locomotives, what we need to do to be able to invest to make them more efficient, both on a fuel spend and greenhouse gas emissions. So I think we will target certain capital expenditures. It's not in the plan this year, and we'll look at it again to see where we are. We're testing new innovative ways to have propulsion. So we'll continue to do that and invest in locomotives that can be hybrid that are able to work out there for us. So and in certain situations, we can implement it. But I don't see the requirement is that we do not have to spend money. But bottom line is we know that we will invest in our fleet. And we don't want to have the oldest fleet in the network. So we'll continue to invest in renewing the fleet as we move ahead, but it will not happen in 2024. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Jim Vena : You're welcome, Bascome, Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning and congrats on solid and rapid results here. Just want to check, I guess you're not changing that you don't need volume gains to get margin improvement. Is that right? Am I hearing that right? And then your thoughts on outpacing normal sequential shifts into the first quarter, should we still expect that like you did in the fourth quarter, given the weather or accelerating gains? And then just a side one, Kenny, I just want to understand, are you - can you talk about the scale of the intermodal loss in '24? Did we see it in the fourth quarter? Or is that all coming? And can you talk scale? I guess that was a surprise, I think, to everybody so far. Jim Vena : Okay. So three questions, Ken. That was very good. I like - so why don't we start... Jennifer Hamann : Where are we going to start? Jim Vena : Why don't we start with the contract is real simple. The contract was lost early in 2023, and the business has actually lost starting January 1 correct, Ken? Kenny Rocker : That's true. We'll still see the bulk of it still showing up in 2024. Jim Vena : So that's the challenge. It's a 2024 issue. And it was early in 2023 that we lost that business. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And if I can, in terms of your margin questions, again, not going to give you any specifics there. We have three levers, as you know, that we use to attack and generate profitability. It's volume, price and productivity. You've heard us talk about the fact in my prepared comments that price were all positive in excess of inflation dollars is not going to be accretive to margins here in 2024. We are unsure about the volume picture. There's a lot of puts and takes, as you heard, and we know we've got some headwinds from a contract loss in coal. And so the lever that we are most confident about and have ultimate control over is the productivity side. And so you're right, we have shown in periods of declining volumes in the past that we can through productivity and price generate margin improvement. But we're not giving you a guidance on what - any kind of magnitude of volume changes. So I don't want to try to get into that game of linking x amount of volume with x amount of productivity and margin. The thing that you will see from us in our results, regardless of what happens with volume is that we're performing better. We're running better. We're running more efficiently and driving productivity. And whether that results in positive or negative in the financial picture is going to be a function of some of that volume and how that plays out through the quarter and through the year. First quarter, in particular, is going to be a bit of a challenge for us. Volume, yes, and the weather, you heard us talk about that. But a couple of other things just to remind everyone of in terms of a year-over-year comparison. Last year, we had about $100 million, a little over $100 million real estate transaction that was in our earnings. And we also had a very strong fuel benefit in the first quarter of last year and helped our margins by, I think, almost 2 points and about $0.25. So I just want to remind everybody of those kind of year-over-year comparison pressures. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate the multiple part answers to my one question. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. And maybe taking a shot at asking that question a little bit differently, Jim, you've now been at the company for roughly a couple of quarters. Do you have any updated thoughts on the size of the total productivity opportunity going forward? And roughly how much of that is dependent on volume growth. If we want to make our own assumption that volumes are flattish this year, hypothetically, is that a scenario where you can still see meaningful margin expansion year-over-year? Jim Vena : Listen, I think it was a well-framed question. I like it because it gets to the crux of who we are at Union Pacific and what the vision is and what our goals and objectives are. I'm very clear on it. I think we are going to have quarters just like the first quarter, but maybe we don't see as much of a sequential improvement as we would like because of the pressures of what we had in January so far with weather, and I'm not sure what's going to happen. I've been around for way too long to forecast what's going to happen when winter is on and when we come through spring and everything that can happen then. But fundamentally, I see us as having a best operating ratio in the industry. And that's what we're driving towards, and we'll get there. And I see it in the future, and the future is not so far that it's cloudy. I see it clearly in what we have to do. So for me, that's really important. And I don't care whether we - whether the business and the business in the marketplace gives us business or not. But I'll tell you, I'm pretty clear, okay? We have a great railroad. We operate very efficiently. We should win with the customers, and I expect Kenny and his team to deliver. This is not - people want to talk about we lost the business. We need to go replace that and we need to bring it on and we need to do that in the short term, not the long term, without going after making an adjustment on price to go get the business. We have that capability, and we can deliver value to the customer. That's how I think. and I did not come back here. I could have sat at home in Scottsdale or being somewhere doing some exciting hiking or mountaineering, but I decided to come back because I think we could win, and we have the railroad and the network to do that. So the pressure is on this team. The pressure is on Eric to make sure and his entire team to deliver, recover fast like we did with this last winter impact that we had. I expect Kenny to deliver. And I expect Jennifer and the entire team to look for every opportunity, how we monetize what we have as a railroad and win. So I love the question. Perfect. So hopefully, I answered it for you. Justin Long : You did. Thanks, Jim. Jim Vena : You're welcome. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yeah, thanks. Good quarter and by the way, Jennifer, I do like that last slide is helpful. The - my question relates to Mexico. Obviously, that's an initiative that you guys really tried to accelerate last year. And then around the end of the year, there were the border closures. Just thinking through how you expect that business to trend moving forward? And if you're seeing a lot of these reshoring things? Or are some of these interruptions causing any second guessing of that at all? Jim Vena : So Kenny talk about the business and how we see it? And then if you don't mind, I'm going to answer the piece on the border, okay? Kenny Rocker : Sure. Yes. I mean, Ben, the near shoring, Israel [ph]. We've seen the billions that have gone in, in all of 2023. These are - a number of them are highly industrial and rail centric, which we find encouraging. I talked about the service product that we have, and we're not waiting around for the near shoring to happen. We've seen some wins with us having the fastest product coming out of Mexico, especially in time-sensitive products like auto parts, again, a daily service. We're reaching into the Midwest. We're reaching into different parts of Canada. And so we're encouraged by that. We're bullish about that. We are talking to customers about that. We're putting as much as we can on the network. And you also saw us create a service product into the Southeast, which we have gained some traction on. So again, coming out of Mexico, it's a great franchise for us. We've got six borders that we can get in and out of Mexico. So great product and great franchise. Jim Vena : You bet. And on the border, I'm disappointed that the border was shut down, and I do not think that's the way to move forward. I think there is a problem. There's a humanitarian issue. I personally went down with some members of the team to go visit. And it's very difficult when you see people crossing the river and the mother with a child coming and then falling into some razor wire. That is not something that anybody should see. But at the end of the day, for us, I think it's more important that the border crossings are fluid, and we are doing everything, investing in systems to make sure we protect the railway crossings that we do not have people crossing on the trains. And we've done a really good job of that. People are not crossing coming across from Mexico into the U.S. or vice versa on the trains, and that's what we will continue to do. And we will work close with customs and we have. Customs understand they have a problem, and we've worked very closely with them, and we will continue to have meetings and discussions so that we will do everything we can to make sure that the rail operation is not impacted as we move forward. Ben Nolan : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, everyone. You guys said that you're looking to push on rail length, which is train length is understandable. Just want to see kind of how much room you have to kind of get more leverage there, A, kind of given your efforts already kind of how much more like physical space is there. Also, I think given some of the kind of regulatory scrutiny around train lengths kind of is this something that you guys can do by yourself? Or do you need to get the kind of STB or Congress is going to sign off on it? Jim Vena : Yes. Thank you for that question. So core to your question is how do we think about train length and how do we execute that? So let's put volume to the side just for a second. Do our trains have capacity for more train length? Absolutely, yes, 100%. The work that we have in front of us that we've been executing now for years and will continue to is to make sure that all of our systems behind the scenes continue to first identify those opportunities. And as we've always been to be exceptionally prudent about actually working through our physics engines and to understand exactly how to build our trains. That's science. And like all science, it evolves. And every quarter, every year, we see new opportunities to be able to keep capitalize on this. So I'm not going to guide you to a specific number, but I'm going to tell you, we see some opportunity there. You'll see us capitalize it in '24, and I'm excited and appreciate what the team is doing to make that happen. Thank you, Ravi. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up first on the work rest rules. Is there anything in your guidance, where you're assuming that SMART-TD actually does come on board? Or so far, you're just assuming that it's the BLE. And then maybe for Kenny, obviously mix is probably harder to forecast than volume, but the two are related. So maybe you can just give us a sense in terms of some of these market pricing adjustments for coal and intermodal that have been more of a headwind than not the last couple of quarters. Is that something that we should anticipate also being a potential headwind into next year? Just curious how much visibility you have on that, knowing that it's probably truck and natural gas dependent. But I guess is that directionally worse in '24 than perhaps it was in '23? Thank you. Jim Vena : Jennifer, why don't you handle the... Jennifer Hamann : In terms of the work rest piece, we do have an assumption that we'll come to an agreement probably sometime later in the year. So that's part of our overall thinking. Kenny Rocker : So you look - you asked the question about intermodal, domestic intermodal. First of all, if you look at where the rates have been, I'll differentiate the spot rates of the last 4 months sequentially, shown, I'll call it, very slow gradual increase, which is encouraging. The same issue on the contractual side, very slow gradual improvement sequentially the last 4 months. So I can't get into saying whether I think over the next 3 months, that's going to continue. We've got a lot of mixed feedback from customers, but encouraged by what we've seen in the past. I've said this before that we have mechanisms in our contracts for our suite of customers to keep them competitive, real time and times like this. And as the market improves, I would just mention some of those indices, it will help us some of those mechanisms that we have to procure a little bit more price and better margin. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And Brian, I think you also asked a broader mix question in terms of next year. And obviously, with a lot of unknowns about volume, it's hard to answer that. But the big drivers there really are in the intermodal front. And largely so goes intermodal, so goes the broader mix for UP. We obviously have mix within mix [ph] As I know you're also aware. And so when you think about just the premium category with automotive being very bullish on that as we think about some of the contract wins and what's happening in that market, that may help your overall premium mix, particularly if you've got some down, and then we'll see how the rest of the categories play out. But that's the big swing factor for us in 2024. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. A couple of just real quick follow-ups or clarifications. One, I don't know if I caught the order of magnitude impact of the international intermodal loss, whether it be revenue or volume? And then secondly, what does it mean price not being accretive to margin? Does that mean overall yields would it best be flat? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. For the second part of your question, Jordan, it really just means mathematically, when you look at how the price impacts and is added to the revenue, it does not help your overall operating ratio calculation. Even though it's going to be higher than the inflation. Jim Vena : So when you do the math, you know that math, right? Kenny Rocker : So again, we're not going to frame up the magnitude. I can tell you, we're focused on growing the international intermodal network. We've been blessed with a new intermodal terminal there in Phoenix. It's going to open up February 1. I talked about some of the other products that we have coming out of Houston. We've talked about Mexico. So again, we're bullish and we want to make sure that we're moving that product at the appropriate margin, acceptable margin. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Jim Vena : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Tacking on to Jordan's question there. If we were to look at pricing and exclude sort of intermodal and sort of the natural gas impacts and some of the linked coal contracts, would pricing be accretive to margin in the remainder of the business? And also, as I look in that near-shoring commentary, how should we think about sort of post '24 in near shoring? Where is that going to show up for you guys? And is there any extra CapEx that might be needed? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. We're just not going to get into that final level of detail, but certainly, those are substantial headwinds for us that have been impacting our yields through much of 2023, and the intermodal piece for sure is going to linger into 2024. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So post 2024, as you look at it, I mentioned a lot of industrial base markets that are going there. Think in terms of auto, think in terms of metals and minerals, think in terms of petrochemical market. Jason Seidl : Perfect. Appreciate the time, as always, everyone. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up on the near shoring for Kenny. A lot of the companies we talk to say really all that's been done at this point is concrete has been poured in the ground and some of these facilities have been announced. And really, you're not going to see a lot of this potential until kind of '25, '26, '27? Looking at your industrial development plan and kind of what's out there, do you think - and I'm going to ask you to guess here. Could this be 100 basis points in magnitude to volume on a basis over 3 to 5 years? Could it be larger than that? How should we think about scoping this longer-term industrial development opportunity for UNP? Kenny Rocker : We're certainly not going to guide on your basis point question. Here's what I will say, though, and I've repeated this, and I want to make sure I hit this pretty hard. We've got a service product coming out of Mexico that is unmatched. It's a daily product. It's the fastest product to getting in and out of the heart of Mexico. We also have 6 gateways, which gives us optionality, which gives our customers optionality, which gives us an opportunity to hit different parts of Mexico. So yes, we feel very bullish about Mexico and the growth, and we've been working from an industrial development perspective with all the stakeholders with all the customers to help bring that on. Jim Vena : The only thing I would add is with the ownership position we have in the FXC, I think that ties us even to be able to optimize what's available to us as near shoring happens and as we work collaboratively and make it the view as one railroad operationally, it will help us on the efficiency of being able to move the traffic. And I think we're able to offer the customers the best product, and we think it gives us a chance to win a bigger majority of any business that's added to those lanes. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question. Jairam Nathan : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on the casualty and I guess on the other expenses on the last slide, you have flat to down, it looks like casualty will be - would be favorable here. So can you talk about some things that could kind of offset that? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. On the call, I mentioned the fact that we've had some higher casualty expenses certainly over the last couple of years, and we've been playing some catch up. And so that's really a large part of what's driven the increase in those lines - in that line and the other line. And so we don't expect that to continue because it's not indicative of our safety performance. And in fact, you've heard us talk about being very focused on improving that overall performance. It really is some cleanup and some maybe outsized verdicts, too, just with some of what's going on in the courts. And we think we have some of those big things behind us. So looking forward to a better footing in 2024. Jairam Nathan : Okay. And finally, just on the CapEx question. Jimmy talked about FXE. In terms of capital additions would FXE be on the same page as you guys in terms of investing in the business? Jim Vena : Yes, they have the same capability. They do a real good job. I'm on the Board and so is Jennifer, and they have a great plan for 2024 and they invest in their railroad, the same as we do, bottom up, build the plan up to see what you need. So I'm very comfortable that they will invest and have the capability to invest what they need to move forward. Jairam Nathan : Okay. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, guys, thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Sorry? Jim Vena : I said they put you last David? David Vernon : It's been happening since the second grade. The last name is V, you should be - you should feel familiar with that process. Jim Vena : You and I were always called last, I hear you. David Vernon : Exactly, exactly. So a couple of questions for you here. First, the CapEx moderation, Kenny, you a little bit worried about how that's going to impact you for growth? And then second, given your exposure to the situation down in Mexico, Jim, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you think the introduction of passenger rail might do down in Mexico in terms of freight flows coming cross-border? Any perspective or insight you can share in terms of the response that FXE I think, had to give to the Mexican government in the last couple of weeks. Thanks. Jim Vena : So Kenny, let me ask the question. Would we plan our capital, do we ever limit the capital. So you have a problem for growth? Kenny Rocker : Not at all. Jim Vena : Perfect. That's the way we look at it. It's that simple, never. So let me clear up this whole, David, because it's a great question. And you know the answer. So you're asking me, and you've heard it before, and I'm very clear on this. We build our capital plan from the bottom up to look at what we need to reinvest in the railroad and every year is a little bit different. Ties, rail equipment. We look at growth and what we've identified of where we need to invest. We're opening February 1, a new intermodal terminal in Phoenix. So we've invested in that. We're a quick turnaround. We don't fool around anymore. That would have been like a 6-month, 1-year discussion. We turned around and in November, said there's a market there. And February 1, we're opening up a place. So we're able to invest quick, and that's the way I look at it. When we built it up, we came up with $3.4 billion. That is not a hard number. If there's an opportunity for us to invest to grow this company or invest that we need to on the replacement and the - what we do every day to operate the railroad, we'll invest. And we never ever skimp on safety, maintenance of the railroad, the capital cost we need and the growth. So we are there. I have no issue. And on the passenger service, listen, I give both the FXE and CPKC. They're saying the right things, and I agree with them. We - there's an interaction when you have passenger service that affects you, but there's nothing that you - that I'm worried about because they can't figure out how to mitigate that and still operate a freight and passenger railroad efficiently. So I'm very comfortable that, that will not have a significant effect or really any effect as they move ahead. I'm sure that they will just move ahead and they'll be operating some passenger service on the railroad. So hopefully, we answered your question, David. David Vernon : You did. Thanks very much. Jim Vena : Thanks. Operator, Rob, maybe if I can just soon as we're done with the questions, I wouldn't mind just recapping and if there's a few people on, that's great. And if everybody else has got off, then I'm talking to my team here, and they love to hear the story. So bottom line is, this is - we have a great railroad. We have a franchise that allows us with the business mix to go up and down with - because not one area ever. And you wish 1 year that every segment that we had industrial premium, okay, and the bulk would all grow at one time, that's not the way the world is. I've never seen it in my career. We need to be able to have the resiliency and the capability to react on what's happening. We don't know what's going to happen this year, but I'm telling you, fundamentally, we are on the right track to deliver. The team is engaged. We're excited and we're looking forward to winning this year. We have goals to grow revenue with our service, and we also have goals to be the most efficient operationally railroad in the industry. So I'm looking forward to 2024. I'm excited. The team is excited, and I'm looking forward to talking to all of you in 3 months and see how the first quarter went and to see how we're growing and what we've done at this point. So thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.+",

[Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin. Vincenzo Vena : Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Beautiful day in Omaha, 60 degrees, a little bit of rain. It is absolutely perfect for railroading. So why don't we get started? And thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's first quarter results.  I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As you'll hear from the team, we continue to execute our multiyear strategy to establish Union Pacific as the industry leader in safety, service and operational excellence. We, again, took positive steps towards that goal in the first quarter. While challenges outside our control persists, we are establishing a foundation for long-term success.  Now let's discuss first quarter results starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 1st quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.69 per share. This compares to 2023 1st quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. We're pleased to be able to report earnings growth in a tough environment, especially since last year's results included a $0.14 per share real estate gain. First quarter operating revenue was flat as solid core pricing gains and a positive business mix were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and reduced volumes. Normalizing for the impact from fuel surcharge, freight revenue was up 4% versus last year. Expenses year-over-year were down 3%, driven by lower fuel prices and productivity gains. This was partially offset by inflation, increased transportation workforce levels to compensate for new labor agreements and higher depreciation. Our first quarter operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points versus last year. This also represents a 20 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter, which further demonstrates the strong work by the team. Look, it's a great start to the year. I'm pleased with how the Union Pacific team is coming together to unlock what's possible for our company. But there's a lot of work to do. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail, and I'll come back and wrap it up before we go to question and answer. So with that, Jennifer, why don't you go through the first quarter financials? Jennifer Hamann : All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with a walkdown of our first quarter income statement on Slide 5, where operating revenue of $6 billion was flat versus last year on a 1% volume decline that was significantly driven by a 20% reduction in coal shipments. In fact, excluding coal, volumes would have been up close to 2% year-over-year even in this tough freight environment.  Looking in at the revenue components further, total freight revenue of $5.6 billion declined 1%. The single largest driver of the year-over-year decrease was a 25% reduction in fuel surcharge revenue to $665 million as lower fuel prices negatively impacted freight revenue 375 basis points. Solid core pricing gains and a favorable business mix combined to add 350 basis points to freight revenue. Reduced coal and rock shipments as well as increased soda ash and petroleum carloads drove the positive mix dynamic. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 4%, a solid start to the year and a demonstration of the great diversity of the UP franchise. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue increased 4%, driven by increased accessorial revenue that included a one-time contract settlement of $25 million. Switching to expenses, operating expense of $3.7 billion decreased 3%, as we generated solid productivity against lower demand. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 4% versus last year. First quarter workforce levels decreased 2% as reductions in non-transportation employees more than offset a 4% increase in our active TE&Y workforce. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced, we continue to carry additional train services employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of newly available sick pay benefits and work rest agreements.  While talking about workforce levels, I do want to mention one quick housekeeping item. As some of you might be aware, we are in the process of transferring operating responsibility for certain passenger lines in Chicago to Metro. As part of that, in June, we will be transferring around 350 mechanical employees to Metro. On a quarterly basis, this will lower both revenue and expense by roughly $15 million. Cost per employee in the first quarter increased 5%, reflecting wage inflation and additional costs associated with new labor agreements. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 14% on a 13% decrease in fuel prices from $3.22 per gallon to $2.81 per gallon. We also improved our fuel consumption rate by 1% as locomotive productivity more than offset a less fuel-efficient business mix given the decline in coal shipments. Purchased Services & Materials expense decreased 6% versus last year, as we maintained a smaller active locomotive fleet, and our logistics subsidiary incurred less drayage expense. In addition, a little less than half of the year-over-year variance related to resolution of a contract dispute. Finally, Equipment & Other Rents declined 8%, reflecting a more fluid network seen through improved cycle times and lower lease expenses. By controlling the controllables in our cost structure, first quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 3% versus last year. Below the line, Jim noted last year's real estate transaction and other income, and our interest expense declined 4% on lower average debt levels. First quarter net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.69 both improved 1% versus 2023. And our quarterly operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points year-over-year, which includes a 60 basis point headwind from lower fuel prices.  Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on Slide 6. First quarter cash from operations totaled $2.1 billion, up roughly $280 million versus last year. Growth in operating income as well as the impact from 2023 labor agreement payments are reflected in that increase. In addition, free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate both showed nice improvements. As planned, we paid down $1.3 billion of debt maturities in March. That resulted in our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio declining to 2.9x at the end of the quarter, and we continue to be A-rated by our 3 credit rating agencies. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $795 million. Wrapping things up on Slide 7. As you'll hear from Kenny, our overall outlook on the freight environment hasn't changed a lot since January. Yes, there have been some pluses and minuses from our original outlook, but in totality, we still see the same economic uncertainty. What I am certain of, however, is that our service product is meeting and will continue to meet the demand in the marketplace. And when volumes strengthen, we will be ready to provide our customers with the service they need to grow with us. In addition, as evidenced by our first quarter results, we will continue to generate productivity that improves our network efficiency.  Also demonstrated by those first quarter results is our commitment to generating pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. If you set fuel aside, our price commitment as well as expectations for positive mix in 2024 should allow us to pace freight revenue ahead of volume.  And finally, with capital allocation, we plan to start -- restart share repurchases in the second quarter, a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our strategy and the momentum that is building. The actions we're taking to improve safety, service and operational excellence are reflected in our financials, and continuing on with this strategy will drive shareholder value in 2024 and well into the future. Let me turn it over to Kenny now to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was down 1% as core pricing was offset by lower fuel surcharges and a 1% drop in volume. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 4% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Solid core pricing gains across most Bulk segments were largely offset by low natural gas prices that unfavorably impacted our coal index contracts and lower on fuel surcharges. As stated, coal continued to face difficult market conditions in the first quarter as warmer temperatures overall led to record low natural gas prices and caused significant declines in demand. Grain and grain products volume was up for the quarter with increased shipments of corn to Mexico as well as more shipments from Canadian origins. Lastly, despite strong truck competition, food and refrigerated shipments increased as a result of new business for dry goods solid demand and network service improvement.  Moving to Industrial. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, driven by a 1% increase in volume. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on windows of opportunity along with new domestic contract wins. Demand improved for our Petrochemicals business in both export and domestic markets. However, challenges with high inventories and weather negatively impacted our rock volumes. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 1% increase in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, along with continued strength from dealer inventory replenishment. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by strong international West Coast demand, which was partially offset by the international contract loss I mentioned in January and soft market conditions in domestic intermodal.  Turning to Slide 10. Here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as inventories are projected to be at record levels and natural gas futures remain depressed. We are hopefully watching grain, particularly as it relates to new crop conditions and fourth quarter export demand. We expect domestic grain demand to be stable. Lastly, we are optimistic about grain products, as we continue to see growth in biofuel feedstocks. Additionally, we recently won incremental grain products business out of Iowa that started moving earlier this year by demonstrating our consistent service products and developing competitive solutions to support our customer's business. Turning to Industrial. The rock market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volume. However, we expect petroleum and petrochem markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development, supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast and operational excellence.  And finally, for Premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see consistent, strong West Coast imports in the near term, but it's still too early to predict what will happen in the back half of the year. On the domestic intermodal side, we continue to see market softness, but expect our strong service products and diversified set of IMC and private asset partners will set us up well when demand returns. For Automotive, we will see continued strength due to our business development wins and improved OEM production. In summary, coal and domestic intermodal will put pressure on our volumes this year, but the team has taken action. As you saw in the first quarter, excluding fuel, we were able to grow revenue even as we face lower volumes overall. I am confident that with our improved service products, we will continue to win new business and take trucks off the road. On the price side, we are having deliberate conversations with customers on price increases to overcome inflationary pressures. And those conversations are backed up by an efficient service product that Eric's team has given to our customers so that they can compete and win.  We have a great franchise, along with being the premier cross-border rail provider to and from Mexico that positions us well to serve markets in both the U.S. and Mexico. Our legacy service and the new service offerings we've added allows us to win in the marketplace, and we see strong opportunities in front of us to grow with our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. We exited 2023 with strong operational momentum across the board. And while weather quickly presented its challenges, the team rose to the task. The speed with which our service product recovered is a testament to our strategy and the resiliency of our network. We continue to see meaningful year-over-year improvements in our metrics. This is a direct result of our steadfast focus on providing industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence. Starting with Freight Car Velocity. Improvements in terminal dwell and overall network fluidity led to a 4% improvement compared to first quarter 2023. Sequentially, Freight Car Velocity declined 6%, primarily due to shifts in product mix between our Bulk, Manifest and Intermodal services. Particularly, we are seeing an impact from declines in Intermodal and Bulk shipments, which generally contribute higher average daily car miles. Key is that our service product remains consistent, and we are delivering what we sold to our customers. We want our customers to win. And if they win, we win. To further deliver on the service we sold to our customers, we recently introduced a new measure Service Performance Index, or SPI. As the name implies, it's a combined metric that reflects the actual service provided, and we believe it's a better measure than trip plan compliance alone. For those customers with specific transit commitments, we measure against that. And for the many customers who rely on our historical performance to inform their rail transportation planning decision, SPI provides a measure that aligns with this practice. For the first quarter, both Intermodal and Manifest and Auto SPI saw a sizable 14 and 7-point year-over-year improvement, respectively. The team also delivered safety performance in the quarter, both on derailment and personal injury fronts. As we continue to emphasize the culture of safety, we're also investing in technology and process, ensuring our employees have the tools they need to operate safely and efficiently. Our goal is clear, we want to lead the industry and drive tangible change so everyone goes home safely each day.  Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. While maintaining focus on enhancing safety and service, it is equally crucial that we do so in a cost-effective manner, enabling Kenny and the team to compete in a broader range of markets. In alignment with this objective, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our first quarter metrics, indicating that the efficiency of our railroad is on the right track. Locomotive productivity improved 10% compared to first quarter 2023, as the team continues to run an efficient operation and a transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives to satisfy the demands of the business. In fact, we have reduced our active fleet by about 500 locomotives compared to last year.  Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 1% as average daily car miles declined slightly and employees decreased 2% compared to 2023. While overall workforce counts declined, our train, engine and yard employees increased 4%, as we continue to support our training pipeline, scheduled work agreements and provide the capacity buffer necessary to navigate an ever-changing environment. Train length improved 1% compared to first quarter 2023. After a particularly challenging January due to winter weather, we quickly adjusted to set train length records in both February and March. Notably, manifest train length increased by around 300 feet. While train length increased for nearly all train categories year-over-year, declines in intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, moderated sequential performance. Although we are encouraged by these results, there are ample opportunities ahead for us to further improve asset utilization and the efficiency of our network. For instance, we are leveraging technology to automate terminal functions and engineering renewal activities, increasing energy management utilization to improve fuel consumption and developing car plan optimizers to reduce car touches. While these are just a few of key initiatives, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for all our stakeholders is vital. And as we move forward, we will continue pushing the envelope in our pursuit of industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Vincenzo Vena : Thank you, Eric. Turning now to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer and Kenny, our volume outlook in some markets continues to be challenged. We are mitigating those challenges by driving efficiency in the network, which is driving stronger financial returns, and this provides confidence to start repurchasing shares in the second quarter.  Kenny provided you with an overview of the first quarter volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the year. Coal is going to be a headwind. It is what it is. We need to outperform what our markets give us naturally to offset that impact. And if we provide the service we sold to our customers, I'm confident they'll grow with us. It's also imperative that we generate pricing for the value we're providing our customers.  Lastly, Eric walked you through the progress we're making across safety, service and operational excellence. When I look at how we're performing, I see improvement across the board. The network is operating fluidly and efficiently, allowing us to meet the demand in the market. And that drove the financial success, as you saw here in the first quarter. There's certainly more to do, but we're on the right path.  At the end of the day, we're demonstrating continuous improvement, getting a little better each day. In the long run, our focus on being the best across the spectrum will generate sustainable long-term value for the years ahead. One final item for you all, a Save the Date. We are planning an Investor Day on September 18 and 19 in Dallas, Texas. More details to follow, but we're excited to lay out more of our vision to demonstrate what's possible for this great company of ours.  And with that, Rob, we're ready to take on some of the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : So it seems like the operations are working pretty well, Jim. I'd like you to maybe talk about kind of what you're doing with Kenny and his team to start focusing on growth that's maybe different or hasn't been done at UNP in the past. We know there's been a couple of the joint services with the CN and the Falcon and stuff like that. But internally in terms of focusing the team on more business development efforts, can you just kind of talk to us a little bit about what kind of changes you're making or what kind of initiatives you're emphasizing to start driving a little bit more growth on the networks? Vincenzo Vena : You bet. David, thanks for the question. And I'll just summarize real quick what we're doing. And then, Kenny, maybe you want to get into a little bit more of the specifics, okay? So if we look at what we're doing on the railroad side, and that's very important in how we're going to be able to grow and grow with our customers is our customers -- some customers we have expect speed and resiliency in the model. And others, it is -- speed is less of a concern. It is consistency in the model. So if you take a look at what we're doing, we are building the fundamental blocks that we are able to provide a service like no one else. We can go from and we're out there selling it. So in the high-speed market to market, we have a service that operates very high speed, 2,000 miles in less than 2 days, that makes us competitive against other modes of transportation.  If we look at the consistency, we want our customers to win. And the best way for us to grow is with the customers that we have, whether it's the automobile business that we handle, whether it's the export business that we handle, whether it's in the Gulf, whether it's our access into Mexico and our interchanges with the other railroads and how we can originate, and we all win together. So we're doing all of that. I'm spending -- Eric might say, I'm not -- he wishes I would spend more time on some other things, so I still look at the operation. It's still there. I think there's a lot more that needs to be delivered.  And when you do an analysis, and the way I like to do a regression analysis on what the operation is like, I'm comfortable, but there's more to do. And the pressure is on to be more consistent and faster and be able to deliver a better service product. We do that, we win. But I've also spent a lot of time with Kenny and his team and myself personally, meeting with customers, understanding what they need to win, our present customers and future customers. And I think we continue down this path with consistent service. And the value that we can provide to customers for them to grow is such that they want to partner with UP, and we want to partner with them because we want our customers to win, and I really like where we are. And if we can keep this consistency, David, going, which I'm very confident we can, then I think, Kenny, I hate to tell you, it should be pretty easy for you to grow the business in a way you go. Kenny Rocker : All right. So look, David, you hit it on the head. What are we doing differently? And I just want to talk to you about some of the product development that Eric and I and our teams are doing together. You look at the Phoenix ramp. We're excited about it. We're seeing that volume come in there and grow sequentially. It just gives our customers and BCOs more optionality.  Port of Houston is one. We put that service back on. We've been excited about the growth that we've seen come out of there, and we'll continue to add on to the destinations that are there. We started off with 5, now we're at 11. You look at Inland Empire, we just added on a new product there. Now we're going to 20 cities, east of Chicago with the CSX and the NS on the unit train side. Because we are seeing the cycle times improve, we're naturally getting more volume, so we like that piece. On the finished vehicle side, you talk about product development. business that's coming off of the water that's getting land bridge that we're moving back east. Look, this lower cost that we have really opens up new markets for us at great margins. So we're on offense. I mean we're pushing every lever we can to get business onto our network. We got a beautiful franchise, as Jim mentioned, and we're taking advantage of it. David Vernon : All right. If I could maybe squeak one quick follow-up. How is the FXE performing with the extra volume? I know south of the border, there's been a lot that shipped over onto that. And then, are you thinking about sort of expanding capacity over the Eagle Pass Gateway to maybe accommodate future growth out of Mexico? Vincenzo Vena : David, real quick, I've spent a lot of time, I think I've made like 8 or 9 trips down to Mexico already in the 8 months I've been here, working very closely with FXE with our ownership position in them. We know where the points of concern are. FXE has done a good job of identifying what they have to do, and I think they run a good service product. They're going to continue with the same goal as we have to strive, and we're working together on it. In fact, in a couple of weeks, I'm going to ride a train, head end of a freight train, down on the FXE to take a look at their railroad even more.  The border, we have processes in place to make it easier for our crews to not stop right at the border and get trains across, which just makes sense, just like between Canada and the U.S. at International Falls. So we are in the process of cleaning up those items that limit the speed and the efficiency for our customers to get across the border. So I'm very happy to see where we are. And we're trying to work as one railroad. I don't like to give other railroads my excess locomotives, and you can understand why, I don't have to explain it. But we have provided FXE some locomotives to make sure that they can move the traffic that's out there. And they've seen a large growth. Their number is -- I'll let them give you the exact number, but the -- we see growth in Mexico, both northbound and southbound, and that's a market we want to use those 6 touchpoints we have to get into Mexico and optimize it for Union Pacific. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Justin Long : So it was good to see the OR improve a little bit sequentially despite the typical seasonality that you see. And in the outlook, you talked about profitability gaining momentum. But can you help us translate that into how you're expecting the OR to trend over the balance of the year? It seems like we're tracking towards the sub-60 the rest of 2024, but is there anything on the horizon that could prevent that from happening? Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Justin. We are not providing OR guidance, but -- so I'm not going to comment on your number. But I think the way that you're describing it in terms of what we expect from ourselves is to continue to make improvement. You heard Jim talk about the fact that we made good gains, but there's more to do. And that's really our focus, is to continue to do that quarter-over-quarter to make gains. Obviously, we're doing that in an environment that we can't totally control.  We control a lot of things, especially about our service product and our cost structure and how we go into the market and how Kenny and his team are pricing, but we are doing that against an economic backdrop that's a little uncertain. We don't know what's going to happen with interest rates yet. So those are the things that do have an impact on us, including fuel prices. So just stay tuned. We feel really good about the setup and are very confident about our ability to perform. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Congrats on the strong results. Eric, obviously, you and the team have done a phenomenal job with the operations and the metrics. We've kind of been stuck in this 155,000-ish 7-day carload number. I will be curious to get your confidence and perspective on how much more you can handle when Kenny gives you that to handle. How you feel comfortable about moving 5,000, 10,000 more carloads per week, if you can talk about that? And then just, Jennifer, related to that this question that was just asked, the weather gets better from 1Q to 2Q, you move more industrial carloads. It's a pretty meaningful advantage as you move from 1Q to 2Q, if you can just talk about any. And fuel, I think fuel noise moderates a little bit. If you can just talk about anything that I'm missing there as we think about from 1Q to 2Q that might be on the negative side of the ledger. Eric Gehringer : Good. I'll start with it, Amit. Thank you very much for that question. Now I want to be really clear right off the bat. We have the capacity to be able to handle more than 155,000 carloads. What brings us tremendous confidence is when you think about the 5 critical resources that we have. We clearly have enough terminal capacity. We clearly have enough mainline capacity. More specifically, we've talked about in the past and continue to maintain a buffer in our crew base. We have a couple of hundred extra crews based across the system that are available. As to your point, when that volume comes on, we have the crews.  Locomotives, in my prepared comments, I said that over the last 12 months, we've been able to store 500 locomotives due largely because of the increased fluidity in the system. Those are available to us. As Kenny brings more volume to the railroad, we don't have to wait a week, we don't have to wait 30 days, they're parked across the system available to us. And then, of course, on the car side, we have cars not only spaced across the system that we call out the ready cars, but we actually have been working with customers in which we're storing cars right at their facility, so the moment they're ready to give us that load, we're ready to pick it up. Now when you think about capacity, the final thing you have to think about is the work that we do on train lengths. We talk often about driving volume variable approach to how we operate the railroad. Train length is one of the ways we do it. At a 300-foot improvement in our manifest quarter versus same quarter last year, that's a huge lift. That's a massive accomplishment by the team. Building train length in the manifest network is one of the hardest things we do. What that tells you is if we're really good at the hardest things we do, as the intermodal volume starts to come back, we don't have to add train pairs on. We can take some of the latent capacity we have in our existing train peers and utilize it. So we're ready. Vincenzo Vena : So, Amit, the only thing I would add is, and you know, I've never given guidance on operating ratio because it's a result of how you operate the railroad, and that's really important. But ex-fuel, a 60.1% last quarter with where the volumes were, what we did with price and what we did with efficiency on the railroad, that's a pretty good number. It's okay in the way I look at the world. Some people would say it's excellent. I go, it's pretty good. So I see moving us forward, and unless we get surprised, Kenny does his job properly, and we are able to return the proper price because of the great service and the product that we're delivering, and we continue to operate the railroad efficiently, and numbers underneath and the numbers that people don't see every day that I look at, make me very comfortable that we have a clear view of how we become more productive down at the ground level in this railroad driving decision-making closer to the people that need to make the decision and not trying to do it here in Omaha in like the headquarters.  So, Amit, I'm not going to give a number, but I'm comfortable with where we're headed in the long term for Union Pacific. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : Jim, I was going to ask just kind of where you left off. In January, you kind of admitted somewhat modestly that it would be difficult to improve the margin without a volume tailwind. And here you are with 200 basis points of core improvement with volumes down year-over-year. So what was the, I guess, change in the last couple of months? Eric touched on a lot of things, but how are you able to make such a huge improvement in such a short period of time? And what's your comfort in the sustainability of that when you actually do get a volume tailwind in the network? Vincenzo Vena : Well, let's start with the end of the question. I love volume, and I love revenue. So at the end of the day, that's really important to us to be able to drive it forward. And what we've done is we worked hard. It looks easy sometimes to operate a railroad and especially as complicated as the Union Pacific network is because it is complicated. It's not a linear railroad. It's very, very spread out in the way it operates. But I think we're focusing the people at the right level. We're doing the right things when it comes on the expense side and headcount and everything that's involved in it, making sure that we don't impact service. And I think we did a great job of it, and I can see us improve in every one of those.  So Kenny is going to deliver, Eric is going to deliver and the rest of us are going to make sure that we do everything we can possible to make sure that this company moves ahead because if we can have better margins, it opens up markets to us, even more markets than what we have today. So that is the end game, and you basically have asked me what our strategy is, and I'm looking forward to delivering it in the next couple of years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Congrats for the team on some great results in a tough volume environment. But I wanted to dig into, maybe flipping Amit's question a little bit on the other side. You've been focused on these operations for 8 months now. I want to understand the more room to run, right? So you're getting service to where you want, but -- maybe is there a continued ability to pull out locomotives and cars as you continue to get more efficient? Maybe just give kind of some examples of -- Eric talked about increasing train life. Isn't there ability to go further before the volumes come online? But just -- PSR typically is, you focus on improving the service and then you get the ability to pull out the equipment and employees as you move forward, so maybe just talk about the opportunity to keep doing that. Vincenzo Vena : Yes. Listen, great question. And I'm going to give Eric to talk about how he sees and what's moving forward and Kenny, but let me just summarize the way I like to look at things is you always try to optimize the network operationally and look for ways to be able to drive efficiencies in the network. But the base plan always is what did we sell to customers, what did we tell the customers we're going to deliver and make sure that that's the base plan. And from that, you build it up.  So we see improvements not only in train length -- we had a few more cars on every train, that's very efficient in the network. It allows us to have better capacity. But we also look at how we handle the terminals, touch points in the cars, how can we forward the cars without touching them for a longer distance.  And the next piece for us is how fast we can react to our train plan so that it takes us way too long right now and to be able to adjust our train plan so that we still provide the service that we sold. So we have tools in place, and we're developing them even further that allow us to change our plan in a much shorter period of time, in a few days or a week versus weeks so that we can optimize the railroad even more. So very excited about that, and I see that as being a positive step. Eric, Kenny, anything to add? Eric Gehringer : I'll start building up with that. So, Ken, to Jim's point, when you look at our quarterly performance from a dwell perspective, and we had a 5% improvement in our car dwell during the quarter, that's a full half of 1 hour off of every car on the Union Pacific. That's how we are able to move the cars faster. Now when you think about that going beyond that, to Jim's point about being agile, we took out 4,000 touchpoints just in the first quarter as we looked for more and more ways to be able to modify the transportation plan to move the cars faster.  Now you build off of that and you start to get to the fundamentals of the railroad, the improvements we've made in recrew rate. There's still opportunity there. Certainly, our investments in technology, both with [ RCO ] as well as [ Mobilinx ], that's about getting more productive in the yards. Even when we think about the brake-person deal that we signed last year that we spoke about working to ensure that we have capitalized on all those opportunities. We've talked about locomotives, 500 already out. We see more opportunities. You hit on train length to start your question, but also sometimes things we don't talk about, our purchase services, we made great progress, as Jennifer reported in the quarter on purchased services. We did that from everything from maximizing the material movement using trains instead of trucks to how many vehicles we have on the railroad. You've seen what our headcount has done over the last year. We've aligned our fleet from a vehicle perspective to that, to about 600 vehicles coming out. So everything is in play right now, Ken. We look at it every single day. We work through it every single day. And the biggest thing that we're looking for is how do we ensure that we make meaningful changes to not only improve our service product, but also make us safe while we drive financial success. Vincenzo Vena : Ken, anything to add? Kenny Rocker : I mean we talked about the efficiency. It shows up in the product development that we talked about. It shows up in all these small discrete things like adding more cars right at the customer's plant and asking for more business by customer, by plant. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : So the 3.5% price/mix number in 1Q, kind of how do you think about that over the course of the year? And obviously, puts and takes on the macro, truck pricing, et cetera, and some movements in the mix side as well. So how do we think the number evolves? Jennifer Hamann : So -- we're probably not going to give you a number, Ravi, which isn't going to surprise you, but I'll let Kenny talk to the markets. But just from a mix perspective, with intermodal probably staying weak through most of the year, that probably is going to give us the ability to have some positive mix within our business as we think about that for the rest of the year. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I've been very encouraged and proud of the commercial team and the conversations that they're having with customers on price, articulating the inflationary pressures that are there and working with those customers to price to the market, taking a little bit more risk to price that business. And at the end of the day, our service product has improved, as you can see in the results, and we're talking to our customers about that and aligning that with the capital investments we're making. So it is not a coincidence or by luck, we are having very deliberate conversations with our customers. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And if I can squeeze a super quick follow-up kind of, I think you had said in other revenue, there was a contract settlement and there's a claim settlement and other expenses as well. Is that the same one? Or Are they 2 different ones? Jennifer Hamann : Those are 2 different ones, Ravi. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Just wanted to kind of follow up on that last question from Ravi. In terms of just the mix, it sounds like it's getting better from here. Maybe, Kenny, you can give us some color in terms of the pace of renewals as it was always going to take a bit of time to touch through the rest of the business and services helping with that momentum. So it would be helpful to hear that. And then just secondarily, similarly on the labor agreements in coal, like are both of those with coal network rightsized to the big drop you've seen right now? Or is there a little bit more to do? And on the labor side, you obviously had some new agreements to adjust for as well. So just trying to figure out where those 3 things stand in terms of where they are now and sort of looking at the rest of the year. Kenny Rocker : Yes, I'll start off. Thanks for the question. I said that back in January, it's not like we woke up January 1 and started deciding that we needed to have these deliberate conversations with customers. These started well early last year. And we've shared this. We can touch close to half of our price annually. The other half is in multiyear deals. I touched on it a little bit, about the deliberate conversations that we're having, the risk that's out there. And then I'll talk about a couple of markets. You look at domestic intermodal, those spot markets, if you look at it, here where we stand today, they are the same that they were from a spot market perspective last year, so this has been a long time, same thing on the contracted rates. Those contract rates have been where they are for a long time, over 8 months. And so the good thing, if you're an optimist like I am, there -- you know you're at the trough, but the thing you don't know is when things will improve or get better. And we're not in a position where we're going to forecast that they -- when that will happen.  What I will tell you, and I talked about the product development already, we're prepared. We're ready. We're working with Eric's team, and we're bringing on more volume that comes on. And so we'll see what happens there, but I can tell you that we're prepared and excited. Eric Gehringer : And Brian, to your question about crews and the coal lines, so every single week, we review every board across the system. And we're looking, just as you pointed out, for changes in the market that shows up an increased or reduced demand. We've made adjustments. We'll continue to make adjustments. And it reminds me to make sure that we remind ourselves a year ago, we were talking to all of you about 200, 250 borrow-outs across the system. For the third month in a row, we have 0 borrow-outs across the entire system. Now that doesn't mean that with some seasonal adjustments to some business like grain harvest, we might put some out there, but it's a massive accomplishment, and I give the team credit for it because they've been able to manage the crews in a way that we don't have any borrow-out. So agility, all day long. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : You've alluded to this a few times this morning, but productive and cost takeout, certainly seem better than we would have had in our model, particularly in areas such as PT, which you have alluded to as well as the rents. Can you maybe talk to some of the sustainability of the current trend line? Because it was quite a bit of a delta versus what we've seen lately as we move forward from here. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Jordan, thanks for that question. So I think you're right. You're hearing a lot of positivity by the team because we know that there are more opportunities. And first, it's building the momentum, it's sustaining the momentum and then keeping the cost out. And so if you think about equipment rents, that really is all about continuing to drive the car velocity, continue to drive the cycle time and the dwell that Eric referenced. So those are directly impacting that line.  And then purchased services, certainly, the locomotive fleet is a big part of that, as we continue to use our locomotive fleet more protectively and reduce those numbers, that's an opportunity to sustain and potentially improve there as well as across the rest of the contract services that we use, is we're being smarter and looking deeper at every dollar that we're spending. And that's been one of Jim's messages to the team is, when you're looking at the resources, spend the dollars like your own and make sure that it's a wise dollar that's being spent and that you're getting the appropriate return for it. So feel good about continuing to make progress. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Eric Morgan : This is actually Eric Morgan on for Brandon. I just wanted to ask another one about mix. I appreciate the detail on the impact to yields, but I was just curious if you could speak to any effects on margins just because with coal being down, big drag on volumes right now in international intermodal as well. Should we be thinking these sort of mix swings helped to drive the strong OR in the quarter? Or is it really just an RPU impact? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. Thanks for that question. So mix does help on the RPU. And when we think about mix, there is some different mix in terms of the cost profile that's behind that. Our opportunity and our job is to improve the profitability of every line of business that we have. And so we are very proud of our manifest franchise. That's really our sweet spot for sure. But as Eric talked, intermodal, grain, coal, those are very profitable businesses for us as well to the extent that we can drive greater train length, So -- I'm not going to say we're totally agnostic, but we want to grow, and we want to grow across all lines of business. And so I think if you see us do that, you're going to like the margins that come from them. Vincenzo Vena : You bet. And just to sort of -- why don't I summarize the way I look at the quarter and what we see moving forward? First of all, if you look -- if you take a look at our results, our industrial, and that's what I love about Union Pacific is our industrial originations, the Mexico product that is non-intermodal, which gives us a different level of return and price capability, is strong. And that's what we want to see. And that was -- that's what helped us in the first quarter, and I can't see that changing, except I just don't know where the macro items are going to be in the short term in the U.S.  I was hoping with all the products that we ship and handle for people and consumers that I would have seen an interest rate cut in the next few months and maybe it will happen later on this year. So an interest rate cut would help us in what people are spending on their homes from lumber and number of products. But if you take a look at where we are, and that's what I like, we leverage that franchise we have in the Gulf in originations in the middle of the heartland of the United States.  And we always look for ways to improve our efficiency. We drive better return with whatever price we get out of the international and domestic business. And every time I see a train full of box cars and tank cars, it's music to my ears when those wheels roll by. So thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Kauffman : Congratulations, this quarter, a tremendous result. I wanted to take a step back, a question for Kenny. What are you seeing in terms of customer commitments to near-shoring or rebasing manufacturing? And then in terms of coming back to the rail, your service metrics are up. And clearly, there's a flywheel effect there, but what are your customers telling you they need to see, those that maybe took business away before they would bring that business back? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thanks for the question. On the near-shoring piece, it's real. You've seen the amount of investments that's there. We've got a strong commercial presence that's there, and you look at the overall rail, I'm talking the rail industry market share into and out of Mexico, is still relatively low if you put it in the mid-teens or so. Our new service product that we have in place at this time has been picking up steam and we've seen it grow. We've seen it grow in that North-South corridor. We've seen it grow in the traffic that we put on, the new product that we put on going in the Southeast, so tremendous growth there.  There is also a more carload business that will come online and more plants that will come online, some of them for some of the autos that are going to come on and some just other what I'll call just industrial pieces. We're set up for that. We're engaging those customers. Our network strength and franchise gives us an opportunity to move a lot of that, both the feedstocks in Mexico and the finished product out of Mexico, so a very strong place for us, the 6 gateways. We had a great quarter coming into and out of Mexico, and we want to build on that.  As far as those customers coming back to us, with every month that we are able to sustain and ensure reliable product, we're able to capture a little bit more business, but we're also able to sit down with them and talk to them about adding the 1 or 2 carloads or talk to them about a truck lane piece or talk to them about their rail versus truck by lane percentage. So the stronger service product is certainly a positive for us, and our commercial team has been very aggressive out there hustling to get every carload. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : Nice performance on the OR and the network and everything, so congratulations on that. I wanted to just get a little more color, I think, Jennifer or whoever else wants to jump in on the expense side, I know you've got a couple of questions, but comp and benefits, how do we think about that going forward? Is headcount stable? Did that go down a little bit? And then on the purchase services line, I know, kind of storing locomotives, cars, that's helpful, but is that -- should we model that kind of flat looking forward? Or I guess you said there's a onetime where you didn't identify whether that's kind of small or meaningful, so I think just from a modeling perspective. And -- is there kind of further improvement? Or how do we think about it sequentially on comp and benefits and purchase services? Jennifer Hamann : You bet, Tom. So let me start with the purchased services. So I think I did say that the one-time item there accounted for about half of the year-over-year decrease. So you should set that aside when you're thinking about rolling that forward. But again, as you heard me talk on another question, we still obviously think we have opportunities there.  If you switch to comp and benefits then, back in January, we said we thought that we would probably see about a 5% increase in that line for the year. We were at 4% here in the first quarter, so really kind of right online there. And I think you know the drivers, they're wage inflation, they're the sick pay benefits, some higher guarantee pay, offset by what we're doing to improve our overall productivity and how we're managing the headcount.  When you think about those new contract benefits in terms of the sick pay, it's also -- when we're rolling out the work rest agreements, that is resulting in a little bit of an elevation in terms of our TE&Y headcounts in anticipation of those benefits. And so really, the way to think about that is that we're paying a little bit more due to those agreements for the same unit of work. But I think what's encouraging there is we're offsetting that with some of our productivity, and that's our plan going forward. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. So that kind of comp and benefit plan probably is stable is the right way to look at it? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, obviously, if there's a significant change up or down from a volume perspective, that can have an impact, but I think we feel like we're in a pretty good place right now. Vincenzo Vena : It's a great way to look at it, Tom, in the short term, you'll see in the next few quarters. But the challenge, and one that we know that we have to tackle, is we have wage inflation. You deal with that absolutely, and you have a great service product and you price properly. I think we're doing the right things there so that we don't impact our customers to the point where they can't win in the marketplace.  But efficiency-wise, if you look at how the number of cars we're switching for employee and everything that we're doing with technology, I'm very comfortable that we'll figure out a way to change that slope on that line on what it costs us and the number of people per car to be able to hand the business level that we're at. So a little bit -- it's a lot of hard work, but I see over the next couple of years for us to get back in line to where we were. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : The owners of your Western competitor made some very public comments about really wanting more margin and profitability out of that business just a few months ago. Can you speak to if you've seen anything different in either how they approach the market or operate their business? And is or can that create opportunities for you to grow in the midterm? Vincenzo Vena : Bascome, it's a great question. And did I like to hear that? Absolutely. But because I think we're in an industry where we provide for the price that we charge very competitive and we beat most modes of transportation. So I think you need to be smart on how you price, and I think you need to make sure that we provide the service for that price that we sold. So we compete every day against our competitor, and we're here to win. And hopefully, they're prudent in the way they look at their markets, and I don't tell them what to do. They need to do theirs. And we're very comfortable that we're doing the right things. And I think head-to-head, we'll put our complex of what we have, including the Mexico piece, and I think it gives us a great opportunity to compete. And you have to love it, great competition against the great. The railroad is a wonderful thing. I love it. It makes us better. It makes the whole industry better. So I love the comments, but we'll see what their actions are as we see them go down the road. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So Jennifer, Kenny sounded a bit better on price. I know last quarter, you talked about price/cost is a margin headwind for the year. I'm just wondering, are we getting any closer to that becoming a tailwind, right, if we can combine some of the productivity stuff with price/cost that the margins could get pretty good. I just don't know if we're getting closer to that inflection yet. And then can you just clarify that if we've seen the full impact of the coal RPU headwind from lower nat gas, or if there's another step-down coming there? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I'll let Kenny talk -- take that coal question. But you're hearing it right. We're putting a lot of pressure on Kenny and the team to go out there and deliver the price, and they're very much stepping up to that and are taking on that challenge and being aggressive in the marketplace. Obviously, we improved our margins in the quarter. So the combination of our volume, which was down a little bit, but price and productivity is what's driving the margin improvement. I can't say that we're accretive yet from just a pure price inflation standpoint, but that absolutely is the goal. We are though exceeding, just the dollars are exceeding the inflation dollars. We're still very confident of that. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I just want to reiterate what Jennifer said, we'll exceed our inflationary dollars. On this coal question that you have, we're looking at the same things. You're looking at in terms of the natural gas futures, and we're talking to our customers, similar to my comments around domestic intermodal. Yes, I think we're at the trough levels, when they will come up is yet to be seen. They're still depressed. We'll see if we get some seasonal lift here going into the spring and the summer. I want a hot, muggy summer so we can move more business. But if that doesn't happen, we'll see what Eric and the team to do for us to efficiently move the coal business. Thank you for the question. Vincenzo Vena : I'm telling you, and I have to jump in on this one here, Kenny and team and everybody, coal is what it is, and I said it in my prepared comments on purpose. We have other markets that are going to take care of that coal business. It's tough to replace the number of the trains that we originate, but we used to originate a heck of a lot more than we do today, and we need to be able to grow it. So we can hope, and I'm not into hope. I'm into, let's go out there, deliver, have the right processes, have the right things possible, and we go deliver and we win.  And I've spoken about our franchise a few times on this call. That's what allows us to win. We provide good service and will more than offset anything that happens over the long term with coal. It is what it is, okay? I don't see it coming back to a large level that it will change us. It might do it for a short term, but that's the way I look at it, and that's the way the team here at Union Pacific is. We're going to win regardless of what happens to one commodity that we ship. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Stephanie Benjamin Moore : So, Jim, really nice progress here across safety and service. So in terms of customer engagement post these improvements, what are you hearing from customers? Are you seeing engagement accelerate at all? Kind of what's the opportunity from here? And then maybe on the flip side, I'd love to hear, have you noticed any challenges to the network, maybe revenue holds looking to fill that, that were maybe less apparent? I'd love to get your thoughts. Vincenzo Vena : It's a great question. I think it's -- when I came back to work, a lot of people thought that the only thing I'd concentrate is on operations, and I have been spending some time there. But I have spent a lot of time speaking to customers. I did it the first week I was on the job. I've followed up with them. I've gone to meetings when we bring them in, our Industrial, our Bulk, our Premium business. So the feedback is they want us to win, and they see themselves winning in the marketplace if Union Pacific can be successful in what our strategy is. So the feedback has been positive. There's always some markets and some customers that we have to truly understand what their impacts are and where they are because we want them to survive and win. So we're doing everything we can. And maybe, Kenny, you can speak a little bit more about our engagement and what we're doing with customers. Kenny Rocker : Yes. If you look at it, so far this year, our face-to-face meetings, the strong customer engagement strategies. We have a lot more, significantly more contacts with customers, and we're touching them in different ways. One of the unique strategies that we have as I'm looking at Eric, 1/3 of our meetings have an operating leader or a local operating person is there. And we're doing that to see how we can grow more business specifically. So strong customer engagement strategy at all levels, and we're going to keep at it. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Elliot Alper with TD Cowen. Elliot Alper : This is Elliot on for Jason Seidl. My question is on international intermodal. So the outlook calls for pretty muted international intermodal for the year, I guess. We would appreciate some more context around that. I mean, I understand there was a customer loss that you called out last quarter. We've seen some strong volumes coming out of the West Coast ports, I guess. Should we continue to think about that continued acceleration on the West Coast mostly offset? Or could there be some upside if the strength on the West Coast continues? Kenny Rocker : Elliot, thanks for the question. So a few things here. Let's set aside the contract loss you referenced. It's been strong. International intermodal has been strong for us, a little bit of a pleasant surprise for us that we've been able to capitalize on it. We're seeing more IPI business or business that's going into our network increase by a few points. We are aware that there has been a small impact on the positive side because of some of the challenges with the Panama Canal. We'll see what happens if some of the BCOs are a little bit more concerned with any labor issues on the East Coast.  But as we go through the second quarter, I feel pretty good about those volumes staying where they are, as we talk to our customers in their pipeline. I'd like to see as we move a few weeks out what happens in the second half of the year. So I'm not ready today here in April to bet on what's going to happen in the second half of the year. The last thing I'll end with, and I've said this quite a bit, I do like the fact that regardless of what happens at the West Coast, we're preparing for if it does get transloaded, more products were to get to the East Coast that I talked about, those 20 cities that will move with the NS and the CSX, our Phoenix product and us being holistically and leveraging the entire franchise to go after more business out of the Port of Houston. Thanks for your question. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So I want to take a little bit of a bigger picture on the competitive environment and how you interact with your competitors, both East and West. When we were at -- we were attending a recent session with the -- with Southern campaign, they called out the CP, KCS, CSX as a natural alliance. Just curious whether you see yourself as naturally being able to cooperate, coordinate operations to bring a more effective, higher service product to your customers. Is there one company in particular or -- that you could align a little bit closer with given the network interplay between the companies? Just curious what you're thinking about longer term in the absence of acquisitions or mergers. Could there be increased cooperation that allows you to bring a higher service to the customer? Vincenzo Vena : Walter, I appreciate the question. You have to think about it that 40% of the traffic that we either originate or receive starts somewhere else. So when you put that number in perspective, we can't be choosy and say that we'd rather partner with one Eastern railroad or one Canadian. I guess, I can't call CP or CN Canadian railroads anymore. I apologize to both of them, but international railroads. And what we need to do -- and all the short lines that we touch. The way I look at it is what is the best and the fastest and the quickest. So if we're all efficient, we all have good service, we all are smart in running a very fluid railroad that has buffer to be able to handle the ups and downs that naturally occur, Walter, we all win. So I don't have a preference. Now I love it that we get to compete with some of them, and we say, we originate lots of many cars, and we say to them, which one wants the business, is it CSX or NS or is it CN or CP. And I think we compete on some. But when we work together, which we are, we have very detailed meetings with CPKC, with CN, with NS and with CSX to talk about on that interline business, how do we make those interchanges fluid, so we don't spend 24 hours to interchange cars at some interchange when we go one way or the other. So we can win and beat trucks, especially in that speed network that requires that kind of work. So, Walter, no preference, best one wins, and we want to be able to tell people, you want to interchange with us because -- versus the other carrier in the West, the BNSF because we have the best model, we are the fastest, we can get the markets and we move quick. And once we get there, because the customer looks at it end-to-end, how good are you at origination, are you on time, how fast you get it over the road. And that's why I look at the -- I don't look at train speed, it's an illogical measure on productivity on the railroad. I look at car velocity, and that's what's important. So hopefully, I answered your question, Walter. Walter Spracklin : It does. Congrats on a great quarter. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel. Benjamin Nolan : And as much as we, you guys don't want to talk about specific markets. One of the things that I've been hearing about lately a lot is more crude by rail. Kenny, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that. Is that something that you guys are seeing? And as you think about sort of the outlook going forward, how needle moving is that to the business? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thanks for the question. You heard my comments around our petroleum markets and business development wins there. And it's a type of oil that we're moving that we're excited about, and it's moving right now domestically. We've seen some strength. Eric's team has been able to help us grow a little bit of that business and get as much of it as we can. So we don't see that kind of traditional crude by rail that we saw 10 years ago, but we're seeing another emerging commodity in the market that we're excited to be moving, and it's going great for us. Vincenzo Vena : Rob, just let me -- if that was the last question, let me just summarize real quick because I think there's a few key points that I want to make sure that we highlight. One is, I think, the last 2 quarters have shown what's possible for this railroad. And that's really important to us is what's possible. We will have headwinds. We have a wage increase coming July 1. That's a headwind.  We have certain segments of our business that are down and can be up and others that are up that are going to impact us. But the way we look at it, and I'm so proud of this entire team and the entire railroad, if you look at what we're doing is we're making ourselves more efficient, we're driving decision-making to the right level, we're providing service that we sold our customers at a high level. And the franchise that we have and the network that we have gives us every possibility to win in the long term. That's the goal.  I'm looking forward to in September deep diving what we look like in the next 2 or 3 years, have a longer-term plan for everybody. And I'm sure I'm going to run into some of you before. But, otherwise, looking forward to the next quarter that closes. April is a great start with where our carloads are, and this is a great railroad, great franchise, and I'm looking forward to moving it forward.  Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin. Jim Vena : Thanks, Rob. And, good morning, and nice to come to you all from a beautiful morning here is Omaha. And, thanks for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific\u2019s second quarter results. I\u2019m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As we dive into the discussion of the second quarter, you\u2019ll hear that operating outdoors these past few months has not been easy, but I\u2019m pleased with how we manage those challenges to drive strong financial results. It provides another proof point that our strategy is the right one to drive success. Now, let\u2019s discuss second quarter results starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 second quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.74 per share. This compares to 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Second quarter operating revenue was up 1% as solid core pricing gains and slightly increased volume were reduced by a negative business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. And, if you\u2019re normalizing for the yearly change in fuel, freight revenue was up 2% versus 2023. Reported expenses year-over-year were down 4%. This is very impressive work by the team to offset the high inflationary pressure we\u2019ve experienced in a flattish volume environment, even when you adjust for one-time items and fuel. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.0% improved 300 basis points versus last year and despite some challenges, we still showed sequential improvement. Overall, this quarter was another solid step toward our goal of leading the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. I\u2019ll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to Q&A. So, we\u2019ll start with Jennifer and the Q2 financials. Jennifer? Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 5 with a walk-down of our second quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6 billion increased 1% versus last year on slightly positive volume. As Kenny will highlight, this strong topline performance was supported by solid pricing gains and business wins against the backdrop of weak coal demand. Second quarter freight revenue totaled $5.6 billion, a 1% gain. Digging into the revenue components, strong core pricing gains partially offset by an unfavorable business mix added 150 basis points to freight revenue. Double-digit growth in international intermodal volume was the primary contributor to the negative mix dynamic and further compounded by an overall decline in our higher average revenue per car industrial business. Slightly positive volumes in the quarter added 50 basis points to freight revenue. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $669 million declined 5% as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 2% as the team continues to pace revenue growth faster than volume. Wrapping up the topline, other revenue declined 6% as a result of lower intermodal accessorials and less demand for auto parts shipments at our Loup subsidiary. Switching to expenses, second quarter operating expense of $3.6 billion decreased $152 million versus 2023 as we drove productivity across most cost categories. We have more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers. Compensation and benefits expense declined 6% versus last year as we reduced headcount 5% and generated positive productivity. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced compared to 2023, train service employees increased 1% as we continue to carry more train service employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of new labor agreements. The remainder of the workforce decreased 9% as we continue to focus on delayering and pushing work down in the organization. And, as you\u2019ll recall, last year\u2019s expenses included a $67 million one-time ratification payment. Following up on an item we highlighted at our first quarter report, last month we completed the transfer of around 350 mechanical employees to Metro in Chicago. Going forward, this transfer will lower both other revenue and our expenses by roughly $15 million a quarter. Excluding last year\u2019s one-time labor payment, cost per employee in the second quarter increased 4% as we continue to drive for better overall efficiency. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 6% on a 5% decrease in fuel prices from $2.86 per gallon to $2.73 per gallon. We overcame a challenging operating environment and less fuel efficient freight mix to improve our fuel consumption rate 1% largely by locomotive productivity. Equipment and other rents declined 12%, reflecting improved cycle times and lower lease expense, partially offset by business mix. Finally, other expense decreased 4% as we recorded a couple of one-time items in the quarter. On the positive side, we added a $46 million gain from an intermodal equipment sale. Conversely, we recognized $23 million of additional environmental expense at a legacy California remediation site. Second quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 9% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased 11% as a result of interest received on tax refund claims, while interest expense declined 6% on lower average debt levels. Second quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.74 both improved 7% versus 2023. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60% improved 300 basis points year-over-year. As I just discussed, there were several puts and takes in the quarter. Key here is that our core operations drove 160 basis points of OR improvement and $0.21 of EPS growth year-over-year. This is a great continuation of the momentum we\u2019ve created these past three quarters. Turning to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 6, second quarter cash from operations totaled $4 billion up $175 million versus last year. Growth in operating income and 2023 labor agreement payments partially offset by higher income tax payments resulted in the increase in cash from operations and our free cash flow improvement, up 43% to $853 million. As stated back in April, we restarted share repurchases late in the second quarter. Although we plan to ramp up repurchases through the year, we started slowly with just over $100 million repurchased in June. Combined with our dividend payments, we\u2019ve returned $1.7 billion to shareholders year-to-date. Finally, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.8 times and we continue to be A rated by our three credit rating agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 7, as we\u2019ve reached the midway point of 2024, there remains some uncertainty about the second half recovery that many were forecasting. As Kenny will detail, there are definitely markets where we\u2019re seeing growth and much of that growth is being driven by our business development efforts. There also are some challenge markets, particularly coal. Operationally, the team is making great progress towards our long-term goals to be the best in safety, service and operational excellence. This is reflected in the progress in our safety and performance metrics, including our margins. Importantly, we believe the trend is indicative of where we can get to long-term and each successive quarter is a step on our way to winning. We are highly confident in our ability to generate price dollars in excess of inflation dollars and still expect freight revenue to pace ahead of volume in 2024. We also remain committed to our long-term capital allocation strategy. This includes last week\u2019s announcement of a 3% increase in our dividend as we drive higher returns to our owners. This increase represents the 18th year in a row of annual dividend increases. With share repurchases, we expect to repurchase around $1.5 billion in 2024 as we maintain our current leverage. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I\u2019d summarize our second quarter financial performance as strong and our confidence in the future stronger as we continue to unlock the potential of our great franchise. We\u2019re excited to execute on our strategy in the second half and lay out more of our long-term thoughts at our Investor Day in September. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid second quarter, especially if you put aside the lower volume from coal. Freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was up 2% excluding fuel surcharges due to strong core pricing and a slight increase in volume. Let\u2019s jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was down 2% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car driven by solid core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. However, if you exclude coal, Bulk revenue for the quarter was up 4% year-over-year and volume grew by 6%. Coal volume was down 23% in the quarter due to ongoing secular decline of the market along with continued challenges from lower natural gas prices and higher inventory levels. Fertilizer volumes increased for the quarter due to strong export demand for Canpotex potash and easier comps from a 2023 customer outage. In addition, grain products business was favorable due to increased demand for renewable diesel, strong demand for ethanol and new business wins. Moving to Industrial, revenue was up 2% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on opportunities. Petrochemicals volume continued to grow due to improved domestic demand in plastics and strong business development wins in our industrial chemicals markets from customers located along the Gulf Coast. However, challenges with high inventories and rainy weather in the South negatively impacted our rock volumes. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 4% on a 6% increase in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car reflecting negative mix, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressure. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, but offset by unplanned decreases in production impacting auto parts shipments. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong due to West Coast import demand and positive domestic growth despite market conditions especially within our Parcels segment. Now, turning to Slide 10. Here\u2019s our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, coal is expected to remain challenged as inventories remain high and natural gas futures stay at levels that make coal less competitive. For grain, as we sit here today, the markets look stable and healthy although global export sales are off to a slow start. Crop conditions look good and we\u2019ll have a better read over the next several weeks. In addition, we expect grain products to remain positive as we see incremental renewable diesel production coming online in California and continue to capture new business. Turning to Industrial. Our outlook remains the same as we laid out during our last earnings call. We expect our rock market will not match last year\u2019s record volume. However, both petroleum and petrochemical markets will remain favorable due to our focus on business development supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast. And, wrapping up with Premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see continued strength for imports in the near-term. And, while we have seen imports drive pockets of increased demand, on the domestic side, the overall market remains soft. But, our improved service product, along with our diversified set of private asset owners and IMCs provide Union Pacific more at bet when opportunities present themselves. And for automotive, we\u2019re still expecting year-over-year growth due to business development wins despite some softening in the market. In summary, I\u2019m proud of the commercial team and their focus to fill the volume gap we\u2019re seeing from coal. On the price side, we\u2019re achieving solid price results to overcome inflation and delivering the consistent and efficient service that we sold to our customers. As we head into the second half of the year, I am confident that our great franchise, along with the diverse product offerings we provide, gives our customers the ability to compete and win in the marketplace. Our commercial leaders are actively working with customers and the operating team to convert more over the road business to rail that allows us both to win and grow. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric, to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As you heard from Jim, Mother Nature delivered many powerful weather events throughout the quarter as we experienced impactful flooding across both our northern and southern regions. But, we\u2019re not here to make excuses. Leveraging our intense focus on operational excellence and detailed contingency plans the team quickly acted to mitigate the impact by adjusting trip plans and deploying temporary buffer resources to safely restore operations. I\u2019m very proud of our frontline employees who worked tirelessly to repair our infrastructure to minimize the customer impact. There are countless examples highlighting their efforts as they repaired miles of damaged track, restored bridges and cleared countless trees and debris. That being said, versus 2023, service levels and network performance for the second quarter remained strong, demonstrating our recoverability in the wake of major weather disruptions. Starting with our foundation of safety, we continue to drive improvements building on the momentum of the first quarter. For the second quarter, both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While I am proud of the team for making this progress, we will not rest until every employee goes home safe to their loved ones every day. Freight car velocity was flat in the second quarter compared to 2023 as improvements in terminal dwell were offset by weather impacted train speeds. The opportunity here is to drive even stronger terminal dwell performance by removing unnecessary car touches across the network. On the service front, intermodal SPI improved four points as manifest and auto SPI remained flat. Although we worked hard to minimize impact on weather on our service product, we know customers felt the impact, particularly those located in the affected areas. Now, let\u2019s review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. The team remains highly focused on cost control, leveraging technology and other investments to drive productivity throughout our operation. As I mentioned last quarter, it is imperative to our strategy as it enables Kenny and the team to compete in the marketplace. Similar to the first quarter, we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 6% compared to second quarter 2023 driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization. Throughout the year, we have been able to efficiently flex our locomotive fleet with units readily available to adjust to varying volume levels. Workforce productivity, which does include all employees, improved 5% versus 2023. While overall employee levels decreased, our active train, engine and yard employees increased as we implement new labor agreements. Train length improved 2% compared to second quarter 2023 and 3% sequentially due to increased intermodal volume combined with the usage of safety technologies like Precision Train Builder. In fact, our second quarter result was a quarterly record and June marked the first month ever with train length over 9,600 feet. This is a remarkable achievement by the team as they continue to generate mainline capacity for future growth. Wrapping up, it\u2019s important to note, as we continue to implement new technology throughout our operation, we are also building new processes. These processes powered by automation and real-time analytics open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing such examples at our Investor Day in September. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to, Jim. Jim Vena : Thank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I\u2019d like to quickly summarize what you\u2019ve heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, despite a challenging environment, we achieved strong financial results in the quarter. We continue to drive efficiency into the network and the commercial team has done a good job generating price for the value we provide our customers. Kenny provided you with an overview of the second quarter volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the remainder of the year. I think it\u2019s worth stating that when you remove coal, our total volume was up 3% in the second quarter. This demonstrates that even in a tough freight environment, we are winning with our customers to bring new business to the railroad. Lastly, Eric walked you through the progress we\u2019re making across safety, service and operational excellence. In the first half of the year, our safety metrics improved, but we still have a way to go. Our service was challenged in the quarter, but I\u2019m pleased with our ability to recover and we\u2019re continuing to do things more efficiently making good improvements in operational excellence. Look the quarter presented its challenges, but I\u2019m very pleased with the results we achieved. From the beginning, I said improvement wasn\u2019t going to be a straight line. There are just too many variables when you operate an outdoor factory, but I expect the trend line will be in the right direction and we demonstrated that again this quarter. Over the past 12 months, we\u2019ve put this company on the right path to redefining what\u2019s possible for Union Pacific, a theme we\u2019ll build on at our Investor Day in mid-September. With that, now we\u2019re ready to take your questions, Rob. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And, the first question today is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So, Jim, if I recall, it was almost a year ago that you got appointed CEO and I think you said publicly like give me a year then let\u2019s look back and judge how things went. I think you just clearly articulated the coal headwinds in the quarter. But I guess, how would you look at the past year in terms of operational improvement, network performance? And then maybe most importantly customer growth, which I think you were alluding to? Jim Vena : Yes, Brandon, I appreciate the question and you\u2019re right on. I think they announced me last year on 26th, we agreed that I was going to join this company and the announcement came up. So, guess what it\u2019s a year. Now, I actually didn\u2019t start work till the 14th of August, but that\u2019s okay, couple of weeks doesn\u2019t make a difference. Bottom line is, if I look at the quarter Brandon, I\u2019m very, very, very happy with how we\u2019ve progressed on this railroad. If you start above the line and Kenny and the entire team have done a great job of, we knew we had an inflationary pressures with the contracts that were signed and we knew that we had to do something above the line and I think we\u2019ve done a great job and you can see that where the revenue comes in against our volume growth and we continue and we will continue to see that as we go through the year. So, I\u2019m very comfortable with that. Business development, we have been, I have personally spent a lot of time, Kenny and his entire team spends a lot of time and the entire leadership group with customers looking for opportunity and we\u2019ve spent capital and developed new facilities and expanded facilities across our network to be able to handle more business. But, the best part about it is our service level is to the point where the first discussion isn\u2019t, are you providing the service that we agreed to, it\u2019s more of how do we work together to move ahead. Operationally below the line very comfortable to be able to present today the numbers that we are on car velocity, dwell, locomotive and things that you all don\u2019t see, how fast our crew changes are, how well we\u2019re able to and the number of people it takes to operate the terminals, we see those numbers every day and I\u2019m very comfortable of where we are. And, I\u2019m also very happy that we continue to improve our operating ratio and I don\u2019t see that stopping. We\u2019ll have, I never give a number for operating ratio, because it\u2019s a result of everything you do, but to have a 160 basis points improvement this last quarter, year-over-year operating ratio and sequentially a small is a greater testament with what we can do with everything that we were impacted with this customer. We are not a team that makes excuses. You won\u2019t hear us complain about coal. We just say that coal is a problem, but to be able to when we had 20% plus drop in our coal volume to actually increase goes to show you the strength of our network. We\u2019re going to leverage what we\u2019re doing in Mexico with our 26% ownership of the FXE and we think that\u2019s going to lead to more growth as we move ahead and we\u2019re going to leverage this network we have. So, Brandon, I\u2019m in a real good place. So, hopefully you guys aren\u2019t the toughest marketers in the world, because sometimes some of you are. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with where we are today and I look forward to how this next few years while I\u2019m leading this company and show everybody what we can do. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate the answer, Jim. Thanks. Jim Vena : You\u2019re welcome, Brandon. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, I know, Jennifer, mix can swing on you positive negative. Any thoughts on mix based on your volume outlook in the back half of the year? And then, I just want to bigger picture, right? Even if I adjust for mix, the yield growth is still relatively muted in the context of higher inflation. And so, I know I\u2019ve asked this before, I keep asking because I just think it\u2019s so critical like when do you guys think we truly get back to inflation plus pricing? And, I don\u2019t mean like dollars versus dollars, I mean like margin accretive inflation plus pricing because I think that\u2019s sort of like the, in my opinion, the key to like having confidence in like sustained margin improvement. So, I don\u2019t know, any thoughts? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Well, so a couple of things there, Scott. On the mix side of things, as we look ahead, a lot of the drivers that were present in our volumes here in the second quarter are going to be present at least into the third quarter. International intermodal is staying strong, coal is weaker, the industrial portion of our portfolio, while we\u2019ve got great business development opportunities, there\u2019s just a little softness there. And so, if you assume that, that dynamic continues, that\u2019s going to continue to have an impact on our mix, probably to the negative side. So, I mean, you guys get our volumes every week, you\u2019ll be able to see that, engage that, but that\u2019s kind of our going in expectation as we look at what\u2019s ahead of us, particularly into the third quarter and we\u2019ll see how some of those intermodal trends move into 4Q. In terms of the question relative to price and price accretion, the team is doing, I think, a very good job of driving price in the areas where they can touch it and actively work with the customers. Jim mentioned the service aspect of it, that\u2019s critical when you\u2019re sitting in front of customers and driving the price. And so, the thing that I\u2019m very encouraged by is we know we\u2019ll get to that point. I\u2019m not going to give you a date by which we\u2019ll get to that point. But, what\u2019s encouraging is without that, we\u2019re still driving very solid margin improvement and looking for more going ahead. So, that\u2019s what I would focus on. And, as we continue to get more access to contracts, that\u2019s just going to give us more upside and more ability going forward. Scott Group : Thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question, Scott. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Jim and team, good morning. Nice to see you guys recover from some of the weather in the quarter. I want to focus in a little bit on something, Kenny, that you say, you mentioned there was some weakness on your rock business. We\u2019ve been hearing some of the infrastructure projects that were planned are sort of really not getting off the ground. Is that part of the weakness that\u2019s behind that or what are you looking at in the marketplace? Kenny Rocker : Yes, Jason, you\u2019re right, on. We\u2019ve seen some NLG products down in the Gulf that have been delayed or slow roll. And, a lot of it also is just overall demand and we haven\u2019t had the best weather, haven\u2019t seen that in that second quarter. So yes, it is. I will tell you this though, Jason, Eric\u2019s team is doing everything they can to capture the volume that is out there. We\u2019re looking at adding every car to every train that we can to maximize efficiency. So, as the opportunities are there we\u2019re taking advantage of it. Jason Seidl : Well, that makes sense. And, Kenny, on the delayed projects, is there any expectation for these things to sort of be lifted as we look into \u201825 or it\u2019s just sort of a wait and see? Kenny Rocker : I think, it\u2019s wait and see. It\u2019s hard for us to go out and forecast what a lot of the customers will do and how the contractors will play out. Our best bet is just to be prepared, which we are. Jason Seidl : Sounds good. Appreciate the time. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, do we get to a point in your new tenure here where some of these productivity improvements that you\u2019ve made start to hit a ceiling without volume? And, clearly what you\u2019ve been able to do on locomotives and workforce, in a flat volume environment and of course we understand what\u2019s happening with coal, is pretty impressive, but do you hit the ceiling without a volume tailwind at some point? Jim Vena : No, I don\u2019t see that. I think we\u2019ve shown that we can improve and I see more improvement even with a flat. I don\u2019t expect us to have our volume be flat though. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019re working at this. Everything that we\u2019ve done is to increase our volume against some pretty big negatives that are structural that we can\u2019t control. So, is it easier when you have increase in volume? Yes, you have another five cars on an intermodal train or a manifest train makes it a lot easier. But, the technology that we\u2019re implementing, the speed that we\u2019re going to be able to change our plan and what we\u2019re doing moving forward will help us to be able to even on a flat volume be able to improve our efficiency. So, I\u2019m very comfortable with, as we move ahead there\u2019ll be more even on a flat. Jon Chappell : Great. Thanks, Jim. Jim Vena : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Jim Vena : Good morning. Stephanie Moore : I think continuing on the prior question, really nice margin performance for the first half of the year. Can you talk a little bit, just based on maybe some of the mix headwinds and the cost of initiatives and a lot of the kind of puts and takes here, what that should mean in terms of kind of normal seasonality for margins as the OR as the year progresses? Thank you. Jim Vena : Stephanie, listen, I just sort of answered overall on the high level what I see, but I\u2019m going to pass this off to, Kenny. Kenny, you talked about margin, how we\u2019re looking at pricing, how we move ahead. Kenny Rocker : Yes, yes. Thanks for that, Jim. So, first of all, you all have heard me say that before, when you look at our approach to revenue growth, it\u2019s volume growth through business development, but it\u2019s also our pricing approach. And, our commercial team has been very clear to articulate some of the inflationary pressures that are out there. But more importantly, the team has taken risks. And so, we are doing as these contracts are coming up everything we can do to maximize price or margin expansion. And so at every turn, at every contract, those are some with our service improving, Eric, those are some really good opportunities for us to maximize our price. So, we\u2019re doing everything we can do there. Stephanie Moore : So, I guess just a follow-up, really nothing from a seasonality standpoint to really call out as we think about performance as the year progresses? Jennifer Hamann : I mean, when you think about seasonality, I\u2019ll jump in here. It really has a lot to do with volumes. And, if you look at our volume performance, generally speaking, the quarters where we have the strongest volume growth, that\u2019s where you tend to get your greatest margin improvement. It goes back to Jim\u2019s comments on productivity and that volume leverage piece. That said, we\u2019ve shown really good sequential improvement in our margins and have kind of broke that trend as we\u2019ve really come in and put a big focus on how we can drive greater productivity across the network over the last three quarters. And quite frankly, I think that\u2019s something that maybe is a little bit underappreciated in terms of how hard it has been for the team to achieve that. Looking forward, it really is going to be about the volumes and the continued emphasis on the productivity and the price. Those are our three levers. And so, as you\u2019re thinking sequentially, I\u2019d be comparing volumes sequentially and see how that progresses. That\u2019s going to really be the determinant. Jim Vena : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, maybe a couple for, Kenny. Can you just talk about the international intermodal has always been quite strong. There\u2019s been some expectation for that to spill over into domestic. Do you have any thoughts on when that might happen and whether that\u2019s good, bad or indifferent for UP? And then secondly, I don\u2019t know who would want to take this, but just as we get to the Investor Day in a couple of months, you talked about redefining what\u2019s possible. Can you help level set expectations what we\u2019re going to hear from you all and the team? Will we see multi-year growth strategy, again underpinned by some of the end markets, we talk about truckload conversion and quantify that, maybe just help give us some expectations on what to think about in a couple of months when we see you on Dallas? Kenny Rocker : Yes, let me take this, the first one on international intermodal. So first of all, yes, we\u2019ve seen some very strong growth on the international intermodal side and yes, we have seen some of that spillover on the domestic intermodal side. And, I want to touch on the fact that our product development, meaning the investment that we\u2019ve made efficient investments in places like Inland Empire helping us to grow. Here recently, even though it\u2019s a short-term phenomenon because of the labor issues up in Canada. We\u2019re not going to just take that volume in the short-term. We\u2019re doing everything we can to get it permanently. We won a piece of business into our Twin Cities Inland Intermodal Terminal and that\u2019s the way we can take advantage again of the product development that\u2019s out there. So, that\u2019s the international intermodal. I talked a little bit about the fact that yes, we are seeing quite a bit that\u2019s being transloaded that\u2019s showing up on the domestic side and our products are helping grow. In fact, when we look at our domestic business, year-over-year in the quarter it was up and we feel pretty good about where it started off here in this quarter. So, that\u2019s some real specific feedback for you. Jennifer Hamann : Okay. And, then in terms of your question about the Investor Day and what\u2019s possible, that really is going to be how we\u2019re going to frame things and that\u2019s certainly been Jim\u2019s challenge to the team since he came here a little over a year ago, is don\u2019t look back at what you\u2019ve done historically, don\u2019t look back and see what you think has been best ever, look forward and see what you really do think we can achieve together with this great franchise that we have. So, I don\u2019t want to front run things too much with you, Brian. We want to make sure folks tune in September. But, we\u2019re excited about the message and the opportunity to speak to everybody and share some of our plans. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, understood. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Good morning. So, service was challenged by the weather in the quarter. You\u2019re showing an ability to recover. Jim, you just noted we should continue to see operating ratio improvement going forward. Should we see that improved car velocity going forward now you don\u2019t have storms and being the cost benefit then I guess I\u2019ll ask kind of Stephanie\u2019s question a little differently. Given the hazy economic outlook, can operating ratio improve sequentially? Jim Vena : Well, Ken, people always want me to start talking about where we I think the endpoint is on this and I think we continue to improve. We\u2019re going to have quarters that are better than other quarters, but operationally you should always look at, we give a lot of metrics out there and if you take a look at the metrics, car velocity is real important, dwell time is real important and then of course there\u2019s about 100 others that I look at internally that tell me how we\u2019re operating and where we need to focus and how we need to do this. So, that\u2019s one piece and we are aligned. We\u2019ve got a great team. They know what the end goal is. So, I see us optimizing the railroad and continue to get better at how we operate. But, what really helps operating ratio and margins is revenue growth, and we are pushing hard on that piece by both bringing in volume at the right price and also pricing because of inflation and everything we\u2019ve had. So, when you put those two things together, we might have some quarters where sequentially it doesn\u2019t improve as much as people would like because it\u2019s never a straight line. But, I\u2019m very comfortable. I didn\u2019t come back to work. I look at it as I had a sabbatical for a couple of years away from Union Pacific, came on, did what we had to do operationally. I\u2019m back here to drive this place to where is what I see is possible, and I\u2019m very comfortable. And, after the first year, I\u2019m even more comfortable than I was on August 14 when I walked back in the front door. So Ken, it\u2019s take a look at those metrics, but take a look at what\u2019s happening in our volume and translate that on what we did in the second quarter on revenue against where we were with our carload growth. So, hopefully that gives you a better framing of the way I look at it, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Jim. Jim Vena : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. Jim Vena : Good morning. Tom Wadewitz : So, I wanted to ask just on kind of I think you talked about some weakness in industrial. How do you think about your markets overall if you say industrial and consumer? Are things getting kind of a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker in those two segments? And then, maybe one more for probably for Kenny as well, you mentioned a lot of times business development and new customer wins, which is great. Wondered if you could kind of give us a couple of buckets to think about where the opportunity for new business wins is the most significant, right? Are there some industrial segments or which customer segments give you the most opportunity in the future for those customer wins to matter? Thank you. Kenny Rocker : Yes. Thank you, Tom. So, you\u2019ve got a few macroeconomic indicators like, industrial production, not strong, housing starts aren\u2019t helping us either and then you know where natural gas prices are. So, we don\u2019t get the rollover and play dead, because coal is not where it needs to be. The commercial team is out there hustling and getting more business. Let me talk about some of the areas that I feel good about from a business development perspective. Renewable diesel, I\u2019ll start with that. That\u2019s an emerging market. I\u2019ve been really excited that the team has been out there growing origin points and destination points. It allows us to pitch and catch. On the petrochemical side in the Gulf, we talked about the investments there and the wins that we\u2019ve been able to get in that petrochemical market. And then, on the Premium side, I\u2019ll talk about it from a couple of angles. One is Mexico will continue to be a market over the near-term and long-term. And, you\u2019ve seen that Eric side has put up some really good products up against it as we talk about that north south quarter getting into the Midwest and products in terms of getting into the Southeast and then bought quite a few new products coming out of Houston, going into Phoenix, setting up our ramp and expanding in different areas. So, in some cases, we have to create our own markets to make the pie larger and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re seeing. Tom Wadewitz : When you say the premium side, you mean premium like domestic and removal products? Or how do you mean that? Kenny Rocker : Both domestic and our international intermodal. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. And just back on the kind of economy question, do you think it\u2019s getting like stronger or weaker or is that hard to say? Kenny Rocker : It\u2019s still very unclear for us. I\u2019m not in a position to forecast where it is. All I\u2019m telling you is that we\u2019re going to go out and make our own markets where we can and we\u2019re doing that through the product development that I mentioned and working with customers. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Jim Vena : Thanks, Tom. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Kenny coming back on the pricing side, I guess I\u2019m just kind of curious as you\u2019re seeing the market from a volume perspective ex-coal look a little bit more supportive here in \u201824, operationally things are moving well. As you\u2019re having these incremental contract renewals, is it reasonable to say that the rate of increase is beginning to maybe pick up a little bit? I guess I just was curious kind of perspective when you\u2019re thinking in the old days when we used to get sort of same store sales type of numbers, how you think about that? So, I was just kind of curious if we are actually starting to see any uptick there? Kenny Rocker : The short answer is yes. The long answer is that every contract is unique, every customer is unique, every discussion is unique. We\u2019re mixing that with what\u2019s happening on the service side. A stronger service product is helping us. We\u2019ve always been very price disciplined as a company. What you\u2019re seeing is that now we\u2019re able to take a little bit more risk as we\u2019re talking to our customers because of the inflationary pressures that are out there. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, operator. So, Jim, you mentioned before your sabbatical there, you were able to achieve an operating ratio as low I think in one quarter it\u2019s 55.1%. And there\u2019s been a lot of talk in about how this time is different and that might not be an achievable number. So, not asking you a target, just rather asking you, are things different -- are there factors that are really limiting you that weren\u2019t there before either cyclical like volume or structural like the work rules? Just trying to get an apples-to-apples compare of what kind of what is the new 55%, not asking you that, but more asking you are there those factors are they meaningful enough to kind of put it in permanent impairment on that on an objective or any comparing it to any prior level of operating ratio achievement? Jim Vena : Walter, I like the question because that\u2019s exactly the way we need to look at it is, we know what we\u2019ve done before and I could go back to when I was at Canadian National and numbers that were delivered back in 2013 to 2016. So, I know the game of how and the play and how you have to get there to be able to deliver. Is there some things that are structurally different? Yes, the collective agreements are impact to our cost and will follow for a while with us. Now we\u2019ve done a great job of mitigating some of it, but it\u2019s pretty tough to mitigate it all. So, that\u2019s a negative that\u2019s going to be with us for a while. So, we\u2019ll probably carry a few more people than we normally would have if the railroad had not signed some of the last collective agreements. But I look at it this way, I see a clear picture as we move ahead that we can mitigate a lot of that and have a railroad that\u2019s very efficient. We\u2019re going to use the network we have to optimize our cost structure. We are implementing work patterns and how we operate that will help us. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to mitigate all of that, but you can also mitigate it by bringing more business on and also leveraging our access to Mexico, leveraging our access to customers. Kenny is a little reserved sometimes in Jennifer, but I\u2019ll tell you, we have a railroad that the opportunity is there. And we have discussions, we don\u2019t talk about, oh geez, we have some problems with this. We look at what are we going to do, Phoenix, we opened it up because we think there\u2019s a market there. Minneapolis, we opened it up. Fritz Intermodal Terminal, we expanded. We spent money in the Gulf and working with customers that want to be with us. So, we do both of those. I say, hang on, watch us go. This is not a short-term. I said it the very first time I was on the call, this is not a short-term fix when you have that kind of inflationary pressure. But I\u2019m very happy that this quarter we were able to deliver another 160 basis points of improvement in our OR with everything that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019re going to have some good quarters, some bad quarters, but I\u2019m telling you in the long run stay tuned Walter. And listen Walter, I\u2019ve seen as you\u2019re you\u2019re probably in Canada, I know there\u2019s a lot of people that I know from CN and others impacted with fire in my hometown and I wish everybody the best. Walter Spracklin : Appreciate it. Okay, thanks for the color, Jim. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yes, thanks. I was interested to see that the average train length, I think you\u2019d said, was the highest that it\u2019s ever been. It was curious if, as you think about that going forward, maybe there were some puts and takes, like more international intermodal, I assume is helpful to that, but maybe coal is detrimental. Do you think there\u2019s more room to go there? Can we continue to see, the train lengths improve? And then, obviously, that is beneficial to everything across the board, but OR in particular. Jim Vena : Well, let me pass it over to Eric and I can\u2019t give you the answer, because Eric knows it\u2019s a different number than that, but I\u2019ve got a goal out there, but Eric, it\u2019s all yours. Eric Gehringer : Ben, to be very clear, the answer to your question is yes, we can continue to grow it. Now let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, 2% improvement in the quarter, 3% sequential improvement. To your comment, best quarter we\u2019ve ever had and June was the highest month in the history of Union Pacific at 9,600 feet. And we want to give a lot of credit to our team. That\u2019s hard work to do that. Now when we have conversations about TrainLink, we also got to remind ourselves that since 2019, our mainline derailments are down 42%, while our TrainLink has been up 20%. That\u2019s because we continue to invest in technology and science. And that\u2019s really going to be the continued foundation of how we keep building this out. Yes, to your point, mix makes a difference, but what makes more of a difference is getting more volume on the railroad like we\u2019re seeing with intermodal, that\u2019s been a tailwind for us, but also using our Precision Train Builder software as well as other things that continue to identify opportunities for us to do it. And then on a day to day just fundamentally how we run the railroad and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we still see opportunities to combo trains largely on the bulk side. So yes, there is more opportunity, the team is up against that. I\u2019m looking forward to their continued gains. Ben Nolan : All right. Appreciate. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Hi. Just a couple of demand related questions, follow ups. I think in the first quarter you had mentioned the commodity outlook was muted. Now it\u2019s uncertain. So, I guess first part of the question is and some commodities moved to the positive bucket like international, intermodal and grains. I\u2019m just sort of wondering, are you feeling better or even though it\u2019s uncertain, are you feeling better than you did a quarter ago? And then specifically on coal, obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of carload pressure, but can you give some sense as to the trajectory as we move through the back half of the year in terms of year-over-year pressures? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes. I\u2019ll start with coal first and then work my way back. And again, coal is a natural gas prices are all over the place. If you look at April, they were the lowest on record for a few years and as we move throughout the quarter by June they had bounced back up. It\u2019s very difficult to go out and forecast based on that. We talked about preparedness. We\u2019re talking with Eric\u2019s team daily to make sure we can capture the demand that\u2019s out there. I\u2019ve been very encouraged that our commercial team is talking to each coal customer, each coal receiver one by one to see when they can add in set. So, we\u2019re doing everything we can to influence the demand there. So, overall demand, let\u2019s just talk about a few things. One, on the international, intermodal side, that\u2019s been a strength for us. I think that will stay with us at least for the quarter. I can\u2019t see out further than that. I talked about a little bit earlier the positives we\u2019re seeing from that on the domestic side and the products that we have up against it to go out there and grow. Grain, you had a question about grain. Hey, look, the crop looks great right now as it stands today. The demand looks what I call stable. We\u2019ll see what happens on the export market. But while we are waiting for the export market, our commercial team is engaging those domestic receivers. And Mexico is also an area from a business development perspective that we want. So, we can\u2019t just wait around for some of these markets to help us out. We\u2019re doing something about it and making something happen. Automotive, same thing. We talked about the wins. What I hadn\u2019t talked about is that we\u2019ve had some products where Eric has helped us out where we\u2019ve had land bridge opportunities. So, again very specific actions up against the service and the product to really help overcome some of these other macroeconomic challenges on the housing and industrial side. Jordan Alliger : Okay. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thank you. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. A \u2013 Jim Vena : Good morning, Bascome. Bascome Majors : Good morning, Jim. Jim and Jennifer, you both talked about having to get past some of the inflationary pressures. And I know you mentioned contracts referring to the labor agreement. I know in the past, this time last year, you were talking about some of the purchased services pressure as well. Can you help us understand kind of where you\u2019re tracking when you blend your sense of inflation and overall labor with both the contractual rates and then some of the work rule adjustments and purchased service. Like where is that today? How does that compare to last year? And what\u2019s the steady state as you look at two, three years to understand what we\u2019re really pricing against the marketplace today? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, thanks for the question, Bascome. So, coming into the year, we said that we thought our full-year inflation would be around 5% or so. I think we\u2019re probably tracking pretty close to that. We\u2019re seeing some wins in some of the purchased service categories, seeing a little bit greater acceptance in the marketplace, few more people coming into bid. So, that\u2019s encouraging and certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us to get a little bit better pricing on that purchase services side of the world. Same with materials to a certain extent, obviously that plays more into our CapEx spend than it does the OE, but both are very important to us, right. We\u2019re looking to control costs at every turn. Comp and benefits certainly is a big piece of our expenses. That inflation, I would say, is still probably running around that 5% level that we talked to coming into the year. I think as you all know, we\u2019ve got a 4.5% wage increase that became effective. The last one in this round of negotiations became effective July 1 for our craft professionals. So, I don\u2019t see a lot changing there. It\u2019s just some moving pieces and parts and we\u2019re trying to find areas where we can try to mitigate that either through our productivity, through our purchasing and how we\u2019re just running the railroad in general. And obviously, that\u2019s the task that we have up against Kenny and his team is, these are the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re facing, this is what\u2019s going into the cost structure and we need to go out there, have those tough conversations and the team is doing that and I feel very confident about that. Bascome Majors : To that point, if we get into next year, it sounds like it\u2019s probably a safer expectation to think still closer to that 5% range than maybe the 2.5% to 3% we saw for a long time? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s too soon to say, Bascome, at this point. But boy, my hope is that we\u2019re talking about a number that\u2019s less than 5% next year as we move in. It seems like all of those indicators are moving in the right direction, but we\u2019ll look at that. I think to your point though, when I look back historically, we used to talk about an inflation rate that was around 2%. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get back to those levels, but certainly, we\u2019re going to work to push it down below 5%. Jim Vena : The only thing I would add Bascome is, there\u2019s a lot of indicators that tell us that there\u2019s a change, what\u2019s happening to inflation, overall inflation, CPI, what\u2019s happening to the job market and what\u2019s happening to the input costs for us. So, those things are trending the right way, but how much of a drop we\u2019re going to see next year, we\u2019ll see, but I\u2019d rather have that view than where we were a year ago. Bascome Majors : Thank you both. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Ravi. Christyne McGarvey : Hey, good morning. This is Christyne McGarvey on for Ravi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to circle back to the business development conversation and maybe ask the question in a slightly different way. Just curious if you guys have seen any notable changes in terms of the makeup of the pipeline or maybe even more particularly customer behavior. Just as think about pipeline conversion, is there anything out there with macro or political development that kind of leaving shippers with some decision paralysis that wears off in the coming months and that could start to see conversion accelerate, but just be curious on that angle how you guys are thinking about things? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So, the pipeline is strong. It\u2019s a robust pipeline. We feel good about the pipeline both near-term and over the next couple of years. The conversion rates haven\u2019t changed. We keep an eye on that. I know where it is there. What we saw here recently is the realization rates, meaning if a customer said, hey, it\u2019s going to be 100 cars, it wasn\u2019t as high as 100 cars. And, so you would expect as the markets improve that realization rate to also go up. Again, we\u2019re looking at the same macroeconomic indicators. Hey, if housing starts to move, you know what, that moves a lot of things. That\u2019s cement, that\u2019s PVC, that\u2019s roofing, that\u2019s the carpet that goes in there, that\u2019s glass, that\u2019s the soda ash we move. We play a role in all those products. And so, we\u2019ll see where that happens. But, the theme here is that the markets are going to do what the markets are going to do. We are going out and creating our own markets again through product development and business development and doing it as efficiently as possible as we can. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. Christyne McGarvey : Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe one from a capital efficiency standpoint. So, Jim, how do you feel about the assets you guys have today? I think you all mentioned in the prepared remarks you could flex the fleet up and down. Utilization probably always go up, but obviously there\u2019s longer term savings. So, how do you balance the need to refresh some of the fleet? How do you think about capital spending in this environment just potentially ahead of more volume growth as we look forward from here? Jim Vena : Yes, I think we built our capital plan. We always build it from bottom up to see what we need to do and we\u2019re very comfortable with the $3.4 billion that we have this year and we don\u2019t see any substantial difference in our capital plan moving forward. Now, do we do have the capability, you heard us talk about buying back $1.5 billion of shares, you\u2019ve heard us on the cash that we\u2019re producing. So, if we need to, if there\u2019s something out there that really we need to spend money on, we\u2019ll do that. But, as far as the railroad, the assets, the plant that\u2019s fixed, we don\u2019t fool around with that. What we need to spend, we spend and then we have also built into that $3.4 billion was development and what we can do to drive more business to our railroad. So, I\u2019m very comfortable, that\u2019s the way you should think about it. I don\u2019t see a big change as we move ahead. Jennifer, anything else you wanted to add? Jennifer Hamann : No, you hit it just right. Jim Vena : Okay, thank you. Daniel Imbro : And so, share repurchases would be expected use of excess free cash flow, if cash flow came in stronger, Jim, is that the right way to interpret that comment? Jennifer Hamann : Yes, I mean, so I\u2019ll jump in here. I mean, the priorities for our cash spending, we\u2019ve been, I think, very clear on. First dollar goes back into the business, then we prioritize our dividend, which again, just you saw that we gave the 3% increase here last week and then the excess cash is going to share. So yes, if we have, if you look historically at what we\u2019ve put into our share repurchase program, it\u2019s been greater than the $1.5 billion. Some of that\u2019s been using balance sheet capacity. We don\u2019t intend to add any leverage this year. We feel good about our leverage levels, but we\u2019re going to try to drive more cash and if that\u2019s available, we would put it to shares. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with you question. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Kenny, a quick one for you on intermodal pricing for domestic. Obviously, the truck markets remain weak. I\u2019m just wondering if sequentially you\u2019re seeing anything month-to-month of those rates sort of firming or how that direction looks into the back half of the year? And then, bigger picture question for you Jim on the STP wanting to sort of convene a council to discuss railroad growth. I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on kind of why you think the regulators pulling this thing together and maybe some early views of what you guys think you might have to say at that? Kenny Rocker : David, Jim, I\u2019ll take the first one. So look, we\u2019ve been 18 months now, a little bit over 18 months where domestic intermodal pricing has either been going down or just staying at the bottom. And, I\u2019m not going to sit here today and try to forecast when it\u2019s going to move up, which I\u2019m highlighting the 18 months because it\u2019s been quite a time here and so we\u2019ll see what happens. Here is the key thing I want you to focus on is that I mentioned here recently we\u2019ve been able to see some year-over-year growth on domestic intermodal. We\u2019ve got a group of private asset providers that give us a lot of add backs, a lot of options and we\u2019ve been really as a company doubling down on our product development. So, that when things change, and they will change, but I\u2019m not going to forecast it, we\u2019ll be prepared. Jim Vena : Listen, I appreciate the question on the STB. I think we have the exact same goal as the STB on growth. We want to grow our business and I think we\u2019ve done a, if you actually listen carefully to what we said, we\u2019ve been able to grow our business even with some markets that are giving us some huge headwinds and that\u2019s a pretty good quarter. And, if you watch the carloads that we\u2019ve so far this month, I\u2019m pretty happy with where we\u2019re headed. We\u2019re going to have up and down, but we are working hard on that. So, I think it\u2019s a great hearing. I\u2019m looking forward to it. I can\u2019t make it personally, because we are headed to Dallas and I\u2019m looking forward to those couple of days and that sort of is right in between when we need to be in Dallas, just before it. But, guess who is going and Kenny is going there, he is going to represent us well and I\u2019m looking forward to presenting to everybody to see who Union Pacific is, what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re going to leverage this great franchise to be able to grow our business even with all the challenges that we have. So, I\u2019m excited to hear what all the other railroads have to say and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all in the same place. We all want to be price smart and also be able to move the products that are available to us. So, I\u2019m looking forward to the hearing and Kenny, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to represent this real well. Kenny Rocker : I\u2019m ready. You bet you, Jim. Jim Vena : Thank you very much for the question. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jim Vena for closing comments. Jim Vena : Well, listen, thanks everybody for listening in this morning. We are very excited with what we\u2019ve been able to deliver as a team for our shareholders and what we\u2019ve been able to do safety through the communities that we operate for our employees and we\u2019re very excited that we\u2019ve been able to take the head on challenges that were presented and be able to deliver a quarter that showed improvements both underneath on how we operate and how we operate even safer and the metrics that we\u2019re moving ahead. So, I\u2019m very comfortable where we are. I like our future. I think we got a great railroad and I truly am looking forward to Dallas. I think it\u2019s a great spot to go and have our Investor Day. And, at the Investor Day, we\u2019ll take you through with a little more substance about what we foresee in the future over the next two or three years and what we see in the next year that Union Pacific can deliver. And, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing all of you that can make it in Dallas, wonderful location, great spot for us, an important place for us. So, thank you very much everybody for listening in. Operator : This will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin. Jim Vena : Good morning, Rob, beautiful morning in Omaha, nice fall day. So good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's third quarter results. I'm joined in Omaha, by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As you'll hear from the team, our third quarter results do an excellent job of capturing the progress we've made under our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. And you're seeing how that leads to financial success. I'm very pleased with where we sit today compared to where we started a little over a year ago. Now let's discuss third quarter results, starting on Slide number 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 third quarter net income of $1.7 billion, a 9% improvement and earnings per share of $2.75, a 10% improvement. Third quarter operating revenue gained 3% of strong volumes and core pricing gains were impacted by our business mix and less fuel surcharge revenue. Excluding fuel, freight revenue increased 5% versus 2023. Reported expenses year-over-year improved 2%, while fuel prices were a driver. The team did an excellent job generating productivity to control costs as we successfully handled a 6% increase in volume. Our third quarter operating ratio of 60.3% improved 310 basis points versus last year, further demonstrating our ability to be operationally excellent while maintaining a resource buffer to handle unforeseen events. Look, it was another really good quarter. I'm pleased with how we flex to handle the 33% increase in international intermodal volume during the quarter, while improving service metrics across our network. And yes, that mix of business pressured margins a bit. But at the end of the day, it's about operating as efficiently as possible to drive increases in net income and free cash flow. And as Jennifer will walk you through, we did an excellent job of delivering in those areas. It's another proof point that our strategy is working. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to question and answers. So we'll start with the third quarter financials. Jennifer, over to you. Jennifer Hamann : Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Let's begin on Slide 5 with a walk down of our third quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6.1 billion increased 3% versus 2023 on a 6% volume increase and third quarter freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 4% compared to last year. Breaking down the freight revenue components, increased volume in the quarter added 550 basis points. Strong core pricing gains were more than offset by business mix, reducing freight revenue 75 basis points. As I mentioned at Investor Day, International Intermodal's average revenue per car is significantly lower than our system average. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million was flat versus last year as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Wrapping up the top-line, other revenue declined $73 million or 18%, driven by several factors : lower access oils resulting from the second quarter intermodal equipment sales reduced demand for auto part shipments at our subsidiary, the ongoing transfer of metro operations and a onetime contract settlement of $12 million during the quarter all contributed to the decrease. As a reminder, there are cost savings across our expense lines associated with the ongoing revenue impact from the equipment sales and metro transfer. Switching then to expenses, third quarter operating expense of $3.7 billion improved 2%, driven by strong productivity and lower fuel prices that more than offset volume-related expenses. There are more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers. Compensation and benefits expense increased 2% versus last year as wage inflation, including the July 1st, 4.5% increase and volume costs were partially offset by 5% lower workforce levels and record workforce productivity. Trained service employees were flat year-over-year, as we used our buffer resources to handle increased quarterly volume. All other workforce areas decreased 8%, reflecting our continued focus on operational excellence. Cost per employee in the third quarter increased 8% as a result of higher incentive compensation as well as additional wage inflation related to the work rest labor agreements. Purchased services and material expense improved 4% as cost to maintain a lower active locomotive fleet, and decreased subsidiary drayage expenses were partially offset by inflation and volume related expenses. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 13% on a 17% decrease in fuel prices from $3.12 to $2.60 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, related to the significant growth in less fuel-efficient intermodal traffic, which offset our year-over-year productivity gains. Finally, other expense was better by 6%, reflecting the impact of write-offs in 2023 that more than offset inflation and volume costs. The result of solid revenue growth and strong cost control was third quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, up 11% versus 2023. Below the line, other income decreased $19 million from lower real estate income, while interest expense declined 6% or $20 million on lower average debt levels. Income tax expense increased 23%, driven by higher pre-tax income and state income tax reductions in 2023. Third quarter net income of $1.7 billion, increased 9% versus 2023, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in double-digits earnings per share growth to $2.75. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60.3% improved 310 basis points year-over-year with nearly half of that coming from core operational improvement. As we discussed in Dallas at our Investor Day, operating ratio is an outcome of our strategy and not the goal. Our goal is to grow earnings and generate more cash for our shareholders, which we achieved even as our revenue growth and margins were impacted by mix. Looking now at cash, shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 6. Year-to-date cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, up $700 million versus last year. Our cash flow conversion rate improved to 83% and free cash flow has almost doubled versus 2023, up over $900 million. These improvements are driven by 2023 labor agreement payments and growth in operating income, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Year-to-date, our shareholders have received $3.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases, including third quarter repurchases of $738 million. Finally, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.7x, as we maintain a strong balance sheet and remain A rated by our three credit rating agencies. So wrapping up on Slide 7, with just over two months left in the year, the majority of 2024 story has been written and it's been a good one. We are executing on the fundamentals of railroading, which is critical to achieving the full financial potential of this franchise. We are affirming our prior 2024 guidance, most importantly that we will continue to improve profitability through our strategy of safety, service and operational excellence. Pricing dollars will exceed our inflation dollars. We will purchase $1.5 billion of shares and invest roughly $3.4 billion of capital and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We also are going to put a slightly finer point on how we expect to close the year. At this time, we'd expect fourth quarter results to closely mirror the third quarter, while improving on a year-over-year basis. This level of performance will mark our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gains, again demonstrating the positive results of our strategy. Throughout the year, we've shown our ability to pivot and flex to handle the various challenges of railroading, from weather of all types to the significant West Coast traffic spike, and we navigated them successfully, improving service, while maintaining cost discipline. We continue to generate strong pricing and productivity, positioning us well to finish 2024 with momentum and on a path to achieve the long-term targets we laid out last month. I'll now turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid third quarter. Freight revenues totaled $5.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 5%, excluding fuel surcharges, due to increased volume and strong core pricing gains. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment, revenue for the quarter was up 2%, compared to last year on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car based on a positive mix in traffic and solid core pricing gains. Coal continued to face difficult market conditions in the quarter, resulting from reduced coal demand due to high inventory levels and competition from low natural gas prices. Grain products volumes increased for the quarter due to business development wins and new facilities supporting renewable diesel and associated byproducts, as we highlighted last month at our Investor Day. Lastly, export grain business was up for the quarter, primarily driven by corn and wheat. We continue to win business moving to Mexico, as their domestic consumption outpaces production. Moving to Industrial. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% for the quarter, on a 2% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car increased by 5% due to strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. Petroleum shipments increased for the quarter due to strong business development efforts in various markets like asphalt and lube oil. Petrochemicals volumes continued to grow due to domestic demand in plastics and new business wins in our industrial chemicals market. However, those gains were more than offset by the softer demand for rock against last year's record shipment. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 7% on a 14% increase in volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting increased international intermodal shipments, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were down due to unplanned production adjustments, partially offset by business wins with Volkswagen and General Motors. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong. Our international intermodal volume was up 33%, significantly outpacing growth seen in West Coast imports. Import strength also drove increased domestic volume, which we were able to capitalize on due to our diverse IMC network. Now turning to Slide 10. Here is our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk. Coal is expected to remain challenged, as inventories remain high, and we see competition from low natural gas prices. Moving to Grain. We are optimistic due to a strong supply in UP's franchise areas, and we have secured additional new facilities that will ensure domestic growth, generating long-term ratable grain demand. We expect ongoing strength in the Mexico export market as the UP continues to increase its share south of the border. Additionally, we expect continued growth in the grain products tied to renewable fuels and their associated feedstocks. The team is focused on capturing business as production continues to ramp up at new facilities brought online, such as Bartlett's crush facility in Cherryvale, Kansas. Turning to Industrial. As we mentioned earlier, we expect the rock market will not match last year's record volume. For petroleum, we have tougher comps but are building on our success with business development. Petrochemicals is expected to outperform the market, based on the strength of our Gulf Coast franchise, and we are excited to see incremental volume from Shintech's expansion at Plaquemines, Louisiana. And wrapping up with Premium. On the intermodal side, the surge of West Coast import volumes will continue to drive for both our international and domestic markets for the remainder of the year. In Automotive, we are seeing softness in the market, which will be partially offset by business development wins. In summary, I'm proud of the commercial team. We're going to see the strongest volume year since 2029. Our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum, and our resource buffer puts us in a great position to manage increased volumes on the West Coast. The team is focused on our key growth markets, collaborating with our customers and the operating team to find innovative solutions to grow and win together. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in September, we always believe there's a better way to do things, even the things we're doing well today. And that culture has manifested itself in our results, as we continue to make great progress in our safety, service performance and efficiency metrics. Starting with safety. We remain intensely focused on our four pillar strategy to prevent injuries and drive down derailments. As a result, year-to-date both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While we are not there yet, we are clearly on the path to become the safest railroad. Freight car velocity improved 5% to 210 miles per day compared to third quarter 2023. Additionally, throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity near 220 miles per day. A favorable business mix coupled with continued improvements in terminal dwell has driven the performance. Notably, we achieved a third quarter record in terminal dwell, a 5% improvement versus last year. Intermodal and Manifest Service Performance Index saw a 1 and 5 point improvement year-over-year respectively. As demonstrated by our results, the team took quick action throughout the quarter to deploy buffer resources and adjust trip plans minimizing the impact of a 33% surge in international intermodal shipments. These swift actions not only allowed us to effectively absorb the increased volumes, but also mitigated the impact on our broader network. Now let\u2019s review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. In addition to our service product, the team remains hyper-focused on driving productivity throughout the network. The more productive we are, the better we put ourselves in a position to compete and you can see we did that in the third quarter. Locomotive productivity improved 5%, compared to third quarter 2023. While increased fluidity of the network has enabled our performance, the team also continued its focus on reducing locomotive dwell. In fact, this quarter our locomotive dwell results tied for the best ever quarterly performance, a 5% year-over-year improvement. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 12% versus 2023. Impressively, both the month of September and the third quarter marked all-time records for their respective periods. Our continued work to leverage technology and automate operations across our transportation, mechanical and engineering team is paying dividends. Not only is it driving efficiencies, but it's also improving the safety of how we work. Train length was flat for the third quarter. After experiencing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in July, we've made steady sequential improvement throughout the quarter and ended September with a monthly record over 9,600 feet. These improvements are a direct result of targeted transportation plan changes and capital investments, such as siding extensions and technology. While we have made great strides this year to improve train length, there are still opportunities to safely improve, as we strive to generate mainline capacity for current and future growth. To wrap up, great work by the team, as they efficiently leverage our buffer resources to handle the influx in volumes. However, as I opened with, there is always opportunity to get better and I'm confident the team will continue pushing in our pursuit of industry leading safety, service and operational excellence. Jim? Jim Vena : Thank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize, what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, we did a great job of adding volume to our network in an efficient manner. And given the margin profile of that volume, it was imperative that we did so. We also continue to generate strong pricing that reflects the value we're creating for our customers. Again imperative to mitigate the mix dynamic in the quarter. Kenny gave an overview of third quarter volumes and laid out thoughts for the remainder of the year. The team is making no excuses and going after every available carload. While international intermodal gets a lot of attention these days, there are plenty of additional markets, where the team is winning to bring new customers to the railroad over the short-term and long-term. Lastly, Eric updated our progress to improve safety service and operational excellence. Year-to-date our safety metrics continue to show great improvement, but they're just the initial steps toward being industry-leading. On the service front, the operating team did a great job of improving service, while we handled more business. That was possible due to the efficiency of our network and our ability to maximize asset utilization. While the business of railroading can be unpredictable, it's the fundamentals of how you operate the company anticipating and reacting to change that ultimately matters. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I'm very pleased with where we sit today. When I joined the company, I said, we had pressures that were going to take us a couple of years to get by some of the inflationary pressures. But, as you heard at our Investor Day last month, we have the right team and the right strategy to make take this company to new heights. This is just the beginning of the journey. So with that, we're excited, we're ready and we're ready to take your questions. Rob? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today will be coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Good morning, Jim and team. Thank you for the question. I guess, two things. One, can you just clarify, when you talk consistent with last quarter, are you talking on an operating ratio level? Are you talking on a revenue or op income level? Just want to clarify that. And then, I guess, Kenny, it seems coal has taken a big step down lately. Can you talk about what puts and takes about what's built into the full year target that you're targeting there? Jennifer Hamann : I'll start with that then, Ken. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, when we say consistent, and we say results, we're being pretty broad there. But, yes, I mean, I think we see are the as we look at what's going to happen in the fourth quarter. We see the outcomes being very similar across all of those categories in terms of our fourth quarter results. So consistent is consistent. Kenny Rocker : Yes. On the coal side, no surprises with coal. We'd expect what you're seeing in the public numbers, those volumes to continue through the rest of the year. That's why I made a point to focus on if you look at that bulk line, doing everything we can to counter some of those challenges on the coal side with renewable fuels and with the grain network. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Chris Wetherbee : Good morning, guys. I guess I just maybe wanted to understand a little bit about how you think about the intermodal outlook and maybe how that influences that comment around the fourth quarter. So we came off of what has been a remarkable sort of preloaded peak season potentially in the third quarter, particularly for international. Do you see the mix start to change a little bit, but maybe sort of work that into a little bit of the drivers of that consistency in the fourth quarter? It would be helpful. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I'll start with that, Chris, and then Kenny can weigh in relative to the volume. I mean, we believe the mix pressures are going to continue into the fourth quarter. You also see just kind of that normal seasonality. You have a little bit lower volume, you've got the holidays, tend to have a little bit of weather. There's those things. The other thing that I think folks need to pay attention to is fuel on a year-over-year basis and even sequentially, because you have a much different dynamic from fuel. We think our fuel surcharge is probably going to be $200 million or so less in the fourth quarter. And when you're looking at how it contributed positively in the third quarter and as a drag on fourth quarter, there's a lot of puts and takes there that I think you need to pay attention to that, I think help maybe fill in some of those blanks as well as just the mix impact. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. On a year-over-year basis, I think we could expect international intermodal to be elevated. Although, as we go throughout the quarter and you can see that in some of the numbers now, you're seeing it start to step down a little bit. One of the things that I just want to highlight again is the preparedness for the team to be able to accept and anticipate that 33% increase. And so, we're very encouraged by that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, in your prepared remarks, you kind of alluded to margins that perhaps weren't what you were hoping. Is that to say that kind of the prior margin improvement that you achieved in your first few years ago is not possible in the current environment or is it just taking longer? And I think, I'm just curious whether your mention of an industry-leading OR. Do you think that that is in effect for next year? In other words, can you have an industry-leading OR as early as next year? Jim Vena : I think we have an industry leading OR for the last number of quarters including this one. I think we're the last ones to report and I'm pretty safe to say that. Walter, let's back up a little bit. People are in different positions of where and what we started. I remember back in 2019 where I joined, we parked 1,000 plus locomotives closer to 1,500. We adjusted the number of people that took to operate the railroad and those were big changes and we did those already. I think I was here and then I went on sabbatical and now I'm back. And am I done? Absolutely not. But, it's a lot different place to start where I came back 13, 14 months ago, than it was if I would have come, if we were in the same situation as 2019. We will be the best margin operating ratio company this year and I don't see any reason for us not to continue that and we will look at ways. Now inflationary pressure and I said it from the very first call I was on is, it's not going to be an easy one to get over. We are pushing price, but also being cognizant that we only get, the customers have to see value in that. They have to understand that we're giving them a product that allows them to win in the marketplace. And we've done that with the revenue coming in and pricing higher than what inflation is. So what I see is exactly what we laid out in our Investor Day. We see EPS growth high single-digits to low double-digits. We have the opportunity with the cash that we're providing that if we don't come up with another use for that we can buy back $4 billion to $5 billion versus shares. And we are absolutely online to set operating ratio improvement at the Union Pacific. So that's the way I see it Walter. Hopefully I answered your question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Andre on for Jordan. Thanks for taking my question. With headcount down 5% year-over-year and carload growth up nicely at 6%, you achieved strong incremental margins in the quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. Could you just talk a little bit more about the productivity opportunity set that you guys are taking and the actions there and how that sets up for 2025, incremental if industrial production can actually accelerate from here? Eric Gehringer : Absolutely, Andre. Let's start by level-setting on what we did. So you start thinking about locomotive dwell. In my prepared comments, I talked about we've tied the best quarterly results that we've ever had before. Workforce productivity 12% monthly and quarterly record. TrainLink September best month ever in the history of Union Pacific and certainly a quarterly record in 2Q. But as we look at that, productivity is not new for us. Since 2019, we've driven approximately $1.4 billion in productivity and you're going to see us continue to find opportunities. We work on it every single day. Let's talk about what some of those are. When I start talking about workforce, I always break it down for my team, it's fundamentals, it's agreements, it's technology. On the fundamentals, I still see opportunities for us to be able to improve our recur rate. We've done improvement. There's still more opportunity there. When you look at the number of people that we use in our yard and local, you heard Jim talk about the inflationary pressures of a 4% wage increase to start the year and a 4.5% at July 1st. Yet, if you look at our wages that we're paying, we've actually been able to offset some of that inflation through productivity. That's technology, that's process. You're going to continue to see us do that. Fuel is going to still be a big opportunity for us. Whether you're talking about process or whether you're talking about technology, it's a huge expense for us and it's one we got to continue to work through. Our work with EMS, which is Energy Management, our work on how we think about filling our locomotives, where do we fill the most locomotives at the lowest cost, we've driven that compliance now north of 90%, where we started the year significantly lower. That's still an opportunity for us. I'll tell you the list goes on, and on, and on. When I say we work on it every day, I really mean that. It's safety, it's service, it's productivity. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hi. Thanks for the time. Eric, I had a question for you on the intermodal train speeds. The data we're looking at from the outside looking in, those numbers are trending kind of as low as they've been. We've seen some issues on dwell at the West Coast ports as well. How do I reconcile some of those external data points with the performance that you guys are driving in the results today in terms of talking about the best ever TrainLink, best ever improvements in intermodal customer service? I'm just trying to square that circle, because it's come up in a couple of client conversations. Eric Gehringer : Yes. Thank you for the question, David. Here's how I reconcile it. It tells you that 220 is not as good as we can be, because to your point, we've seen dramatic improvements in both the manifest and bulk side and we've seen improvements on some lanes in intermodal, we've continued to work to be able to improve that. Now let's be really frank, 33% increase in international intermodal without much advance notice, if any advance notice, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished to be able to handle that. Now what do we have to continue to do to build back that intermodal speed that you're talking about? Well, it's the things we're doing right now. So when we talk about deploying our buffer resources, that's taken the form of locomotives and cars into the LA Basin. We've staged our trains across the system, so that we take every train, excuse me, every car that we can into the ports and we take every car that they can give us back. We work closely with the CSX and the NS to ensure that our interchange points remain fluid. These are the things we need to continue to execute, as we continue to capture that volume and I expect in short order that, that intermodal speed will turn the other way and that will continue to add on top of the excellent performance we have already. Jim Vena : David, I need to sort of add on a little bit from what Eric said. I followed up with both LA and Long Beach Board here earlier this week and we both came to the same conclusion. No one told us first or second quarter that we were going to see a 33% increase and it was an event that happened because of East Coast ports issues, the Canadian issues. The big question is, how did we handle it, and you know that when something happens that is thrown on you, you start moving intermodal equipment and you don't get the same speed and you don't get the same velocity and we knew we were not going to be able to maintain that. But let's see where the success is or failure by the supply chain. Ships are not being held out at LA and Long Beach. They are arriving and going on the way they normally do with that kind of increase in business. As far as the fluidity of our terminals, we're in great shape. We've been able to turn the containers and the customers have done a fantastic job of pulling those containers off and delivering. The only place that we'd love it, if we have been able to plan it is, we'd have faster velocity if we could have been told that, it was coming and seen it a little sooner so we could place cars in the right place, work on the terminals we have at the West Coast a little differently and be able to speed it up. I'm very proud. I think the customers have seen what LA and Long Beach can do and I think that they it will be part of their decision making as they move ahead to say can LA and Long Beach handle an increase of business and I think it can and we've proven that point. It's a heck of a success story for us. I love the story. I love that you look at our metrics real good, and I'm sure that you've seen that, we're running over 220 miles per day for our cars and that's what's really important to us as we keep the place fluid. Thank you very much. Great question, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Mike Triano : Hi, Jim. This is Mike Triano on for Tom. If we look at workforce productivity and locomotive productivity, they're both up mid-single-digits through September and they've been a driver of OR improvement this year despite the volume and the mix headwinds. If we look out to next year, the volume backdrop is still kind of murky, but volumes are kind of flat to up. Do you think you can get another mid-single-digits improvement in those productivity metrics? Jim Vena : We're sticking to our guidance for next year, which I think that's it. We've set it out, we thought about it. It's very, very definitive about what we want to deliver next year. So unless the economy implodes in the United States, we're very comfortable that it's that we're going to be able to deliver that. So I'm very proud of when you get that kind of productivity number that we delivered this last quarter and we don't see any reason for us not to be able to take a look at what we're doing on the railroad to continue to improve productivity. We know that, we're carrying extra people, because of some of the collective agreements that we still have to implement from the last round. We're being very prudent on that side, but you could see on the non-operating side, what we've been able to do to still operate the railroad in a very efficient manner. We do that every day, take a look at it and I'm very comfortable that we're headed the right way. Jennifer, anything to add? Jennifer Hamann : No. I just would reiterate and it's really kind of what Eric talked about too. When we look at all the areas of expense and on the capital side, we have areas to improve our productivity and we have action plans against that for the rest of this year and going into 2025 and beyond. That's what really gives us the confidence to say, there's certainly great runway ahead of us and we're very confident in our ability to perform. Operator : The next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe wanted to ask a broader one, just from a competitive standpoint, I know it's hard to know, but your Western peers have been more vocal, but wanted to improve it. I'm curious if you're noticing anything different when you're out there bidding on business or going head-to-head with them in the market. And then, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned merchandise pricing was positive. Just curious how you're seeing core merchandise pricing out there in the market, if it's changing at all? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : If you look at the size of the pie, we're really competing against truck. We're putting together a service product to go out there and compete against truck, against sourcing, to a lesser degree against barge. So we're doing what we can do to go out there and grow and win share and focus on Union Pacific and what we can control. That's that. The second part of your question, look, I'm proud of the team to be able to go out and lead with the capital investments that we put into the network for our customers, to lead with the inflationary pressures that we can have, the buffer resource that Jim and Eric talked about, and now we talked a little bit about the velocity. We tie it all to the service and we're aligning those pricing with the service product that's there. So, yes, the team has been able to go out there and secure some strong pricing on that merchandise business of the freight. Jim Vena : Kenny, the only thing I would add is this and I think it's a valid point to make. I want the entire industry to operate very efficiently. I want the entire industry to be able to operate in a manner that allows us all to grow. We interchange a lot of traffic not quite 50%, but around 40% touches another railroad, whether it's a short line or one of the other railroads in the United States. The more we can all be efficient, when we interchange traffic, when we move it across the Mississippi, when we move it with our Western competitor. We love to compete, but there's a lot of traffic, if we're both efficient on, we get to be able to move that from other modes of transportation. Now I've worked with people, if I was smiling last night when I was thinking about this, how many people that I've worked with that are at other railroads, whether it's CPKC now even Burlington Northern Santa Fe, whether it's CSX or whether it's Norfolk Southern. So we come from a culture all of us that have worked together that we operate railroads in an efficient manner and we move ahead so that we want all of us want growth. I'm not speaking for the rest of them, I'm speaking for us at Union Pacific. Now given all that, listen, I can control what we do, not what everybody else does. I'm very comfortable with where we are and what we can do in the kind of business mix that we have. And you could see at this last quarter and what we've been able to deliver and what we see moving forward. I'm excited. I think the industry is in a better place now than it was 10 years ago and 5 years ago, and I'm sure better than we were in 2022. It's a wonderful place to be and we'll even continue to get better. That little competition with all the people you know is the best thing you can have. Nothing better than beating all the people that you know and that's what we want to do. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Good morning, Jim. Kenny, I was going to ask this anyway, maybe a pretty well-timed follow-up to the last one. So the arc up 5% in both bulk and industrial obviously points to your pricing. Jim says that, customers have to see value in the service and you're seeing that. But with inflation conceptually coming down a little bit, the volume headwinds remaining, to keep that type of pricing momentum despite the good service, do you need a little bit of help from the volume side, from the macro, from demand to continue to push price or at a certain point is that kind of cap out without getting some volume tailwind? Kenny Rocker : Yes. The macro is the macro, and those are things that are out of our control, Jon. We focus on the network. We focus on the service that Eric is providing us, the investments we're making, and we link that to the value of the pricing. We're very crystal clear in how we articulate to our customers. The way we look at it, we see it as something that will definitely continue to happen. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, maybe just to come back to the one of the initial comments you had earlier here, and then also something you said when you first came on board. Just to take a little while to get over the labor challenges that you sort of inherited on the network. Obviously, we've seen mix in coal not help and then just the broader inflationary trend. Maybe just to help level set things a little bit, you said it's going to take a while. Can you offer any sort of context in terms of what the timing should be, if it's going to be gradual or if there's some step change that we could be thinking of, as we look more broadly to getting over some of these hurdles and probably to a better place than what you started off with? Jim Vena : Brian, thanks for the question. If we -- I don't like to look backwards too much, but I think we've done a great job at Union Pacific, all 30,000 of us, to be able to deliver where we are comparatively to everybody else. Now growth is real important to us and we've done a great job of providing service at a high level. Remember service is what we sold the customer not other measures that are out there to talk about what service is, is we measure individually to every one of our customers about what level of service that we sold them. We put that in the mix and we had inflationary pressure. That's why we are very clear on what our three year expectation is, Brian, of what our results should be and what we think we can deliver. I'm very comfortable where we are and I think we'll see improvements in our operating ratio. We'll see improvements over time over our net income and improvements in our EPS that drives value for our shareholders. Very comfortable. This was always at the very start, I said it was going to be a couple of years. It's still a couple of years. It was not going to be easy and it's not easy to get to overcome some of the things. But I think we've done a good job with pricing growth and coal. Coal is coal, like coal is down 20%. At the end of the day, if it wasn't down 20%, but that's not the way I look at the world. There's always challenges. If there was no challenges, then I would have stayed retired and enjoyed myself in Scottsdale, Arizona this morning going for a hike to Camelback. I'm here because I think there's something to do and we can get this company moving forward. I'm very excited, Brian. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Ben Nolan : Thanks a lot. The service performance index for both intermodal and manifest has been trending up higher. I'm just curious, if you think there's a point where if you arrive at a certain level or if at a certain range where you can really lean more heavily into pricing than maybe you already have or and maybe also just share gains versus competitors, or versus trucking, is that -- is there like a magic number or at least a magic range where you feel like really you have a strong or much stronger competitive advantage? Kenny Rocker : Yes. Jim hit it a little bit earlier and what do we sell to our customers, and how do we translate that into pricing and those discussions. No. There's not a magical number. But clearly, as the service improves, that gives us a better environment to maximize price. Same is true on growth, more consistent, reliable product and better service product. We go in and we ask for more business when we're talking to customers. We ask to look at their truck files. We ask to look at talk to more of their receivers. Clearly, as we improve and we've done a great job here in the third quarter on the service product. It creates our own capacity. It creates our own opportunities regardless of what happens in the macro environment. Ben Nolan : Do you think you're there now? Just, as a follow-up. Kenny Rocker : I hope not. I mean, we always want to improve as a management team. So no, we're going to always strive to improve. There's no time where we're going to yell out we arrived. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Eric Morgan : Hi, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to come back to the mix discussion in the fourth quarter. I think you mentioned mix headwinds continuing in the quarter, maybe with some international intermodal volume growth moderating somewhat. But, can you just talk about some of the mix effects from other commodity groups outside of intermodal? In particular, maybe how you view margin contribution from coal would be helpful, I think. Jennifer Hamann : I'm going to pass on that last part of your question. But, if you just look at our business teams, industrial is the group that has our highest average revenue per car, has very strong contributions to our bottom line, and that business has been down all year. Now, there's always mix within mix, but with the continued pressures in the industrial economy and the continued outlook that those volumes are down year-over-year, that's an impact and that certainly contributes to the mix, in addition to obviously seeing the growth come in some of the lower average revenue per car, kinds of businesses like the international intermodal. On the Bulk side, yes, there's coal, set that aside. Grain, strong grain into Mexico, which is great for us. We really enjoy that business. That's a little bit shorter length of haul than if we're taking it to export out through the West Coast. Again, you have some of that what I'll call mix within mix. Kenny, I don't know if you want to add anything else? Kenny Rocker : Yes. I just want to say we're not going to apologize for accepting the increase. Yes. We'd love the 33% increase. What I'd tell you is that, the management team here did a good job of preparing for it. That's what we did with Phoenix to take trucks off the road, what we did to expand Inland Empire. All these things set us up for success for this unexpected amount of volume that's come on. Jennifer Hamann : That's really why it's so important goes back to Jim's point on the fundamentals. That's why we need to be just diligent about how we're using our resources, our workforce productivity and how we run this railroad, so that we can absorb shocks from mix and still produce a very good quarterly result. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Stephanie Moore : You talked a lot about the strength in export grain to Mexico, but can you also talk a little bit more broadly about your Mexico business? How do you see that going forward? And any thoughts on geopolitical and administration changes as well would be helpful. Kenny Rocker : Yes. First of all, I just want to step back as we're talking about our grain business and our grain network and differentiate renewable fuels and the actual facilities that we've landed there that we've discussed. The same thing with our grain network, the facilities, meaning the 20-plus facilities that have come on and the fact that Cherryvale Kansas facility will help supply grain into Mexico. So let me just kind of break that apart to let you know how we look at it. But then, yes, broadly, as we look at Mexico, Clearly, there's a lot of opportunity with over-the-road trucks. There are some markets like finished vehicles and also auto parts. We have a strong service product coming out there. What differentiates us, Stephanie is, again, the fact that we have multiple partners that can get in that market. We have our own rail box that we can get into that market. And we have daily service into and out of Mexico, which we know we're the only one that has that. So clearly, again, a strong growth area for us. We laid it out in Investor Day. And as far as the administration, we see that it's an environment that they're going to be certainly pro-business and support the freight environment, so we're excited about that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Jennifer, any color on that comp for employees up 8% and how to think about that going forward? And then I know someone else asked already about like what that sort of flat Q4 comment made. But I just -- I guess I'm not sure if that was -- still not sure if that was an earnings or margin or revenue comment. So I don't know any color? Jennifer Hamann : Okay, Scott. So we'll start with the comp for employees. So if you look at the 8% increase, call it, rough numbers, half of that was from the July 1 wage increase. The other half is a combination of higher incentive comp year-over-year as well as higher guarantee payments. That's really associated with the work rest agreements as we've cut over more hubs through the year and also graduated more TE&Y employees from training. So those are all the drivers that we see in there. And for 4Q, it's probably going to look pretty similar, maybe even up a little bit more as we continue to carry some of the extra resources support the implementation of the work rest. And so that's really why you've heard us stress the productivity piece today because we do have inflationary pressures, and that's why that workforce productivity is just absolutely critical for us as well as how we're approaching labor going forward and making sure that we are getting good agreements in place that can help us serve our customers in a very efficient manner while compensating our employees fairly. Going back to your other question about the consistent -- we said results. That's a fairly all-encompassing words. So you could call that any number of measures. But you know what the key ones are that you all look at EPS, operating ratio, operating income, we think it's going to look very similar in 4Q versus 3Q. Operator : Next question is from the line of Elliot Alper with TD Cowen. Elliot Alper : This is Elliott on for Jason Seidl. I believe this is the first quarter this year where your domestic intermodal volume outlook is positive. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the domestic intermodal market in Q4? And I know you already talked about kind of the mix headwinds in international growth and fuel, but we see domestic intermodal growing into the quarter. Could that maybe partially offset intermodal rev per car in Q4? Just trying to gauge the magnitude. Kenny Rocker : So we've been encouraged on the domestic intermodal front, even as late as the second quarter, we saw that line be positive. It's been positive in the third quarter. Now some of that has benefited from the international in a most side. And that's why I keep harping on these products that we have, having a product like Inland Empire helps us capture some of that domestic intermodal, and we've seen some strong demand there. I'll tell you as it looks at -- we look at it for the fourth quarter. Again, we think we'll see a little bit more of a benefit for what's taking place on the international intermodal side, and we'll see what happens as we continue throughout the quarter. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Ariel Rosa with Citigroup. Ariel Rosa : I just wanted to -- I know some other people have spoken about this already, but I wanted to ask about is the target to price above rail inflation. Could you give us color, just to be clear, is that something that's being achieved currently and that we can expect for 2024? And then kind of given the looser capacity environment, would you say that you've kind of gotten more pushback from customers as you have those pricing discussions? Or do you think service is sufficient currently to kind of compensate for whatever the loose truck environment might be doing or the kind of the softer demand environment might be? Jim Vena : Ari, good question. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Yes. So I think you're talking specifically and only about domestic intermodal, you'll have to clear it up, if you can. We've got -- and we've talked about this, we've got price mechanisms for our customers that are in place to keep them competitive. Again, I talked to you about the fact that second quarter, third quarter, we were up in domestic intermodal. So we look at that as a positive outcome for us. We've gone from a trucking environment really since 2022, that's really been stagnant to downward and it's flattish now. We'll see what happens in the next few months, but we feel good about where we're positioned and the ability as it capacity tightens, we're going to see more value on the pricing side. . Jim Vena : Jennifer, do you want to talk about the inflation. Jennifer Hamann : Absolutely. So to that point, in terms of your question, absolutely, our pricing dollars today are exceeding our inflation dollars, and they have throughout this inflationary period, whether you're talking about 2024, you've been going back 2023, 2022. We have been committed to that and we have achieved that. I think the important point really is going forward, and we talked about this at Investor Day, is that not only will we continue to have our price dollars exceed our inflation dollars that it will become accretive to our margins next year. So I feel very bullish on that front. Jim Vena : Ari, good question. Why don't I just wrap it up real quick and then looking-forward to the call in 3 months and looking-forward to finishing off this year just the way we set it up and also delivering on what we said last year? If we look at what we've been able to deliver as a team, 10% increase in earnings per share, 11% up in operating income, 9% up in net income, productivity, up 12%. Those are all numbers that make us very comfortable of how we are operating the railroad and how we're driving business. We think that if we get the service level, and it's very close to where we are right now to the right level, then the discussion is how do we work together with our customers to win in the marketplace and not worried about what the -- whether the service is holding them back from winning in the marketplace. So with that, let me just close off by thanking everybody for joining us this morning. I know there was competing calls, and nice to have you guys all with us this morning and looking-forward to more discussions as we move ahead. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin. Jim Vena : Thank you very much, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Pleased to have you with us this morning. Little bit of winter in some parts of our company, even lots of snow in the Southeast part, but love the way the operating team has worked through it and we are in way better shape already. So great recovery by everybody, but lots of hard work by the men and women of Union Pacific. Why don't we get started. So I'm joined here this morning in Omaha by Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. Let's dig into 2024. It was a very successful year for the Union Pacific team, and we really finished the year on a high note in the fourth quarter to put up an adjusted 58% operating ratio, removing the impact of a new regional Brakeperson Agreement is really excellent work. It shows that the team is executing our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. Now why don't we move over to discuss the fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 fourth quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.91, both 7% improvements. Fourth quarter revenue, excluding the impact of fuel surcharge grew 4%. Our ability to generate strong volume growth and core pricing gains more than offset an unfavorable business mix. Reported expenses year-over-year improved 4%, while lower fuel prices led the way, the team demonstrated strong productivity utilizing 3% fewer employees to move 5% more volume. This led to operating income growth of 5% and the operating ratio outcome that I mentioned earlier. This is the result of the team's commitment to build a safer, more durable and more efficient network. Just a fantastic way to end 2024. Throughout the year, we built momentum behind our strategy and you see that in the financial results we delivered. While internally, we've already turned the page to work on further improvements in 2025, we need to pause and celebrate the team's success in 2024. We set a goal to achieve industry leading results and when the dust settles, I'm confident that's where we'll be. So with that, I'll let the team walk you through the quarter and the year in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to Q&A. We'll start with the fourth quarter and full year financials. Jennifer, it's all yours. Jennifer Hamann : All right. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our fourth quarter income statement on Slide 5. Operating revenue of $6.1 billion decreased 1% versus 2023 against strong volume growth, while our fourth quarter freight revenue finished flat at $5.8 billion, breaking down the drivers of freight revenue, increased volume in the quarter added 525 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue of $588 million declined $207 million as lower year-over-year fuel prices reduced freight revenue 450 basis points. Similar to our third quarter results, strong core pricing gains were more than offset by business mix, reducing freight revenue 100 basis points with our 16% intermodal growth driving that mix dynamic, of significance, our price dollars met the long-term commitment of exceeding inflation dollars, while also being accretive to fourth quarter operating ratio. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 7% as a result of lower accessorial revenue from the second quarter intermodal equipment sale and reduced revenue from the ongoing transfer of metro operations. As a reminder, we see offsets against this revenue decline in operating expense. Switching to expenses, our appendix slides provide more detail, but let me share some highlights of our strong cost control as total operating expense declined 4% to $3.6 billion against a 5% increase in quarterly volume. Looking closer at the expense line, compensation and benefits expense increased 8% compared to fourth quarter 2023, driven by the $40 million Brakeperson Buyout Agreement, which Jim mentioned and wage inflation. This is the second Brakeperson Agreement that we have reached in the last couple of years, both of which have enabled more efficient car handling. Quarterly workforce levels decreased 3%. Our train service employee workforce was flat against the 5% volume growth as we effectively handled the additional volume. All other workforce areas decreased to 4%. These efforts resulted in record workforce productivity, demonstrating our strategic focus on delivering operational excellence. For 2025, we expect our all in cost per employee to be around 4% as we continue to find ways to be more productive with our workforce through process improvements, technology and investment. Fuel expense decreased 23% on a 24% year-over-year fall off in fuel prices from $3.16 to $2.41 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate improved 1% in the quarter as we more than offset the impact of moving a less fuel efficient business mix. Equipment and other rents expense increased 8% due to inflation and volume related growth in our intermodal business. Finally, other expense declined 22%. As you'll recall, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we highlighted elevated casualty costs due to the catch up of case backlogs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we benefited from lower casualty expenses as well as a reduction in bad debt expense. Operating income improved 5% to $2.5 billion and was a fourth quarter record. Below the line, other income decreased $40 million on lower real estate gains, while interest expense declined 6% or $19 million as a result of lower average debt levels. Altogether, these results total a record fourth quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.91, both up 7% versus 2023. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 58.7% improved 220 basis points year-over-year. And as Jim noted, when you adjust for the Brakeperson Agreement, our quarterly OR came in at 58%, a great outcome, reflecting very strong quarterly performance by the UP team as we work to safely and efficiently serve our customers. Moving to Slide 6, let me quickly recap full year 2024. Operating revenue of $24.3 billion grew 1% on a 3% volume increase, core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix. Excluding fuel surcharge, our freight revenue grew 4% versus 2023. Operating income totaled $9.7 billion, a 7% increase and our full year operating ratio of 59.9% improved 240 basis points, both great indicators of how good railroading produces solid operating leverage and cost control. Earnings per share of $11.09 increased 6% versus 2023, while our return on invested capital improved 30 basis points to 15.8%. Let's turn then to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 7. Full year 2024 cash from operations totaled $9.3 billion, up almost $1 billion from 2023. Our cash flow conversion rate improved to 87% and free cash-flow increased from $1.5 billion to $2.8 billion. These year-over-year improvements reflect the change in year-over-year labor agreement payments as well as the growth in our operating income. We rewarded our shareholders returning $4.7 billion in 2024 through dividends and share repurchases. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the year at 2.7 times as we maintain a strong balance sheet and continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies. 2024 proves that our strategy of safety, service and operational excellence leading to growth also generates strong cash returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Kenny. Kenny Rocker : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter. Freight revenues totaled $5.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 4% excluding fuel surcharges due to increased volume. This also reflected strong core pricing gains as a result of our deliberate focus on maximizing price. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment, revenue for the quarter was down 4% compared to last year on a 4% decrease in volume, while Average Revenue per Car remained flat, even with decreased fuel surcharges. Coal continued to experience the same challenges seen throughout the year as demand remained soft due to the high inventory levels and the competition from low natural gas prices. Grain volumes increased for the quarter as there was strength in export grain to Mexico, coupled with UP service during -- strong UP service during the harvest. Lastly, grain products grew in the fourth quarter as our work to locate renewable diesel plants on our railroad is paying dividends in the form of increased demand for feedstocks and we expect that growth to continue with the startup of two new facilities, one in Nebraska and one in Kansas that came online in the fourth quarter, bringing the current count of UP accessible plants to 15 with more expected this year. Turning to industrial, revenue was up 1% for the quarter as volume remained flat. Strong core pricing gains were mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Business development in our Petrochemical and Petroleum commodity segments drove growth. Demand improved for plastics -- for our plastics business in both export and domestic markets. However, these gains were offset by softer demand for Metals, Sand and Rock. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 3% on a 13% increase in volume and a 9% decrease in Average Revenue per Car, reflecting increased intermodal shipments and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal volumes remained strong due to international West Coast import demand and positive domestic growth driven by business development efforts. International volumes were up 26% in the quarter, outpacing the growth rate of the West Coast imports by utilizing our buffer resources, which includes people, locomotive and railcars, our operating team efficiently moved the traffic and maintained fluidity in the supply chain. Automotive volumes were flat due to unplanned downtime, partially offset by business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors. Now, let's focus on 2025. Here are some of the key macroeconomic indicators that we're watching this year on Slide 10. These are S&P Global's forecast from their January report. And you'll notice that it shows a mixed picture for 2025, which is not materially different than what we shared back in September at our Investor Day in Dallas. The forecast for industrial production shows a slight increase, while GDP growth slows from 2024. Housing starts are expected to remain challenged, but with December sharp uptick, we are closely watching the situation. Now turning to Slide 11. Here is Union Pacific's 2025 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, we anticipate coal to continue to decline, though not to the levels we've seen in 2024. We expect coal demand will be met from existing high inventory levels. However, a new contract win with the Lower Colorado River Authority, also known as LCRA will help offset losses from 2025 coal retirement. While it's premature to predict grain export demand, domestic grain demand is expected to remain steady through the first half of 2025, driven by strong grain yields from a good harvest in 2024 as well as our efforts to serve both new and expanding facilities. Lastly, we expect continued strength in grain products, driven by intense business development and the expanding markets for renewable fuels and the associated feedstocks. We will continue to monitor potential changes in renewable diesel incentives and tax credits. Moving on to industrial, while the forecast for industrial production in 2025 remains muted, our diverse business mix, strong service and robust franchise will help us grow in some markets. The metals market is expected to remain soft. However, our industrial chemicals and plastics markets will remain favorable based on plant expansions with multiple strategic customers and our strong focus on business development. This strong focus is all about unleashing what's possible by empowering the commercial team. They are leveraging our Gulf Coast franchise and strong service to win. And wrapping up with premium on the intermodal side, we expect growth in domestic intermodal with over the roll conversions. Strong international intermodal volume experienced in 2024 creates tough year-over-year comparisons for us. And the mix issue continues as international volumes remain strong at the start of the year. Additionally, we are keeping a watchful eye on potential tariff changes that could further impact volumes. Even though we are early in the year, we are seeing automotive OEMs curtail production to better manage high inventories. However, consistent with S&P Global's outlook and our conversations with customers, we expect a positive trend with output increasing as the year progresses. Overall, we anticipate a soft economic environment and face difficult comps in 2025, but I'm excited about onboarding LCRA, the new coal customer mentioned earlier, and I'm encouraged by the incremental volume we will gain from new and expanding facilities across multiple business segments. In fact, we currently have over 200 track construction projects in progress with a potential revenue of $1.5 billion, and our business development pipeline is just as strong as it was this time last year. We continue to invest in intermodal, which Eric will touch on. You heard me discuss new unit train facilities added to our network and we are bullish on industrial development projects in the Gulf Coast with a mix of large and small customers. I'm proud of the commercial team. They continue to hustle and we will maintain our strong pricing posture in 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 13. Before diving into our results, I want to express my appreciation to the team for their hard work. Historically, vast surges in volumes such as those we witnessed in 2024 significantly disrupt rail operations. However, the team bucked that trend and was able to improve our service product while also driving growth and network efficiency. It's proof our relentless focus on operational excellence is working and I'm excited we are carrying that momentum into 2025. Safety also improved in 2024 and continues to be at the forefront of everything we do. For the year, both our derailment and personal injury rates improved significantly, a strong step towards becoming the safest railroad. We remain committed as well to enhancing safety as we strive to send every employee home safe each day. Moving to our results this quarter. Freight car velocity improved 1% versus last year. A favorable business mix coupled with continued improvements in terminal dwell drove the performance. Notably, 2024 marked an all-time record for terminal dwell, a meaningful improvement in our service, which reduces customers' fleet costs through improved cycle times. Exceptional work by the team as they continue our focus on the fundamentals to drive terminal fluidity and capacity for future growth. On the service front, our intermodal service performance index declined 7 points year-over-year, while manifest improved 5 points. Intermodal SPI specifically improved month-by-month through the quarter as December ended with our second highest level of the year at 97%. The team continued to deploy buffer resources and adjust trip plans to minimize the impact of the quarter's 26% surge in international intermodal shipments. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 14. Our full year locomotive productivity metric improved 5% versus 2023, while the deployment of buffer resources to handle higher volume levels drove a 3% decline in our fourth quarter results. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees improved 6% in both the fourth quarter and full year versus 2023. Further, 2024 marked a fourth quarter and full year record for workforce productivity. We continue to remove unneeded work and automate operations, while improving the safety of how we work. Train length improved 1% versus 2023, marking our sixth consecutive quarter year-over-year improvement. All in, 2024 set an all-time record for train length. We have made great strides in this area. However, there are still opportunities to adjust the transportation plan and leverage targeted investments as we push to generate mainline capacity in the pursuit of growth. To wrap up, let's review our capital outlook for 2025 on Slide 15. In 2024, we invested approximately $3.4 billion across the railroad as we continue to reduce capital intensity while still delivering value to our shareholders. In 2025, we are targeting capital spending of roughly $3.4 billion, flat versus last year. As always, our first capital dollars will support safe and productive operations as we invest in our infrastructure and renew older assets. This includes modernizing our locomotive fleet and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. Also, we will continue to invest in capacity projects that support our growth initiatives, while enhancing productivity. This includes siting construction and extension projects such as those in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest along our Sunset Route. Furthermore, terminal investments supporting our manifest network such as those in and around our Houston Gulf Coast region aim to improve fluidity and increase capacity. On the intermodal side, we will continue to invest for growth in areas like Kansas City, Inland Empire and Lathrup to name a few. At the end of the day, it's about ensuring we have the right resources in the right place to support growth and drive efficiencies. Wrapping up, I'm encouraged by the progress we made in 2024, but our work is not yet done. Continuing to focus on the fundamentals of railroading and leveraging new innovative technologies, we will further improve our service product and build a more resilient, efficient network in 2025 and beyond. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Jennifer to lay out our initial financial thoughts for 2025. Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric. If you turn to Slide 17, I do want to start by pointing out that in the appendix, we have a modeling slide that contains several 2025 assumptions that should be helpful in framing our current expectations. And as we talk about the year, all of our guidance is within the context of the three year targets we provided at our Investor Day in September. Our team understands those commitments, we are focused on achieving them and our 2025 performance is the first step. As you heard from Kenny, economic indicators for this year are a bit muted and mixed, some growth, some contraction. Add to that outlook, questions around possible tariffs, interest rates, regulatory changes, et cetera and our ability to forecast only gets more challenging. As we see the year ahead, there are positives on the volume front. First, we're starting the year with a bang. Volume is growing and the network is running well. Mother Nature has certainly taken a couple of early shots and will likely fire a couple more, but our resiliency is strong as we focus on meeting our customer commitments. And you heard Kenny talk about how that service product has helped us secure new business for 2025 as well as the continuing pipeline of opportunities that span our entire portfolio. We also acknowledge there are some tough spots, namely from reduced coal demand and the year-over-year international intermodal comparison we'll face in the second half of 2025 as today's mix impact turns into a volume challenge. So while there are puts and takes on the volume side, we are confident that we will continue to drive operational and financial improvement in 2025. We will achieve that goal by continuing to control the controllables by generating pricing dollars that are accretive to our operating ratio, gaining further technology, productivity through technology and by empowering every UP employee to drive asset efficiency. We expect the combination of our activities to drive volume, price and productivity will deliver earnings per share growth for the full year that is consistent with attaining our three year Investor Day CAGR of high single to low double-digit growth. Finally, with the capital allocation, as you heard from Eric, this year, we plan to invest $3.4 billion back into the railroad. We remain committed to our industry leading dividend payout ratio of around 45% of earnings and we plan to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases of $4 billion to $4.5 billion during the year. The team has done an excellent job to position ourselves for whatever environment we face this year. We are on target to achieve our long-term goals while maintaining our industry leading position. We are excited for this new year and we're ready to deliver. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Vena : Thanks, Jennifer. Before we get to your questions and I'm looking forward to the questions, I'd like to summarize what you've heard. First, you heard from Jennifer in the fourth quarter, we leveraged the network to handle volume growth and drive strong quarterly results. Similar to the third quarter, our business mix profile presented a margin headwind. So it was imperative that we generated strong productivity and pricing to offset that impact, and that's exactly what we did. Kenny gave an overview of fourth quarter volumes and laid out initial thoughts for 2025. Look, there are a lot of unknowns, but in my 48 years of railroading, I've never entered a year without some economic question mark. It is what it is. As you heard from Kenny, our team will focus on outperforming our markets and generating strong pricing for the value we provide. Importantly, I believe our 2024 performance demonstrates that our strategy to operate with a buffer and connect more closely to our customers is paying dividends, both in terms of meeting our customer commitments and as a direct result winning new business. Eric provided an update on our progress to improve safety, service and operational excellence. From a safety perspective, we made great strides, but we still have work to do. On the service front, we're showing our customers what's possible while at the same time driving productivity. What's exciting for me is that I know we're not done. There are more opportunities ahead and we have clear line of sight of how we drive further improvements in 2025. Lastly, you heard from Jennifer, our expectations for the upcoming year. Key for me is that we're on target to achieve the long-term guidance that we laid out at the Investor Day in September. We operate the largest, most complex rail network in North America and with it comes challenges and opportunities. The team understands our goal is to deliver what's possible from this franchise. We intend to do that as an industry leader that keeps rates in the bar as we drive value for our shareholders. Let me finish with one of my favorite quotes from a mentor. \"It's the fundamentals stupid, do what you say and commit to it and deliver\". And that's who we are at Union Pacific. And with that, I'll turn it over back to you, Rob, and let's start the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Jim Vena : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just want to start on the guidance. The comment consistent with attaining the long-term CAGR that seems carefully chosen language, just so we're all on the same page, like does that just mean you expect to be in that high single-digit to low double-digit range on earnings this year? And then I just want to understand also, Jennifer, the pricing starting to become accretive to margin, is that -- does that start right away in Q1? I don't know if there's any sort of Q1 color you want to give us. Thank you. Jim Vena : So let me start, Scott, with the question of where we are. We were clear that we had a three year and when we commit, just like I said from my favorite quote from my mentor early, we committed and you never know exactly what's going to happen this year, what are tariffs going to do, what are the regulatory changes that the administration is going to put in. But our goal is, just as we showed in 2024 with the 7% increase that we think that -- that's where we're going to be. We are going to be high single-digit, low double-digit. Now if there's things outside of our control, then we're going to have to work harder. But this is not a change from what we said before and I would expect that every year we deliver high single-digit to low double-digits. That's the win for us. So that's what we committed to and that's what we look forward to delivering. Jennifer, on the accretive piece. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, Scott. So just going back for a second. So fourth quarter, we were accretive. So we actually, I would say, outperformed ourselves a little bit there because we did not think we would achieve that here in 2024, but we did in the fourth quarter. And so I'm not going to parse out the quarters in 2025, but I don't see us taking a step back and we're going to be accretive throughout 2025. Scott Group : Thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Jon. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Eric, in Jennifer's comments at the start, you noted the record workforce productivity also said all in cost per employee of 4% in '25 as you continue to find ways to be more productive. You've done a lot of volume with a lot less resources. Is it still a labor productivity or what are some of the other initiatives you're looking at '25 to kind of maintain or manage that cost inflation? Jim Vena : Yes, thank you for the question, Jon. And let me be clear, there is more opportunity and we're working to capitalize on that. Let's go back to our Investor Day and kind of level set from that perspective. First thing I said at Investor Day was that we focus on productivity because it puts Kenny and the team in the best position to grow in the markets and that's still and will always be true. The second thing that we focused on was our culture, our mindset here at Union Pacific, which is to be perpetually dissatisfied with ourselves when it comes to productivity, to keep pushing to find additional opportunities. So specifically to your question about what are those opportunities, it's going to be some of the same things you've heard in the past and a lot of new things that I'm excited about. The fundamentals, they always stay true. Those are the things in the past that we continue to focus on. The improvements we made in the fourth quarter regarding our recruit rate. Even moving that just a single point has a significant productivity driver for us. The work that we did to reduce our people starts in our yards and locals approximately 2% and 4% respectively in the fourth quarter. That's about the technology we're putting in the yards and being able to be even more productive with it. On the technology front, the work that we do and have continued to do and will continue to do on the automation of our terminals and pushing to reduce dwell. Then when you get outside of the terminals and the transportation side, you mentioned a couple of them and the engineering team as they work to continue to automate inspections, maintenance tasks, distribution of materials. And then of course, you have the whole bucket of purchase services and I see great opportunities in that. And we capitalized on those in 2024, but there's more. When you start to think about the technology we have to automate some of our vans across the system and when you're using hundreds of thousands of van starts per year, a 10% improvement in that is really meaningful for us. So here's the bottom line. There's more than 75 initiatives up against how we think about driving productivity across this company. And I really do mean across the company. It's not just operating. I'm very confident about our plan in '25, and I'm encouraged that we'll be telling you about those results as we go through '25. Jon Chappell : Thanks. Jim Vena : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Stephanie. Operator : Stephanie, perhaps you're on mute. Your line is live for a question. Joe Hafling : Sorry, I was on mute. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the good results. I wanted to talk about, one of the things you've mentioned over the last couple of months has been maybe a reduction in regulatory burden. Maybe consistent with what you talked about on the second question here, what are some sort of specific areas maybe that you've seen additional red tape or what areas do you think you guys could particularly benefit if there is reduced regulatory burden on you guys in particular? I know you guys had mentioned a lot of things on the Investor Day. So if there's any specific examples, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Jim Vena : Well, I think the largest thing is that we've applied for a lot of waivers that would help with the technology that we've implemented to make the railroad more efficient, provide better service to our customers. Those are the things that are out there that we hope with the turning of the page and how regulations are being talked about at the federal level that we get those improvements will allow us to be able to provide better service and of course, be more productive. So those are just to name a few and there's a lot of waivers that we've applied for that are being outstanding for years now that we're looking forward to it. So I could go on here for about 45 minutes on things that the regulation wise, I think would help the industry, make us safer, provide better service and be more productive, but that's a good way to look at it as those waivers that we've applied for over the last number of years. Joe Hafling : Got it. Thank you. Jim Vena : You're welcome. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Brian. How are you this morning? Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, good morning, Jim. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. I'm doing well, thanks. I hope you're as well. I wanted to come back to the -- I guess there's a second Brakeperson rules. Wanted to hear a little bit more about that because you mentioned there was one earlier. So thanks for pointing out. And then also, Jennifer, on the comp per employee for the full year, you're still rolling out, last we heard storing out some of the predictable work schedules for the engineers because I understand there's still some negotiation going on with the conductors for something similar. So maybe can you just give us a little context in terms of the other Brakeperson Agreement, how it's different than the first one? And then how you see those other two factors or agreements, I guess, for the engineers and conductors rolling out for the rest of this year and what you expect in the numbers there? Thank you. Jennifer Hamann : I'll let Eric talk about the Brakeperson Agreement and what that really does. But just as a reminder, we did one in the second quarter of 2023 and now this one here in the fourth quarter, and we actually have one more region that we're working on there. In terms of the rollout of work rest, we continue to rollout on the engineer side and we continue to work with our conductor Smart-TD in terms of coming to an agreement. And that's all really part of the mix as we think about the statement that I made about the all-in 4% comp per employee in 2025. Eric Gehringer : Yes. And Brian, I'll just add to that. If you think about on the engineer side, there's 28 hubs across Union Pacific and 20 of the 28 are already cut over. So we're nearly 75% cut over. Now thinking about the Brakeperson, the way to really think about it is you kind of got to go back in time a little. So go back in the days when you had five people on every single train. And that's the context you got to think about this Brakeperson deal. As the technology has improved over the last 40 years, including the technology that we're still implementing to this day, you just have less demand for some of those five people. And we've demonstrated that, right. At most a crew today has three. That third person is the Brakeperson and we have that in some parts of our railroad. In Jennifer's prepared comments, she referred to it as a regional Brakeperson Agreement and that's because not every single area of the Union Pacific has it. So this is very similar to the first agreement that we reached in almost every single regard and the goal is still the exact same, right. It's to utilize who was in those Brakeperson positions as conductors and our normal crew base to be able to provide the service that we sold to our customers. Jim Vena : The only thing I'd like to add is the whole discussion about where we are on implementing with SMART and with the BLET and Eric just said that 20 out of the 28 hubs we've implemented. What you always, Brian, when you do those things is you make sure that you still end up with the same number of starts per week per employee. And that's real important. And I sat down very first few weeks I was here, came back to work what, 16 months, 17 months ago with the union leaders and they committed that it made sense that that goal had to be there. And what we wanted to do was provide that time off and that scheduling. But they also understand, because they want us to succeed also, is that we have a workforce that works. What -- we expected them to work on a weekly basis. And what we found results so far is we have to work hard to find ways to make sure that the schedules are set up. And we've had a little degradation, but nowhere near as much as some people write about. I'm always surprised when people write about those things without the detail. But at the end of the day, I'm very comfortable that we have figured out a way to move ahead and do this right, so that we don't add incremental cost to the company when we provide and the unions have agreed that it is going to be cost neutral for us or start neutral, wages still went up 4.5%. So the wages are the wages that we've agreed to. But that's the way to look at it is that we're very comfortable. And with SMART, we'll get to the right place that's good for our employees. We want our employees to have regular ships. I'm one of the guys who is a CEO in this industry that's actually worked on the ground as a locomotive engineer and conductor and to have schedules that help you plan your life so that you can balance the demands of working and also everything else, your family and everything else is real important to me. So we'll come to the right place. But we're also being smart about how we get to it. You can't have a deal that's all one sided. So I'm looking-forward to working with SMART to finalize the deal and working with the BLET to implement the last eight terminals that we have. But I think it's a real positive for both of us and it will help us to become even more efficient in the long run because people with schedules will not take as much time off as they did before once they get used to what's -- what their work schedule is. So sorry for the long answer, but I just needed to sort of clarify because I know there's some noise out there about what the effect is for us. Okay? Brian Ossenbeck : Understood. Thank you, Jim. Jim Vena : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, Jim and team, and nice job on the quarter. You briefly touched about some of the unknowns that are out there. There's obviously been a lot of talk about potential tariffs with two of our largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Clearly, you guys have a big position in Mexico with your access to the Mexican interchanges as well as a partial ownership of Ferromex. I guess if we do get that tariff on February 1, sort of what are the expectations on volume and then I guess what potentially could have an impact if cross border business with you guys would decline because of that? Jim Vena : Listen, let me start and then I'm going to pass it over to Kenny, who knows our markets and what the different business mix would be. If something happens South of the border, does it give us more business out of origination in the U.S., I'll leave that to Kenny. But let me talk in general, the way I think about this. I have never, for all the years, I've been railroading and I just about hate to say that number because I think it's -- I've been railroading longer than most people on this call have been alive. But at the end of the day, I have always -- there's always something and this is the way I see it. We have the capability at Union Pacific to react to anything that's thrown at us. Good strong balance sheet, real good focused marketing team operations that's looking to be more efficient. And I look at the entire package, if we get tariffs but we also get the regulatory changes and we get the tax changes that we're talking about by the President with how depreciation is going to work on capital and how our corporate tax rate works that could be a lot of positive. Now I don't expect any of that. That's not what we plan. We plan for the worst if something really bad happens, make sure that we are in a good position to handle that. So I think that with the puts and takes of where our business is, we'll deal with it, and we're waiting to see what actually happens. I'm hoping that it's a negotiating position by the President and because I don't think anybody, the consumers in the U.S. would love to have increase in prices because of dispute unless there's some strategic reason that the President needs to do that for security of the country. But overall, I'm very comfortable that we're going to be in a good position as we move forward and we'll just react on how we see things happening. Kenny? Kenny Rocker : Jim, I'll tell you, you covered a lot. So all I'll say is, and we've seen this before, it's really about being prepared. And what generally happens is maybe the origin location shifts from Asia to Mexico or Canada and that commodity is priced in, that tariff is priced in. But being prepared is a critical thing. Eric and his team have demonstrated that, especially in the second half of this year when we saw it happen on the West Coast. Same is true with exports. We saw that on the grain side where it may shift from P&W or go to the Gulf or go to Mexico, regardless, it's all about preparedness. And I'm telling you, as we're humming along here from an operating and service perspective, I feel good about our posture going in regardless of what happens. Jim Vena : Thank you very much. Good question. Jason Seidl : Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to maybe pick up on the West Coast and get some perspective about how you think about sort of the shifts. I know international intermodal has got some pretty challenging comps, particularly as you move into the second half of the year. But Kenny, any sort of perspective you can give what you're seeing from your customers, maybe how real-time any of those shifts may occur? I know we kind of have a tentative agreement on the East Coast, so potentially there could be some business moving around a little bit. And then just, maybe in terms of the pricing piece, I know we're getting back into sort of accretive pricing. How do we sort of think about the opportunity and pricing as we move forward over the course of the next year or maybe longer in terms of the service recovery in the network, ultimately the inflation that we've seen across the, sort of the broader market outside of transportation and maybe what your opportunity is to try to tap into that? Just want to get a sense of maybe how that plays out. Kenny Rocker : Yes, Chris, on the International intermodal side, we are seeing some pull ahead taking place. And whether it's the hangover from some of the strikes on the East Coast or whether it's just the idea of the tariff, you can see our numbers and they're pretty strong here as we are walking into January. We'll see how that plays out for the rest of the quarter before I can really tell you what will happen. We've got the tough comps and I've talked about that. Those are in the second half. But sitting here on January 23rd, I think it's premature to go out and make a strong forecast about what will happen there. Now, on this whole thing around prices, I just want to reiterate what Jennifer said. We were price accretive in 2024 and we expect to be price accretive in 2025. Eric and the team have really done a great job of providing a strong service product. Our commercial team sells it and we're providing the service that we sold to our customers. I want to hit that hard. We're sharing the investments that we're laying out to support the growth. Our commercial team is crystal clear on what's acceptable going in from a pricing standpoint based on the service that we sold. With that, we're going to take some risk, but it's all about aligning the service we've sold with maximizing price. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Jim Vena : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Ravi. Christyne McGarvey : Hi, great. Thanks for taking -- good morning. This is Christyne McGarvey on for Ravi. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to circle back to some of the service comments. It sounds like you guys have pretty good confidence going into 2025, but I wanted to touch on kind of what's underpinning that? And maybe particularly in the context of perhaps a better environment than you guys are currently thinking about, if the volumes do snap back a little bit more aggressively, how you guys feel that kind of capacity is there to meet that without much service disruptions or customers? Jim Vena : Well, I love the question that says what happens if we have more business? I think I like that question. That would be a great outcome for all of us if the U.S. consumer stays strong and grows the demand for us. We operate a railroad and we keep on talking about buffer and I think we showed it with the large increase in international. And that's the way we look at it. We want to have our assets in place, operating them efficiently, but we carry a buffer, especially the assets that we can't inbound into the company if we need them in a quick manner. So locomotives, railcars, we do that. Capacity on the railroad, we operate our railroad with the capacity because we need to recover from events like we just had in the Southeast part of our network, we need to have a buffer. So we run with a 20% to 25% buffer on our capacity, rail capacity because our business goes up and down. Customers don't release cars seven days a week. There's a big drop in the weekends. So we have that buffer. That's the way we look at it. Listen, the best thing that could happen is a 10% increase in volume across the Board. I think we're set-up to handle that and we'd onboard the people to be able to handle that in a very quick manner. So that would be the best problem I would have in 2025. Thank you very much for the question. Christyne McGarvey : Thanks. Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ariel Rosa with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Ari, good morning. Ariel Rosa : Hi, good morning, Jim, and congrats on a nice results here in fourth quarter. So I wanted to ask about the operating ratio. You mentioned this expectation of industry leading operating ratio. Just wanted to understand a little bit more what gives you confidence in that target? And if you could talk about kind of how you perceive the structural advantages that UP relative to some of your competitors, especially given the context of BN maybe having some challenges in fourth quarter that maybe held up some of their intermodal partners. So if you could just give a little more color on that outlook, both kind of short-term and longer-term, how we should think about that? The OR evolution? Jim Vena : Yes, Ari, I don't -- I'm not going to comment about any other railroad. We have a position that -- it's a complicated network that we have. It truly is. It's not linear, it's complicated. But I think we've fundamentally figured out a way to operate it and be as efficient as possible. We want to be the leaders when it comes to operating ratio and that's what we're delivering. And I'm not sure what the other railroads are going to because we're first up. I'm assuming that we will have the best operating ratio. That's an outcome of everything we do. That's the important piece is Ari. what do we do with -- do we provide good service, so we can maximize price so our customers could win and grow in the marketplace. That's real important for us, that triangle. Is that operationally -- do we look at our assets, how we operate, the number of people and do we use technology? We're excited about net control and how we were going to be able to quickly change our operating plan faster than we've ever been able to do before to operate the railroad more efficiently. So with all those things, I personally, and I've said this publicly and I'll say it again, all the railroads should be very close when it comes to operating ratio. There's no reason for the Class 1s not to be. And I know some -- I'll probably get some notes from some of the other CEOs and I'd appreciate the call or the text. But at the end of the day, we want to be in the best position and you can see what happens when we have a little bit of volume, we price smart, we operate the railroad efficiently, we end up with a 58.0%. Are we always going to be at a 58.0%? No, we might go up a little bit depending on what the market conditions are. But we're going to drive that to be the best and stay tuned, okay. I don't think anybody thought we were going to be able to deliver a 58% and hang on and watch us go. That's the win for us. Anybody else want to comment anything further? No, nobody else wants to say anything after that. Thanks for the question. Ariel Rosa : All right. Thank you, Jim. Jim Vena : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Bascom. Bascome Majors : Good morning, Jim. In one of the earlier questions, you talked about some opportunity with the FRA waiver backlog potentially beginning to clear and opening up some efficiency. But this week, we also had Patrick Fuchs take over as STB, Chairman. Can you talk about that side of the regulatory fence? What have you learned from working with him as a Board member over the last six years? And over the next several years, what opportunities does UP or the industry have that might not have been on the table under Primus or Oberman's leadership? Thank you. Jim Vena : Yes, listen, there's always changes in who leads. And I've had a number of meetings with Mr. Fuchs, okay. Very smart individual. And the rest of the Board is very strong. So at the end of the day, the way I look at it is we have the same goal. We want to provide good service to our customers. And if we can provide good service to our customers, they win in the marketplace and we both win. And the STB deals with those things. Now, at the end of the day, there's a lot of other things that the STB does. They look at mergers, they look at acquisitions. And I'm absolutely sure that everybody, the STB and the railroads would like quick decisions, quicker movement on what's happening. And I'm hoping that that's how we move ahead. But I'm very comfortable that the relationship will be strong and we'll continue to have a strong relationship with all the regulators. There is a position to have regulators there. There is a need and I'm very comfortable that we'll work with them and be very transparent about what we're doing at Union Pacific. Anybody else have any comments on that, any further? Because you've all met with the STB, Kenny? Kenny Rocker : No, I mean, we're looking forward to it as a commercial leader. We want quicker outcomes so that we can service the marketplace. So it's encouraging. Jim Vena : Eric, anything from you? You deal with them lots. Eric Gehringer : I think that's the exact same comment. I mean, even in the engagements that we've had with them on even service things, right, continuing to move faster. I know Patrick in the past has had really good perspective on how we think about service. So looking forward to working with them. Jim Vena : I know, Jennifer, you don't meet with them as often, but maybe we should get you there more often because you've got a better personality for it than me, maybe. But anything to add? Jennifer Hamann : No, I think your point about our goals being aligned is the important one. They want a strong rail franchise. It's the best thing for the nation, our national security, our economy, and we want to grow with our customers. And I think working together to fulfill that purpose is what everybody wants. Jim Vena : Perfect. Great question. Thank you very much. Bascome Majors : Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Hi, great. Good morning, Jim and team. Congrats on the solid OR and results. But maybe digging in a little bit on that. Jen, you guided in the appendix the other expense to $325 million, $350 million. Maybe can you delve into what happened in the fourth quarter? I think you mentioned the bad debt expense. Can you talk about a scale of the one-timer or the scale of casualty expense that we should see bounce back? And I guess maybe I'm just ultimately getting at, kind of, trying to think about the cadence to first quarter. Can you talk about seasonality and what we should -- I know you don't delve into quarterly specific, but maybe just normal historical seasonality, how we should think about the move given the improved performance here in the fourth quarter? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, when we look at other expense for the fourth quarter, I mean, casualty was really the driver there. I did call out the bad debt expense, but the bigger piece was the casualty, both in terms of looking at it year-over-year because we did have a pretty big step-up in fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the fact that we're starting to see some better performance here in 2024. That's a little slower to come through on the expense side, but you heard Eric and Jim both talk about the fact that we're continuing to drive better safety performance. So that's really where I'd focus in terms of the driver for fourth quarter. In terms of looking out into 2025 within that category, it's probably one of the least seasonal categories we have, quite frankly. State and taxes -- state and local taxes is the biggest component of that. And then you do have some of the other things like the casualty, like bad debt, travel, all those fun things. So I wouldn't think about that in terms of a lot of seasonality on that expense line. Ken Hoexter : Well, I didn't mean, just on the expense line, I meant the cadence into first quarter of kind of the OR, do you normally see 150 basis point deterioration? Is that -- would you see that given all the backdrop that you're talking about in a big picture way? Jennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, obviously I'm not going to give you a guide, Ken, for the quarter, but I think in terms of seasonality, you understand it. There is a difference, when you start out the year, you have some beginning of year costs. If you think about some of the payroll taxes that kick back in for us, our business is a railroad. You generally see some of the lowest volumes of the year in the first quarter and then you tend to have some more weather expenses. I mean, I'm not used to paying for snow removal in New Orleans, but I think I'm going to this year a little bit. So you have some of those things happening. So pleased to see the way the railroad started in terms of the volume demand and the fluidity. But from a seasonality perspective, I wouldn't look for anything unusual there. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate the clarification. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Dave. David Vernon : Hi, good morning and thanks for the time. So Kenny, I got a couple of questions for you. First is, in the intermodal business, can you give us a sense for where utilization is in the box pool fleet for you guys right now? Obviously, there's a lot of the channel inventory that's been built up by the intermodal marketing companies through the pandemic taking too many boxes. I'm just wondering where your utilization is kind of running right now on railroad owned equipment? And then the second question would be whether this recent uptick in natural gas prices that we're seeing may have some benefit for you on the pricing side with some of your utility coal contracts? Thanks. Kenny Rocker : Yes. So the first question. Thanks. We certainly did deploy our rail fleet in the second half. We saw it grow and really do really well in our portfolio of fleet. When I say portfolio, I'm talking about the private asset folks, IMCs. So we saw shrink there. It wasn't fully deployed. So there's upside there. And so we'll see what happens as we move throughout the year. Switching to natural gas, I tell you, it's one of the most volatile things to do. And I've been in this role now for seven years and I've gotten out of that game of trying to forecast what's going to happen with natural gas. But bottom line, you asked a direct question. We should see some benefit if natural gas prices increase. Absolutely. David Vernon : And is there any way to quantify how many more boxes kind of are stacked today versus maybe you would have had normally pre-COVID? Kenny Rocker : No, I would just say that if you look at the overall market again, I mean, the overall market is still not where it should be. There's still upside. And so we still feel good about deploying those boxes as the market comes back. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question. David Vernon : All right, thanks for the time. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Jordan. Jordan Alliger : Good morning. Just coming back to intermodal, if the trends hold up that international facing those tough comps, maybe volumes would be tough to grow in the back-half of the year, does the domestic intermodal offset, can that provide -- even if volumes are perhaps down, can that provide a favorable net positive in terms of mix, margin, EBIT dollars, et cetera? Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Yes, I mean everything depends on magnitude, right, Jordan. So I think it's unfair to really kind of focus in on one commodity line like international intermodal. You're right the comps are going to be extremely tough in the back-half, but there's a lot of other businesses that we move and that's really what's going to ultimately play into what our financial results will be. So maybe domestic intermodal offsets some of that, but we've got a lot of other business lines that we're going to move and we're going to try to maximize those. So I don't know that we want to get into the game of trying to make a prediction about how the back half actually looks. There's a lot to happen between now and then. Jim Vena : The bottom line is we feel confident and we're bullish on the domestic intermodal market going into 2025. That's the key. Jennifer Hamann : We've had some great franchise wins there that we still haven't seen the full benefit from. Jim Vena : Thanks for the question, Jordan. Jordan Alliger : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Hi, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up on the volume outlook, if we look on the outlook on Slide 11, on a headline, there's more pluses than minuses. But how should we think about the mix impact on revenue per carload? You just talked about intermodal in the previous question. But I guess any visibility into changes of mix within mix within these categories that we should be aware of when we think about the market share wins? And Jennifer, understanding you don't want to guide each quarter, but how should we think about volume growth through the year given the more difficult back-half compared? Can we grow volume each quarter? Would that be kind of a base case expectation? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Jennifer Hamann : Hi, Daniel, thanks for the question. So, I mean, we specifically aren't giving volume guidance either for full year or on a quarterly basis. I think you've laid out, as we laid out kind of what some of the puts and takes are through the year. I think the important thing is that we're very well positioned. The service product is good. Kenny and his team are out there winning new business. And so we're going to do all we can to push that curve upward. But there's also market forces out there that we're going to be playing against and we'll just see how that all plays out. From a mixed perspective, and I did say this in my comments. When I look to the back-half of the year with what we expect to happen from International intermodal, that will alleviate that mix pressure that we had in the back-half of 2024. How that ultimately shapes out kind of similar to my answer to Jordan, will depend on what the rest of the business is doing at that point in time. But I think you're thinking about the different components correctly. It's just a matter of what else layers in along with those as we go ahead. Certainly, mix will continue to be a challenge here at least in the first part of the year as international intermodal stays strong. I don't know, Kenny, if you want to add anything else? Kenny Rocker : You hit it all, again the credo here for the management team is we're going to have volume outpace the markets and we expect the revenue to outpace volume. Jim Vena : I guess the only thing I would say is this. Our business mix actually is we've got a broad range of customers and a broad range of markets that we play in. So of course, we want to maximize all of them in a smart way that fits our network, makes our customers win, and it's service that we can provide at a high level. So puts and takes international, we don't see it being able to stay at that. Nobody -- if I go back to the early part of 2024, nobody thought the international intermodal for the Western railroads was going to grow in for Union Pacific as much as it did, but it did. But we also have products across, whether it's industrial products, whether it's sand for fracking, you name it. And that's the nice part about our franchise is the different types of customers that we handle. We move every day, products that America needs for finished products, consumer goods and inputs to the economy. So I'm very happy. It's great to have this franchise that was built by a lot of people before I came to Union Pacific. So that's the way we look at it. And of course, Kenny's job is to maximize it. Otherwise, why do you have a marketing department, right? So I'm looking forward to another great year, Kenny. Thank you very much for the question. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Walter. How is it in Canada? Walter Spracklin : Yes. It's pretty cold, but my backyard rink is in good shape, Jim. That mentor quote, it sounds like it was a quote from Hunter, am I right? Jim Vena : Well, it was a little earlier, but I think Hunter would have -- might have said it in a different way. He might have not called me stupid. Walter Spracklin : We're excited about. Jim Vena : But at the end-of-the day, yes, he would have said something very similar. Don't worry about all these things that you can't control. It's the fundamentals. If you operate a strong railroad, if you look at your cost, you make sure you're very efficient, don't lose sight of what's important, you end up on the winning side of the game. You end up on the winning side of the hockey game. You know, Walter, good strong defense, right, in hockey always wins the Stanley Cup. Not that classic person in the front. It's that strong four core defensemen that make a difference and a strong goalie. So that's what we're all about. Walter Spracklin : Well, my son will be happy to hear that comment for sure. Speaking of those fundamentals, Jim, you talked a bit about guidance and its predicate on a mixed economic outlook. And I know you like that kind of scenario analysis where we look at the upside. And I know a few of your trucking peers have spoken pretty constructively here today about that potential for an improvement in the economy. So if we do see that, where do you see the most opportunity for leverage, if we get a better macro? And more importantly, is this type of operating leverage that you're engineering here, Jim. Excuse me, is this setting you up for potentially coming in above the high end of that low double-digit band or is the low double-digit capture? If the economy gets better, then we will do low double-digit. Just curious to hear how that sensitivity works out for you. Jim Vena : Well, Walter, if I didn't have a few hundred people on the call, maybe I would say something different. But bottom line is you know what we talk about. But you know what, you always hear from me. But I've got a strong team with me and Eric does a fantastic job about how we operate every day. And Kenny does a fantastic job. I rib him every so often about why do we need a marketing department. So why don't I let them talk about what they see and what we have operating leverage and what we see customer leverage as we move ahead and what that would mean. So Kenny or Eric? Kenny Rocker : I'll kick off, Eric, and then you take over. I mean, look, we laid out the slide, but I'm very bullish on what we're seeing in our grain products area with renewable diesel and I'm bullish from a number of reasons. One is structural, we've talked about these facilities that are on our line. Eric's service product has given us flexibility on the grain side to move anywhere in the world, whether it's going out of the Gulf, whether it's going to Mexico, whether it's going to the P&W and we'll see where coal ends up. I got a coal question a little bit earlier. It started off pretty solid here and we've got a win that's coming off. On the industrial side, our Petrochem business has been strong, we've had some wins. We've been investing in that area to help us grow. We'll see that in terms of expansions coming on this year. And then we got to look at some of these other macro indicators, what's going to happen with housing starts that has a really, I'll call-it a step function impact on us from a lot of different commodities. And then on the premium side, we should see automotive market improve as we move throughout the year. Domestic intermodal, I mentioned I'm high on and should be positive. And on the international side, I'd be remiss if I didn't say we've gone out and tried to minimize those comps by winning some business last year and trying to retain portions of it, not all of it, obviously. So we'll see how that plays out. Eric Gehringer : And then Walter, if you pick it up from there, then the question becomes, are there proof statements in Union Pacific's recent history that demonstrate that we can do exactly what Kenny just said that we can support him as he's out there in the market and there are a number of them. We talked about international intermodal and I think we've talked about that one enough, a massive accomplishment for the team. But think about it, if we were sitting here a year ago, nobody would have expected the shift on the grain side away from the Pacific Northwest as much into Mexico. But you didn't hear any noise about that. Instead, you saw us pivot, use some of those buffer resources we have, leverage our strong relationship with FXC to be able to grow that market share. You also see it in the example that I mentioned in my prepared comments about the Houston Gulf Coast projects. Sometimes when people think about capital investments and we say projects, they think, well, it's one location and we must be building just a siding. That project collectively is a massive undertaking and it's a very strategic undertaking to say where do we have to make just small adjustments, small investments in many different terminals to make sure that we can support exactly what Kenny said. And then finally, one of the most exciting ones for me and certainly for all of us, I tell you, every single expansion we do at Inland Empire, Kenny's team just keeps filling it up. And so we have many proof statements that say we can support exactly what Kenny is setting out to do in 2025. Walter Spracklin : I appreciate the color, Eric, Kenny. Thanks very much. Jim Vena : Walter, thank you very much. And listen, it's time for one of the Canadian teams to win the Stanley Cup, okay. Walter Spracklin : Agreed. Jim Vena : It's been a long time. Walter Spracklin : Agreed. Jim Vena : And I think the Edmonton Oilers are going to do it. I've been following them for a long time and I've been suffering for many years, Walter. Not as bad as you in Toronto, but that's okay. Don't worry about it. Walter Spracklin : We'll get it done. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kaufman : Thank you very much and congratulations on just a terrific execution quarter. Kenny, I want to come back to you, if I can. I liked your answer to Jason Seidl's question, be prepared in terms of dealing with these known, unknowns. But I want to dive a little bit deeper. When I think about what could be at risk on the tariff side, I'm not talking about the tax change or regulatory benefit. You would think obviously export grain South, you would think beer imports North, you would think auto parts. What elements of your traffic mix either have maybe a Canadian end to it that we might not see as obviously or a Mexican import, export end that might not be as obvious to us on the outside. Kenny Rocker : Well, first of all, I just want to say it's all fluid. And I'm not aware when I look across our commodity groups where, maybe there is one specific commodity I can think about. But most of these commodities have different entry points and different origin points, different destinations. That's why I talk about preparedness, because we have just a great franchise to be able to capture that. So whether it's finished vehicles that have to come in through the Gulf, whether it's finished vehicles that have to come in through Mexico, whether it's finished vehicles that we move out of the P&W, we have different entry points and destination points to move in and out. That's why I harp so much on preparedness. The end consumer is going to consume these products. It may be a few pennies more. They're going to consume the products. It's just how it's going to get there and our commercial team is all over this to make sure it moves Union Pacific. Jeff Kaufman : So maybe to your point, I guess maybe the thing we should be thinking about is maybe the way it gets to where it's going changes, but your feeling is that the team will find a solution if that has to be. Kenny Rocker : So I hit that point. I thought I hit it hard earlier. That's exactly what I'm saying. Our job, our commercial team and we are, and we're dialed-in on where these changes will be and then coming up with solutions with Eric team to make sure we can deliver. Jim Vena : Yes, good morning. I forgot to say that. And thanks for the question. I think you summarized it well. Jeff Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Hi, yes, good morning. I wanted to -- I think you've had some pretty positive and convicted views on pricing and focus on price, which is great. How do you think about the truck, your assumptions on truckload market? And do you just think, well, we'll get a little help from some modest contract increases in truck and that helps us and or how do you think about that? And also just on intermodal revenue per unit, is that something that's been pretty meaningful drag for a while? I know some of that can refuel surcharge and mix and everything, but that's been a pretty big drag. How do you think about revenue per unit in intermodal in 2025 as well? Kenny Rocker : So the last couple of years, we -- I have resisted from going out and forecasting and seeing back-half, back-half, back-half. We want to look at the data points and the market data points will tell you whether you're looking at DAC, whether you're looking at FTR that it should improve as we move throughout the year. Customer sentiment is the same as we're talking to a number of our IMCs and private asset folks. We'll let that market play out, the timing of it. We'll see where that goes, the extent of it, we'll see where that goes. And yes, if that improves, we should see some uptick there based on how we position things in terms of that revenue per box. Jennifer Hamann : Yes. And Tom, I think you really nailed it in terms of what you see as the drivers there. I mean, it's one of those categories where we have mix within mix. We talked at our Analyst Day about how our international intermodal has our lowest revenue per unit of any commodity that we haul. And so when that's growing strong within that group, you see that impact. And of course, fuel coming down is another thing. So both of those are really what you see happening there as well as the tougher competitive environment. Jim Vena : The only thing I could add, Tom, is just on the productivity side of the way we've been able to change the way we operate our lowest revenue movements. And no if, ands or buts, there's a big difference between some products that we move because we don't price the same for every commodity. But at the end of the day we've done a lot of work on terminal dwell, car speed, car velocity, how many boxes we can put on a train to be able to make it more efficient for us so that we handle that difference in the revenue that we make. And Eric's team works every day, every minute on that commodity to see how do we optimize the railroad and the cost structure that we have against the revenue that we make on it. So it's a challenge. But at the end of the day, I think we've done a pretty good job of it and we still love that business. It's good for us and it moves through our whole network. And the more efficient we can get, the better we are on being able to handle more of it in an efficient manner and maybe put a little less pressure on Kenny. Well, I guess not, to price it up. So thanks for the question, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Oliver Holmes with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question. Jim Vena : Good morning, Oliver. Oliver Holmes : Good morning, thanks for having me on. Just a question on CapEx if I may. It looks like your locomotive [technical difficulty] Jim Vena : Oliver, you're breaking up. I can't understand it. I don't know if anybody else around the table can. Jennifer Hamann : No, all I heard was something about CapEx. Jim Vena : Yes, can you maybe just get into a little better spot or something and see if you can get through to us, please. Oliver Holmes : [technical difficulty]. Jim Vena : No, still breaking up, Oliver. Can we go to the next question and then see if we can get Oliver in a different spot because I know we're down to the last couple. Operator? Operator : Sure. Yes. The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Jim Vena : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Oglenski : Hi, good morning all. Thanks for getting my question in here. I know it's been a long call, and I was off for the front part of it. So apologies if I'm replicating something here. But I guess, Jim or Kenny, we've heard about better service and I think what investors are looking for at Union Pacific and other railroads is to finally see real volume growth. So on the back of those service gains that you guys have made in the network, Kenny, within the context of your comments about volume outpacing the market this year, I mean, is this incremental wins? Is it business development efforts that are driving this? And finally, leveraging that service product? Kenny Rocker : Yes, absolutely. I mean, if you look at our network minus the business development wins, especially in markets like the automotive that I highlight, in markets that are challenged where we have structural decline like coal and markets that are emerging and we're ahead of it in renewable diesel in a market that we expect to grow from an export perspective on the Petrochem side and industrial chemical side, absolutely. The business development wins matter and it does help us outpace the market. So no other way to really say that than to just hit that one head on. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you all. Jim Vena : Brandon, thank you very much. Operator, did we get Oliver back on or not? Operator : No, it did not, Mr. Vena, I'll turn it over to you for closing comments. Jim Vena : Okay. Well, listen, Oliver, call in Brad and team are always willing to answer the question, so I apologize if it didn't work out. But listen, I'm very proud of the team. I'm very proud of the focus, I'm proud of every -- today, right now, we have 15,000 people out there moving, touching and working to move the products that we sell. And the rest of us are in a nice warm office and they're out there working. I can't be more appreciative. Great quarter for all of them, great quarter for us and looking forward to speaking to all of you, if not at some conference or at some other time at the end of the first quarter. So thank you very much. Have a great day and let's enjoy the day as we go forward. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Vena, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
