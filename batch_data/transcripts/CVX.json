At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff Gustavson, General Manager for Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $4.5 billion or $2.36 per diluted share. Results are consistent with our earlier guidance, where we highlighted specific negative impacts associated with foreign exchange and selected asset impairments and related charges, which totaled approximately $500 million for the quarter or $0.26 per share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was approximately 13%. Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $8.4 billion during the first quarter. Cash capital expenditures were $8.5 billion. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled $16.2 billon, giving us a net debt position of $6.9 billion. On Slide 5, this week Chevron\u2019s Board of Directors declared a $1.07 per share quarterly common dividend payable in mid-June. This represents an 8% annualized payout increase. Since 2004, we have grown the dividend by a compound annual rate in excess of 10%, which leads the competitor groups. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. We are committed to competitive, consistent and growing shareholder distributions. This demonstrates the importance we placed on balancing long-term investor return objectives, achieved through reinvestment in the business, with near-term return objectives achieved through distributions. It also reflects the strength of our balance sheet, our strong portfolio and our confidence in the cash generation potential of our growth projects. Turning to the next slide. We\u2019ve incorporated two new slides into the presentation this quarter, which provide year-over-year comparisons consistent with our earnings press release. The first, shown on Slide 6, compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2014 earnings were $4.5 billion, approximately $1.7 billion lower than first quarter 2013 results. Adverse foreign exchange movements accounted for $325 million or 20% of the overall decline. You\u2019ll recall that foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with very little cash flow impact. Upstream earnings were down $1.6 billion. In addition to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $225 million, the deterioration reflected lower crude oil production and liquids realizations and higher tax effects, DD&A and exploration expenses. Downstream results were essentially flat. And the other segment reflected the impairment of a mining asset, which resulted in an approximately $265 million absolute impact during the quarter, and was offset to a large degree by lower corporate expenses. Turning to Slide 7. I\u2019ll now compare results for the first quarter of 2014 with the fourth quarter of 2013. First quarter earnings were $418 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $545 million, with adverse foreign exchange movements accounting for two-thirds of this decline. The timing of listings was the second significant contributor to upstream quarter-on-quarter deterioration. Downstream results increased by $320 million with nearly equal improvements noted in the U.S. and the international segments. The current quarter had favorable impacts from lower operating expenses, stronger chemical results and positive foreign exchange movements, all of which more than offset the adverse volume effects of a heavier turnaround schedule. The variance in the other bar largely reflects the impairment of a mining asset, partially offset by lower corporate expenses. Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Jeff? Jeff Gustavson : Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $109 million higher than fourth quarter\u2019s results. Higher realizations increased earnings by $130 million, mainly due to the rise in U.S. natural gas prices. Overall, liquids realizations also rose in large part reflecting crude pricing strength on the West Coast. Lower production volumes, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico reduced earnings by $50 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of year-end LIFO losses and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Turning to Slide 9. International upstream earnings were $654 million lower than last quarter\u2019s results. Realizations decreased earnings by $50 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters. The timing of liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $235 million. Year-to-date, we are approximately 4% undirected, which as you know, should reverse in the coming quarters. Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $190 million, mainly driven by fewer exploration well write-offs and overall lower geological and geophysical expenses across multiple locations. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $355 million. The first quarter had a loss of about $55 million, compared to a gain of $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The tax in other bar reflects unfavorable tax effects, many of which were non-income related. This quarter\u2019s results includes several non-operational items mainly impairments which negatively impacted upstream segment earnings by about $150 million. Adjusting for these effects, our unit earnings for the quarter would have been approximately $20 per barrel. The reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP earnings can be found in the appendix of this slide presentation. The upstream segment was also negatively impacted by FX effects in the timing of liftings, both of which are normally transitory in nature. Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2014 and the fourth quarter 2013. Production increased by 12,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects contributed 21,000 barrels per day, related to higher volumes at Angola LNG and the ramp-up associated with the Papa-Terra field offshore, Brazil. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 12,000 barrels per day driven by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, as well as continued production ramp up from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. The base business in other bar includes the impact of normal field declines and weather-related disruptions, primarily due to extremely low temperatures in Kazakhstan, partially offset by lower production downtime related to several assets. Slide 11 is the second to two new slides incorporated into the presentation this quarter, and compares the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of last year. Production was 57,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources in the Permian and the Marcellus regions in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina increased first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Major capital projects contributed 23,000 barrels per day, driven primarily by production growth from Angola LNG and Papa-Terra in Brazil. Production was impacted by external constraints related to the very cold temperatures in Kazakhstan, as well as lower demand in Thailand, due to a lighting strike which damaged a customer\u2019s gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2013. The base business in other bar includes normal field declines along with other unrelated impacts. Our base decline rate averaged less than 3% between quarters. Turning to Slide 12. U.S. downstream results increased $157 million between quarters. Planned turnarounds at our Richmond, California and Pascagoula, Mississippi refineries lowered volumes and decreased earnings by $85 million compared to last quarter. More than offsetting these volume effects were benefits from lower OpEx worth $95 million and stronger chemicals results worth $80 million. Stronger U.S. chemicals results reflected higher margins for benzene, olefins and polyolefins from our Chevron Phillips Chemical joint-venture. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, primarily higher gains on midstream asset sales, partially offset by modestly lower realized margins, particularly on the West Coast, reflecting weak seasonal demand. Moving to Slide 13. International downstream earnings increased $163 million between quarters. Reduced volumes from turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa refineries decreased earnings by $75 million during the quarter. Stronger Asia R&M margins improved earnings by $70 million. Increased demands drove refining crack spreads higher particularly for low gas and fuel oil. In addition, favorable price lag effects improved marketing margins. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $85 million, about half of which is related to fuel costs. Reduced foreign exchanges losses contributed about $70 million to earnings. The first quarter had a loss of $28 million, compared to a loss of $96 million in the fourth quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including higher chemicals results partially offset by the absence of positive year-end LIFO inventory effects recorded in the fourth quarter. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn it back to Pat. Pat Yarrington : Okay, Jeff. Thanks. Turning to Slide 14. We hosted our security analyst meeting in early March, where we provided a comprehensive update on the company\u2019s performance, projects and future growth prospects. At that time, full information was not available for some of the competitor comparisons. It is available now and the segment return on capital employed updates are shown here. Our upstream return on capital employed for 2013 was just over 17%. We have led the direct peer group for three years. In addition, our returns in 2013 were nearly twice the average returns of the larger E&P group and 3% higher than the very best company in that group. This speaks to the strength of our portfolio and is especially impressive considering our current levels of reinvestment, which we expect will generate peer-leading volume growth going forward. Our downstream return on capital employed turned to lower in 2013, consistent with the rest of the industry. We delivered a 10% return and held the number two rank in the peer group, our sustained position for the last four years. Turning to Slide 15. An updated information on 2013 upstream cash margins. During 2013, with the $38 per barrel cash margins, we were the best in the peer group by over $10 per barrel. We continue to post the highest realizations in the peer group. Our oil weighted portfolio is providing us with a lasting relative advantage. We\u2019re also competitive on operating costs and have made sound investment decisions, both of which support our strong cash margin positions. Over the past four years, the movement in our cash margin relative to the competition has been remarkable, as shown on the chart on the left. While we\u2019ve gained $15 per barrel in cash margin, our peers have gained only $8 on average. Importantly, we expect to maintain or even increase our cash margins going forward. At our analyst meeting, we used a Brent price of $110 per barrel as the basis for our forward cash flow and production projections. We have received a number of questions around the selection of the $110 per barrel price, and I want to be clear that this is not an internal price forecast, but is simply the actual average Brent price over the 2011 to 2013 time period. Using prior year\u2019s actual pricing is the same methodology we have applied for several years now in our analyst presentations. At this historical three-year average Brent price of $110 per barrel, our cash margin is expected to increase to over $40 per barrel later this decade. This is a critical part of our value proposition, as the combination of strong volume growth and an accretive cash margin is expected to drive significant growth in our cash flow from operations over the next several years. Turning to Slide 16. I\u2019d like to provide a brief progress update on some of our major capital projects and other growth opportunities. These are laid out across three growth themes : deepwater, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; LNG, in particular, our two large Australian projects; and shale and tight resource areas, most notably the Permian Basin in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Starting with the deepwater. As noted last month, the Jack/St. Malo platform was moored in a title location earlier this year. We continued installation and commissioning activities including final testing of flowlines and export lines. The project is on-budget and is on-track for late startup in the fourth quarter of this year. For Tubular Bells, which is operated by Hess, hook-up and commissioning is nearly 40% complete and startup is expected before year-end. We also made significant progress at Big Foot during March. The oil export pipeline has been installed and we are preparing to let the drilling module to the top sides later this month. We expect startup to occur mid-2015. Moving onto our LNG project. We continue to make excellent progress at Gorgon, which is now, through April, 80% complete. The final two gas turbine generators have been installed and additional progress has been made on the LNG tanks, jetty and other related infrastructure on the island. All major 2014 milestones are on track and we expect plant startup and first gas in mid-2015. For Wheatstone, we are now at 33% complete. Progress continues to be made at the plant site on the Wheatstone platform and with the offshore development drilling campaign. Wheatstone remains on track to startup in late 2016. Gorgon and Wheatstone are critical contributors to our future growth plans and we are pleased with the study progress being made on both of these projects. As in prior quarters, we have posted updated photos of both projects on our investor website. I encourage you to take a look. We also continued to make progress on our shale and tight resource developments, which nicely complement our large major capital projects. We have an active drilling and development program in the Permian Basin and we have drilled over 120 wells so far this year. We continue to focus on capital and execution efficiency, as well as the identification of sweet spots throughout our extensive acreage position in both the Midland and Delaware sub basins. We are also making steady progress in the Vaca Muerta Share in Argentina, progressing this year\u2019s development program, and we recently signed additional agreements for incremental explorations acreage in the play. On Slide 17, I also like to touch on additional progress made elsewhere. We reached final investment decision and received approval from the U.K. government to proceed with the development of the Alder Field in the Central North Sea. We achieved first projections in the Chirag Oil Project in Azerbaijan and acquired new exploration acreage in Myanmar. In the downstream, we achieved mechanical completions of our new base oil facility at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. Once fully ramped up, this increases our capacity and premium base oil by over 70%, making Chevron the largest premium base oil producer in the world. In addition, Chevron Phillips Chemical 1-Hexene project as well as Oronite Singapore Expansion project recently achieved mechanical completions. Lastly, CPChem started construction on its new Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project, which capitalizes on advanced feedstock source from shale gas in North America. This project is expected to startup in 2017. Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. We\u2019re now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up if necessary. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, I\u2019d ask that you open up the lines for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Hi, good morning. Pat Yarrington : Hi Evan. Evan Calio : Pat, thanks for the comments on the impairment, as it clearly affects a clean comparison of your quarterly upstream profitability. I missed it. I know you\u2019ve identified $400 million to $500 million of upstream impairments in your reconciliation. I see $150 million. And I thought I heard you mention $265 million. Can you just talk me through those numbers once again please? Pat Yarrington : Sure. The interim update we\u2019ve talked about a total of $400 million to $500 million in additional negative charges. And that included foreign exchange and impairments, but we did reference strongly in that total the mining component. That mining component is $265 million. Evan Calio : Okay. Pat Yarrington : And then in the appendix slide that you\u2019ll see, there is also $150 million worth of upstream-related impairments in the international segment. Evan Calio : I see, I got you on the total. Thanks. And I guess my second question, just your net debt increased. It was at $3.2 billion in the quarter, smaller capital increase. I mean I know you intent to bridge to 2015 and beyond when productive capital begins to drop and cash flow from new projects commences. Where do you see the debt limit? Is it at AA level, at the mid 20s, and then what type of commodity price cushion do you forecast in crossing that bridge and maintaining current shareholder distributions? Thanks. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Evan, I think you referenced several questions there and we had a couple of really important words in there. One you talked about bridging. That is an important concept for us. Our free cash flow was essentially neutral in this particular quarter. And you\u2019re right, so net debt did increase and that reference that\u2019s related to distribution to shareholders. We\u2019re very comfortable with that pattern. It\u2019s a pattern that we\u2019ve had for the last few quarters. It\u2019s the pattern that we could see continuing on here in 2014, and then when we get into 2015 and you begin to see these volumes pick-up and the cash flows pick-up, then we get into a different state. We do want to maintain the AA credit rating. We have a lot of room between where our debt level is today at 13% and what would be necessary to even call that into jeopardy. And by a lot, I mean several billion dollars worth of additional borrowing capacity. We do test our own plan against a low priced environment. And I can tell you that against the low price environment, even continuing on with the capital program that we have, we are very comfortable with the distributions that we\u2019re making, even in a low priced environment and maintaining the AA. Evan Calio : Can you just share what that low price means? Pat Yarrington : No, we don\u2019t want to go that far. Don\u2019t want to go that far. So we do look at the overall capital position and financial position of the firm. We test it against the oil prices and we feel comfortable and look where we are. The other thing I would mention is that we do have \u2013 you\u2019ll recall from the March presentation, we are anticipating assets of proceeds of $10 billion over the next three years. Evan Calio : Right. I appreciate. Thanks for taking my questions Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Ed Westlake : Yes, good morning, and thanks for the extra disclosures in the presentation. Just a question on cash flow, I mean I think capital you said that $8 billion. It\u2019s been running higher than that and volume is flattish in the macro environment and you\u2019ve shouted out under-lifts and some extra tax but where there any other things that may have contributed to a slightly lower cash flow this quarter? Pat Yarrington : Nothing of any substantial nature. It was not \u2013 I mean with the under-lifting circumstance, it is not a particularly strong U.S. downstream quarter. So I think there are some operational factors that really lead to the $8 billion cap generation, $8.4 billion. Ed Westlake : Good. Thanks very much. And then Gorgon, you\u2019ve said 80% complete. You\u2019ve obviously just had the Analyst Day and said mid-2015, other people \u2013 perhaps even partners are saying perhaps more later in the year, sort of 2016. I don\u2019t want to get into a debate that, he said, she said, but what\u2019s the critical path that you think in terms of getting Gorgon up mid-2015? What are the risks that you\u2019re now worried about as you get further into the final stages here? Pat Yarrington : I think we have 20 of the 21 critical process modules for Train 1 and the infrastructure, the common facilities infrastructure on the island. The remaining train is due shortly, will arrive shortly. So it really becomes a process of the hook-up and commissioning. And I think that is \u2013 we\u2019ve just come through kind of weather period. So we\u2019re moving into good weather. And so I think weather continues to be a risk. And I think labor productivity continues to be a risk, but both of those, I mean those are aspects of this project that we have been managing now for 4.5, five years. And so those are clearly on everybody\u2019s minds at in terms of managing through this. And I want to reiterate that the project is on track. We\u2019re aiming for and targeting that mid-2015 startup. Ed Westlake : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning, Jeff and Pat. If I could, kind of a big one and the small one. The big one is, you have an interesting number, Pat, which is on productive capital. Could you update us on that number and talk a little bit about how you calculate the number so that we can perhaps use it to compare with other companies? And the follow-up is on Vaca Muerta and I\u2019ll ask you that due course. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Well, basically we just look at \u2013 it really is just assets under construction, I mean definitionally. It\u2019s assets in our work in progress account as a percentage of our total capital employed. And the information that we provided back in March suggested that we\u2019re at pretty high level, predominantly because of the LNG projects that we have underway, as well as the couple of Gulf of Mexico deepwater projects. And we indicated that we saw that stepping down significantly over the next three year period of time. And I also said verbally that we saw pretty important stair steps going from 2013 to 2014 and again to \u201815 and \u201816. We didn\u2019t give actual numbers, I don\u2019t really want to do that, but that pattern that was on our slide back in March is still one that we hold to. So as you see these projects come online, they move out of that WIP account, that work-in-progress account into a producing asset account. Paul Sankey : My other question was that there was an actual numbers on productive capital. And I guess if you could update us on capital employed or at least the last available number? Pat Yarrington : Well, year-end capital employed was about $171 billion. And what we \u2013 right, so the information we gave in the slide was a three-year average there. Paul Sankey : Okay. And what was the unproductive number? Jeff Gustavson : So Paul, the three-year average \u201811 to \u201813 was in the low 40% range. Pat Yarrington : Right. Jeff Gustavson : Moving down to the mid 30s range for \u201814 to \u201816, but that\u2019s the average \u201814 through \u201816, steps down each of those \u2013 in each of those years our historic average here maybe the high 20s. Paul Sankey : Yes, that\u2019s right. So it was percentages around corner [ph]. Pat Yarrington : It was percentages. And we use the averages and you should \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say that 2011 was the lowest of the three years. 2012 was the middle of the three years and 2013 was the highest of the three years, but the three-year average there was at low 40s. And then what we\u2019re saying is \u201814, \u201815 and \u201816 will reverse that pattern. Paul Sankey : Yes, understood. Okay. That\u2019s helpful on that calculation. And then if I can, can you do a little bit more to strip out Argentina. You\u2019ve kind of bundled it with Permian. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Paul Sankey : And you plan to wish that still acquisition growth as opposed to organic growth? Thank you. Pat Yarrington : Yes. Well, so I think that in terms of the Vaca Muerta play itself, we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. Our plan is to drill about 140 wells. This year we\u2019ve got about 17, 18 or 19 rigs drilling at this particular point in time in production there. On a growth basis is about 17,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re encouraged by the well we\u2019ve built, both on cost and productivity, but there is still \u2013 its early days. There is still a long way to go but we\u2019re encouraged so far. Paul Sankey : Okay. I think I\u2019ll take it offline on rig count in terms of volumes year-over-year. You\u2019re just obviously saying that on the variance you\u2019d bundled Vaca with Permian. Pat Yarrington : I see. I misunderstood the question. Paul Sankey : No, thanks for the answer. Absolutely, that was just the follow-up really. Jeff Gustavson : So year-over-year, Paul, we haven\u2019t booked production in the first quarter of last year. We started booking production in the fourth quarter. So there is a contribution fourth quarter to first quarter but over quarters. I mean it is acquisition related, but if you want to talk more specifically about it just talk me offline. Paul Sankey : Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff and Pat. I\u2019ve got also the one big and one small one, if that\u2019s okay. On the impairments part, is that the reason for the high DD&A number, and if so, can you give us an idea of what the run rate should be? Pat Yarrington : It certainly is a contributor to the high DD&A rate. Absolutely that\u2019s a factor. And in terms of general DD&A, I think that it\u2019s fair to say that overall quarter DD&A is going to go forward, move up. Our expectation would be they would move up in 2014 relative to 2013. And we think opportunities in acre bell [ph] rising for the next couple of years, but then flattening out overtime. The patterns on both the absolute and the per barrel is something that you would absolutely expect because of recent investments and our future investments that obviously is also impacted by reserve ad timing and the mix of our projects etcetera. PPC or pre-productive capital as we talked about is going to come down. So I think the thing you\u2019ve got to keep in mind here too is that for these investments, there is evidencing itself and will evidence itself in our DD&A rate. We are giving the investments audience to the largest growth rate of the peer group. A 20% growth rate in volumes between now and 2017. So a significant investment, so generating significant volume growth. Doug Leggate : Thanks. But I\u2019ll take the specifics on DD&A offline with Jeff if that\u2019s okay. My follow-up is really your last point, because I think the growth and the cash margins really actually fairly well understood. What simply we\u2019ve observed over the years is that not really gets paid by the market when it\u2019s accompanied by strong debt adjusted tools if you like, so the balance sheet is not expanding at the same time. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, when you look at your \u2013 you say you\u2019re absorbing the best 20% growth, how do you think about the trade-off that\u2019s $10 billion annual run rate on the balance sheet? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : So I mean I guess I think that if you\u2019ve got the project queue, a slowing project queue and you\u2019ve got a balance sheet that allows you to invest for that. And we do have a balance sheet. In fact you could really argue that for years we were under-levered relative to what might be optimal. So if you\u2019ve got this strong project queue and if you\u2019ve got the balance sheet to support it and the projects are value-accreting for the organization, for the firm, then I think that\u2019s exactly the kind of investment profile you ought to be undertaking. Doug Leggate : All right. I appreciate your answers. Thanks Pat. Pat Yarrington : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Cheng : Hi guys. Good morning. Pat Yarrington : Hi Paul. Paul Cheng : I don\u2019t know whether you want to answer that. I think a lot of people are asking that for CPC your joint-venture, strategically is there any particular reason you need to owning that so that you can have synergy with your other operations, if not, if you look it as a financial investment, does it makes sense for you to only minority interest and put it up as a publicly traded entity together with your partner Phillips 66 and putting into the market so that you can recognize a much higher value given right now that you\u2019re trading at higher multiple than say both your partner and yourself? Pat Yarrington : Yes, so I understand the question there. And I\u2019ll just start back with, when we put the two companies together, we had too I guess I would say sort of the meddling performing chemical companies, if we put them together. And it\u2019s been a wonderful marriage. The partners are very much aligned on how to run this business, where you extract value from this business. And so it\u2019s a joint-venture that has worked very well and has been very successful, so we\u2019re very pleased. So, there no catalysts that\u2019s out there necessarily to say that we need to be doing something different. It is the part of the portfolio that has growth opportunities available to it. And we appreciate that, with this change in the U.S. gas production and advantaged feedstock opportunities here. I think CPChem calls on the technical expertise of both of its parent company and we\u2019re able to and happy to assist them in that capacity. We think it fits nicely in our portfolio. It has \u2013 the chemical business is highly, highly cyclical, more so than our portfolio. And so we\u2019re able to withstand the adjustments that are there, we think that\u2019s an advantage as well. So we are really seeing that there is huge catalyst for us to do something different. And it\u2019s not always clear that the PE multiples in these petrochemical commodity companies are always trading at multiples better than ours. So we like the joint-venture. We think it\u2019s well run. We\u2019re happy to assist and its growth projects and providing expertise and technical capability where we can. We\u2019re very satisfied with it, and I dare to say that our joint-venture partner will be feeling much the same. Paul Cheng : Okay, very good. Second question, can you give us a quick update where the Angola LNG going out, I just wondering you had 50% capacity. And also in the Permian with the 25 rigs, do you have a number that how many of them is currently running in the conventional and whether [indiscernible] already? Thank you. Pat Yarrington : Okay, let me start with Angola and then you might to help me again on the second question. So on Angola, we did have recently a technical issue pop-up. We had a piping failure, which did result in an unplanned interruption to production. There was no fire. There were no injuries. It was a pretty localized damage. It was associated with the flare system. We are doing a root cause investigation and in fact that root cause analysis should be completed within a few days here is my understanding. So the plant is currently shutdown and we\u2019ll need to take a look at that root cause analysis to understand what the go-forward operating plan looks like. That failure occurred sort of mid-April, early April, and it therefore was not an impact in the first quarter results. Paul Cheng : Permian, the 25 rigs. How many of them is in unconventional drilling and of which how many of them is in the pad drilling already? Pat Yarrington : Okay. So all of the 25 rigs in the Permian right now are in the unconventional. We have only one rig drilling in the conventional. And I think you\u2019re asking about pad drilling? Paul Cheng : Yes, correct. Pat Yarrington : I don\u2019t have information on that specific at this point, Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question please. Iain Reid : Yes. Hi guys. Thanks very much. Sorry about this, but can I get back to the impairments and asset divestments you put in the reconciliation back. Because I didn\u2019t understanding some of the stuff you talked about earlier. You got $150 million of E&P impairments. It looks like in the first quarter, and also $100 million gain on dispositions. I think you also got this mining write-down as well. If you just put those together for me again? Pat Yarrington : Sure. So let\u2019s start with the biggest element, which is the mining element. We have a molybdenum mine in New Mexico. And the impairment charges that we talked about there and other related charges that I talked to at the very beginning, the $265 million relates to that. That asset from a segmented reporting basis is in our other segment. In upstream, we noted a $150 million of impairments. It\u2019s in the international sector for us. So these are assets where we feel there is better opportunity in other portfolios basically. And then the third element that was noted there was a asset sale gain. This was in our \u201cmidstream sector\u201d. It\u2019s really pipeline-related and that showed up in the downstream external segment. Iain Reid : Okay. Thanks very much. And secondly was, is it possible to update us on when we\u2019re likely to see the Tengiz hit [ph] to FID? Pat Yarrington : Our targets for this year \u2013 our target is to have that towards the end of the year. I don\u2019t really have any additional information at this point. We were successful in getting the MoU signed back in the later part of last year, which really is a stage setting document to get all the partners aligned on the go-forward process. And so, we\u2019re in the process now of going through and working the cost estimates etcetera, etcetera. So all I can say is towards the end of this year. Iain Reid : And we should expect a kind of overall CapEx \u2013 growth CapEx for this project, and along the line just some of your major things you\u2019re doing in Australia. Is that correct, or is that kind of ballpark, right sort of number? Pat Yarrington : Well, I\u2019m sorry. So I\u2019m sorry, TCO is Kazakhstan, right. I guess one last thing there on TCO. The FID is not kind of critical path. What was the question on Atyrau, I didn\u2019t quite understand? Iain Reid : Sorry, I just want to get an overall ballpark on Atyrau, what the overall cost estimate of the future growth project is going to be? Is it in the same ballpark as what you\u2019re doing in Australia? Pat Yarrington : I see, Iain. We don\u2019t have an updated \u2013 we don\u2019t have a cost estimate until we go to FID. So that will be later and attached to the FID timings. Iain Reid : All right. Thanks Pat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question please. Faisel Khan : Thanks, good morning. First question on Jack/St. Malo. You said that it was moored on location. I just want to understand a little bit, how much sort of wiggle room do you guys have from now to the startup to get that project going, and if there is an active hurricane season, have you built in that sort of weather into the startup and end of the year for that project? Pat Yarrington : Well, it\u2019s my understanding that when we\u2019re putting these facilities out in the Gulf of Mexico, we do as much weather proofing as we possibly can. Obviously, when you\u2019re investing at the size of these facilities, that\u2019s an important consideration. So clearly having it moored is an important step. And so our expectation is that we would be able to handle any weather complications that might arise. Faisel Khan : Okay, fair enough. Jeff Gustavson : Can I just to add, Faisel too. Faisel Khan : Yes. Jeff Gustavson : If there are hurricanes, you have to demobilize. If the folks that are working on it, that could slow things down a little bit, but we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s hard to estimate what\u2019s going to happen there. Faisel Khan : I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand if you guys have sort of incorporated that into your guidance of the startup? Pat Yarrington : In a general sense from a planning standpoint, we always do factor in Gulf of Mexico weather activities to a degree, right. But each year is a difference degree, you know what I mean. Faisel Khan : Sure. Pat Yarrington : So there is obviously a base load that we include in our plans, yes. Faisel Khan : Okay. That\u2019s fair. I understand. And then just on the under-lift, you guys talked about the sequential quarter-over-quarter charge of $235 million. Is that also fair to say that that\u2019s the absolute number too? Jeff Gustavson : So I\u2019ll give you the absolute for the quarter is about $100 million, about half of that. So the rest of that is swing between the two quarters, Faisel. Faisel Khan : Okay, got you. Thanks. I appreciate the detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking my questions. You\u2019re obviously talking a lot more proactively about the Permian, presumably you\u2019d like to get more value for that asset. Have you considered any kind of financial engineering solution that might unlock that value, more so than simply as one piece of your U.S. portfolio? Pat Yarrington : Well, we think we actually try for sitting in, kind of in the catbird seat in terms of the acreage position that we\u2019ve got, the long standing acreage position we\u2019ve got, the royalty advantage that we have there. We have done joint-ventures, of a kind of \u2013 with for example, Cimarex, where we have partnered with similarly situated partners. And those kinds of things you could see us continuing to do on a go-forward basis. If you get commonality of infrastructure and location and you can get efficiencies of drilling where that you\u2019re fracking can really go from our property to their property. So we will continue to look for those opportunities for synergies. We\u2019ve got a very active program scheduled for this year. It\u2019s over 500 wells. And 25 rigs, we\u2019ve done 120 drilling so far. So the activity level is at or perhaps little bit better than planned at this point. So we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities like that, but we\u2019re proceeding had on our own as well. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. And just quickly, can I get an update on the exploration program in Liberia? I haven\u2019t heard about that in a while. Pat Yarrington : Yes, we\u2019re not in a position to say anything more at this point. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Fair enough, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Your question please. Guy Baber : Thank you all for taking my question. My first one was on the 2014 production guidance, but understanding it\u2019s still very early in the year, just wanted to get a sense of how confident you guys are in the guidance right now, just considering some of the weather influence that you\u2019ve got in 1Q, the unplanned downtime at Angola LNG, and in 2Q and 3Q typically being heavier maintenance course. Just wanted to better understand how you guys are feeling about that internally and any cushion you might built-in into the guidance? Pat Yarrington : Okay. That\u2019s a good question. I guess I would just start by saying the year is young. We\u2019ve only had four months or three months in here. There have been some positive. Jeff mentioned a figure about base business declines being at the 3% or little bit less than 3% level. So that\u2019s a very good positive. One thing we haven\u2019t mentioned of a positive nature is at Frade, we now have 10 producing wells on and we continue to make progress to bring on additional wells there. We talked about the Permian ramp ups and the Vaca Muerta ramp ups that are occurring. So those are all working in our favor. Clearly weather has been a negative for us in the first quarter. On an absolute basis, we would estimate that that was worth 20,000 barrels a day or so absolutely negative in the quarter. I mentioned the A-LNG operational issues that we have there. So you put those altogether, you got some pluses, you got some minuses. And the back-end of the year, we\u2019ve got Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo, both of which are scheduled to come online, so our production ramp ups are kind of back-end loaded. And both of those projects are on track. So the best I can say is, and I\u2019ll go back and say, we built-in weather contingencies in our Gulf of Mexico plan in particular, for a base load amount. I\u2019ll just go back and say the year is young. We\u2019ve got positive and negatives out there. We feel that the guidance that we gave, the $26.10 is the best guidance that we have at this particular point in time. And as we do every year on the second quarter, we\u2019ll update you with how things look at that point in time. Guy Baber : Okay, great. Thanks for that. That was very helpful. And then my follow-up was on, one of your three primary growth themes of deepwater. And I\u2019m more focused on your next generation of projects looking beyond the near-term startups that you have lined up, if we start thinking about look at your reserve additions and then longer term growth potential, but you all have a number of potential FID this year, which you have an interest in, I think Stampede and then you\u2019re Indonesia development at Bangka, and then you\u2019re also reevaluating Rosebank. So understanding that every project is unique, how would provide some more commentary on just how conducive the overall environment right now is to pushing forward deepwater FIDs just in line of your view of the cost environment and the evolution of project economics and what you might see as opportunity for cost savings. Just given what\u2019s generally appears to be a more disciplined approach to screening these projects for you all and with some of your peers? Pat Yarrington : Okay. Well, I think I would say if I step back and look at deepwater, I think for Chevron portfolio you mentioned a number of projects, but I think the most strategic basin continues to be the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. And we\u2019ve got number of wells drilling now and we\u2019ll have additional wells drilling over the next 12 to 18 months, a significant number of them, six wells in the next 12 to eight months. So that continues to be an area of strategic focus. And we think we\u2019re competitive there on facility structure as well as drilling costs, completion costs. So that\u2019s important area for us. If I look at IDD. IDD is a complex project. It\u2019s multiple fields. And right now we\u2019re in a position of waiting for government approvals. And then on Rosebank, we did really with the operator kind of put that \u2013 as the operator put that into a recycle mode, because the cost that had come through we\u2019re really didn\u2019t make it compete for capital within our portfolio. So that\u2019s somewhat in a recycle mode. So I think the overall impression that you have about the industry stepping back and taking a look at the cost run up for some of these resource place relative to the value capture, I think some of that is being reassessed as you indicate, Rosebank is a good example of that. Guy Baber : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes, good morning. Pat Yarrington : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : I guess to come back to the Permian a little bit, if I understood correctly, you were not or have not to this point drilled any horizontal wells in the Midland Basin. Was that accurate? Pat Yarrington : We are looking to spud the first one later on this year. Roger Read : Okay. So thinking about how production from the horizontal wells is typically been a little more, let\u2019s say higher IP rates so that. We should think about the shale and tight production accelerating, I don\u2019t know, call a Q4 certainly into \u201815. Would that be consistent with how you\u2019re looking at things? Pat Yarrington : So I think it would be fair to say that if you go forward and you look at quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter improvement, we would be looking to see improvements kind of quarter-after-quarter. Our real focus has been on getting capital efficiency, maximize and getting a strong execution of business being well. So it\u2019s really been on optimizing the value creation. And so we\u2019ve been spending time to understand where the best areas are. And what the most efficient rigs had and overall development plan is. Frankly, a lot of the other producers there have been allowing us to de-risk did play by the work that they have done and that\u2019s in a sense advantageous to us. And we think we can get overtime the same kind of synergies and efficiencies that the smaller operators have. And one of the slides that we have put out in the security analyst meeting gave a good indication of what we see as year-on-year net production increases in the Permian Basin. And at the pretty significant growth rate, we also talk to essentially doubling of our rig count over the next several years from where it is currently. Roger Read : All right. Well, I guess we now have a couple of quarters here where you\u2019re breaking out shale and tight from everything else, so start to get a feel for what the quarter-over-quarter year-over-year performance is. Pat Yarrington : Exactly. Roger Read : So just want to make sure I was understanding the way it should progress here. Pat Yarrington : Right. And we\u2019re hopeful for quarter-on-quarter improvement going forward. Roger Read : Good. I guess my follow-up question, the Angola LNG obviously going to be offline in terms of volume contribution in the second quarter for some significant period of time, but if you think about \u2013 and I know, sometimes you don\u2019t get too granular, but the impact on it from a cash flow standpoint. I mean was this operation given the troubles it\u2019s had so far actually contributing much or should we think about it as mostly a production impact but not a problem for cash flows as we look in the next couple of quarters? Pat Yarrington : Yes, I think you will see \u2013 it will be more noticeable clearly in the production side than the cash flow side clearly. And I don\u2019t have \u2013 as I mentioned, we need to have the root cause analysis done before we have an indication of when \u2013 what that repair and maintenance \u2013 repair activity will look like, and how long that will take and then when we might get back to a producing mode. Roger Read : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Pat Yarrington for any further remarks. Pat Yarrington : All right. Thank you, Jonathan. I guess we got through everybody\u2019s question. So I appreciate your time and interest today. I especially want to thank all the analysts on behalf of all the participants for the questions that they asked in this morning\u2019s session. So Jonathan, I\u2019ll turn it back to you and thank everybody. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Chevron\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Pat Yarrington : Hey good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide two. Turning to Slide three, the company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.98 per diluted share. On a year-to-day basis, earnings were $10.2 million or $5.34 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's earnings were gains on asset sales of approximately $750 million and foreign exchange losses of $232 million, which together equate to a positive $0.27 per share. Year-to-day earnings after netting gains, impairments and foreign exchange impacts was $10.1 million or $5.29 per share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 12%. This reflects both the strength of our underlying producing assets and the fact that we are in the midst of a heavy construction period for a few key capital projects. Our debt ratio at the end of June was approximately 13% similar to last quarter. Our financial priorities are unchanged and we continue to reward shareholders with competitive distribution. We repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the second quarter and in the third quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount. Finally, Chevron\u2019s five-year total shareholder return at the end of the quarter was 18.4%, which continued to lead the peer group and also was in line with the S&P500 over the same time period. Turning to Slide four cash generated from operations was $7.9 billion during the second quarter and $16.3 billion year-to-date. Cash, capital expenditures were $8.9 billion during the quarter and $17.5 billion year-to-date. At the quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $14 billion giving us a net debt position of $9 billion. Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2014 earnings were $300 million higher than second quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange negative affected earnings by $232 million during the quarter representing a negative swing of over a $0.5 million between periods. As a reminder foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effect with minimal cash flow impact. Upstream earnings increased by $315 million. Gains on assets transaction of approximately $610 million in absolute terms and higher realization were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher exploration, DD&A and operating expenses. Downstream results decreased by $45 million. Higher U.S. refining, marketing and chemical earnings were offset by lower international refined product margins along with adverse foreign exchange effects. Movement in the other segment reflects an absence of a 2013 second quarter impairment and lower corporate expenses largely offset by higher corporate tax charges. Turning to Slide six, I\u2019ll now compare results for the second quarter of 2014 with the first quarter of 2014. Second quarter earnings were approximately $1.2 million higher than first quarter results. Upstream earnings were up $957 million reflecting gains on asset transactions, higher lifting, modestly strong realization and favorable tax effects. Partially offsetting were higher exploration and operating expenses in addition to an unfavorable foreign exchange movement between quarters. Downstream results were essentially flat. The variants in the other bar largely reflects the absence of the impairment and related charges for our mining asset from the prior quarter, partially offset by higher corporate expenses. Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Jeff Gustavson : Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $142 million higher than first quarter's results. Higher production volumes at the Perdido and Caesar Tonga Fields in the Gulf of Mexico in the Midland and Delaware Basin and the Permian and in San Joaquin Valley increased earnings by $115 million.` Higher exploration expenses mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $95 million. The second quarter included gains on several separate assets transactions worth approximately $180 million in total. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower natural gas realization and higher operating expenses. Turning to Slide eight, international upstream earnings were $815 million higher than last quarter's results. Higher realizations and higher liftings increased earnings by $280 million. Our under-lifted position in the first quarter was essentially neutralized. Gains on the sale of our interest in Chad and Cameroon increased earnings by $430 million. Lower impairments compared to the prior quarter resulted in an earnings increase of $140 million. An unfavorable movement in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $95 million. The second quarter had a loss of about $150 million compared to a loss of about $55 million in the first quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including favorable tax effects, offset by higher operating and exploration expenses. Slide 9 summarizes the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2014 and the first quarter 2014. Production decreased by 43,000 barrels per day between quarters. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 6,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basin in the Permian. We are also seeing continued growth from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Major capital projects decreased volumes by 13,000 barrels per day due to the shutdown of the LNG plant in Angola partially offset by the ramp up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and Caesar Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico. Plan turnarounds in Kazakhstan, Australia and in Denmark among others reduced production by 57,000 barrels per day. Absence of first quarter external constrains largely weather related disruptions in Kazakhstan as well as lower demand in Thailand, increased volumes by 27,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar reflects normal field declines. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2014 and the second quarter 2013. Production was 37,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our Shale and tight resources primarily driven by the Permian in the U.S. and Vaca Muerta in Argentina increased production by 33,000 barrels per day. Major capital projects contributed 13,000 barrels per day driven by Usan in Nigeria and Papa-Terra in Brazil partially offset by the shutdown of the LNG plant in Angola. Higher turnaround activity mainly in Kazakhstan reduced production by 21,000 barrels per day. Lower production in titanium effects due to lower cost recovery, higher prices and higher royalties reduced production by 37,000 barrels per day. The base business and other bar principally reflects normal field declines. Turning to Slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $95 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased earnings by $140 million driven by tighter product supply due in part to industry refinery maintenance combined with higher seasonal demand, higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $130 million. About half of this was due to higher cost related to shutdown and maintenance activities at the El Segundo Refinery during the quarter. The turnaround was completed at the end of June and refinery operations have returned to normal. The remainder reflects higher maintenance and repair expenses at our other refineries and incremental costs from the startup of the Pascagoula base oil plant. Gains on midstream asset sales improved earnings by $40 million between quarters. The other bar reflects a number of items including stronger chemicals results. Turning to Slide 12, international downstream earnings decreased $84 million between quarters. Increased volumes improved earnings by $75 million following the completion of turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa Refineries last quarter. Lower refinery margins decreased earnings by $15 million reflecting higher crude cost that could not be fully recovered in the marketplace. Foreign exchange losses were approximately $55 million higher compared to prior quarter. The second quarter had a loss of about $85 million compared to a loss of about $30 million in the first quarter. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $30 million. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including minor asset transactions and lower trading results. George will now provide an update on our upstream operations. George? George Kirkland : Thank you, Jeff. First I would like to highlight the progress on our Gorgon project. This photo shows the LNG plant in the foreground with the jetty in the distance. We continue to make excellent progress in the module fabrication yards and on Barrow Island. Module delivers are continuing on schedule and we are achieving our key milestones. Gorgon remains on track for a startup next year and will be a key contributor to our production grown in 2015 and beyond. I\u2019ll share a bit more on Gorgon later. Consistent with prior quarters we have posted additional progress photos for both Gorgon and Wheatstone, which can be found on our Investor page at Chevron.com. Now let's take a look at our Upstream financial performance on Slide 14. Our 2014 year-to-date Upstream earnings margins was $20.32 per barrel. The suggested margin does not include gains from any of our recent asset sales in this quarter. Based on the results for our peer group through the first half of the year we lead all our competitors by an average of over $3.50 per barrel. Relative to the first half of 2013, our earnings margins have softened. Foreign exchange swings reduced our margin by a $1.42 per barrel. This combined with higher exploration expansions and DDNA have been the primary contributors to this decline. We are cognizant of the current microenvironment, increasing cost of goods and services coupled with relatively flat commodity prices and we remain focused on managing controllable cost. Looking forward, we are expecting strong contributions from our new MCPs as they come online. Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2014 production results and outlook on Slide 15. Production in the first half of the year averaged 2.57 million barrels a day at an average year-to-date Brent price of just under $109 per barrel. The first half results are 43,000 barrels per day or 1.7% below our guidance. Relative to our guidance, production entitlement effects reduced production by approximately 20,000 barrels a day and the unplanned outage at Angola LNG reduced production by a further 15,000 barrels per day. Our base business performed well. Over the six months of the year, we have maintained a base decline rate of less than 3%. We also continue to see strong growth from shale and tight assets. During the second half of 2014, we anticipate further production ramp up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and our two Gulf of Mexico developments Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo as these are all scheduled to come online. During the second half of the year, we will perform the second of two planned turnarounds at TCO as well as execute large turnarounds in Thailand and in the North Sea. The product entitlement effects are anticipated to continue and we don\u2019t expect any LNG production in the second half of the year. Completed asset sales in the first half will of course affect second half production. We forecast 2014 production will average 98% to 99% of our January guidance. Our 2017 growth to 3.1 million barrels per day remains on track as we bring on our new projects and progress our shale and tight resources. I would like to provide you with a little more detail on the production growth, which we anticipate will occur over the next several years. Turning to Slide 16, our peer-leading growth to 2017 is largely driven the startup of our major capital projects. For the last several years, we\u2019ve been in a period of high investment while our MCPs progress through the construction phase. As these projects now transition to operations, beginning with our deepwater projects Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo, we forecast significant volume and earnings growth. We remain focused on executing our industry-leading queue of projects with excellence. We have the right people and processes to deliver these projects and we are excited about the value creation. While many projects contribute to our growth, the majority of our new volume is generated by aid of our largest MCPs. Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia; Mafumeira Sul and ALNG in Angola, Papa-Terra in Brazil and Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells and Bigfoot in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Now I will review progress on six of these projects. Moving to Slide 17. In early April, Angola LNG experienced a failure in the flare blow down piping system. At the time of our first quarter earnings call, the investigation was still underway. Following a thorough analysis, a number of design issues have been identified, which will require modifications. In addition to the piping repairs, the LNG team will utilize this shutdown to perform capacity and reliability enhancements to the plant. Following completion of repairs and testing, the plant will restart and it is expected to achieve sustained production in the second half of 2015. The Gorgon project is now more than 83% complete. All Train 1 and common modules required for LNG operations have been delivered to Barrow Island and installed on foundations. Other down string work of Barrow continues to progress well with the jetty now 97% complete and the commissioning beginning this month on LNG Tank 1. Delivery of Train 2 modules has begun and 5 are now on site. On the Gorgon upstream, hydrotesting has been completed on all 660 km of offshore pipelines. The well flow back and clean up operations on the eight Gorgon wells is ongoing and drilling has been completed on the tenth and final Jansz-Io development well. The next major milestone is the completion of LNG tank 1, which is targeted for the end of this quarter. Wheatstone is now 40% complete. Dredging, build and piling work is progressing on schedule. The shore pool of the main 44-inch trunkline through the microtunnel was completed safely and as planned. Shipments from fabrication yards have commenced with the delivery of the first slug catcher components two side. The Wheatstone platform and topsides are now more than 63% complete and we anticipate the sailway of the platform\u2019s zero gravity structure in August. Wheatstone remains on track for a late 2016 startup. Now I will review progress on our deep water Gulf of Mexico projects. Moving to slide 18. The Tubular Bells project is nearing startup. All key tie-ins have been installed and tested and the wells are ready for production. Production operations are anticipated to come -- to commence in the third quarter. The remaining work on Jack/St. Malo is progressing well and the project remains on track for late fourth quarter startup. Overall hookup in commissioning and startup progress is now 73% complete. Tie-in spools for the Steel Catenary Risers have been installed and gas pipeline pre-commissioning is complete. Jack/St. Malo will be a key contributor to our production growth in 2015 as production ramps up. Bigfoot shipyard related construction is over 90% complete and preparations are being made for a fourth quarter sailway. Fabrication work on the tension leg platform tendons is now complete and whole and topside integration is nearing completion. The project team marked a major milestone with the heavy lifts of the drilling modules this quarter and as you can see in the picture on the slide. Bigfoot remains on track for a 2015 startup. We are pleased with the progress on our key deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. As these three projects ramp up during the next year, we will see a significant uptick in production as we move towards our 2017 goal. At peak capacity, these projects will deliver Chevron approximately 100,000 net barrels per day. Now I will provide an update on our shale and tight activities. Please turn to slide 19. Chevron is the largest producer in the Permian and has an enviable acreage position. We have the largest and developed leasehold and 90% of our acreage is either low or no royalty. We have over 17,000 well prospects identified and the potential to add eight to 10,000 more. Since we are not in a drill or drop situation our approach has been to allow others to derisk acreage surrounding our own. This enables us to focus our capital on development wells rather than exploration and appraisal. In the Midland basin of the Wolfcamp play, industry drilling today has been predominantly via vertical wells. Earlier this summer, we spotted our first horizontal Wolfcamp well. We now have 17 rigs operating in the Midland basin and 10 rigs operating in the Delaware basin where we added two rigs this quarter. We are on schedule to drill more than 500 wells this year in the Permian basin. Turning now to Argentina, Chevron is please with our initial results in the Vaca Muerta. Drilling results have helped us identify two sweet spots where we are focusing our activity. In one of these areas, we have commenced a horizontal program. We have seen a production uptick, which gives us confidence that we will deliver the growth we anticipated when we entered this play. Good progress is being made on our Duvernay program in Canada. Our wells have demonstrated good blow rates and high condensate yields and we are confident of the quality of our acreage. In the third quarter, we anticipate spotting the first of 16 wells as part of our expanded appraisal program. Also in Canada, we are continuing with the appraisal campaign in the Liard Basin. Results continue to indicate very favorable ultimate recoveries and high IPs, which will support our longer term plans for this asset. Moving to Slide 20. I will now highlight a few additional ongoing activities. We continue to have good success on our exploration program in the Carnarvon Basin in Australia. Since our announcement of Elphin 1 in April of last year we have made four additional discoveries. This provides us with additional gas resource and optimization alternatives for our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities. In March, we stayed at our target to deliver 10 billion in asset sales over the 2014 to 2016 time period and we are on our way to meeting that goal. Our recent divestiture of the Chad assets is one example of our focus on monetizing a mature declining business, which allows us to generate cash for potential reinvestment in other growth areas. We are also progressing the sale of several other mature assets including the Netherlands, our non-operated interest in Draugen in Norway, several leases in Nigeria as well as several smaller assets from our conventional North American portfolio. We recently achieved a major milestone at our Escravos gas-to-liquids plant with the production of GTL diesel in that. We anticipate continued ramp-up in first product lifting later this year. Our exploration and development program in the Utica is yielding good results for both liquids and gas. Industry results in the Utica shale have been encouraging from Ohio into West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We recently achieved a test of more than 32 million standard cubic feet per day on a 22/64\u2019s choke at one of our wells in the emerging southern trend. We anticipate this well will be turned into line this fall. And finally we\u2019re also very encouraged with the initial results in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Exploratory drilling and logging has indicated multiple play zones in a large structure. We have begun initial drillstone test and the formations have demonstrated the ability to deliver high liquid blow rates. On one of the two wells, we plan to test upto nine different zones. We\u2019ll continue with our KRI testing program over the months ahead. Now I will turn it back to Pat. Pat Yarrington : Okay, thanks George. Turning to Slide 21. I would like to close with just a few thoughts. Global energy demand continues to grow and satisfying demand growth is a great business opportunity for us. We\u2019ve had the same basic strategies for a long time now. We believe they remain relevant and that they will continue drive future value growth for our shareholders. We continue to focus on executions. You just heard from George that our base business in the upstream continues to perform well and that we\u2019re making significant progress on our major capital projects. In the downstream we can also report success. The Pascagoula base oil plant or PBOP as we call it is now online. First commercial production began in June and the plant rampup to full production ended July. We are now the largest producer of premium base oil worldwide. Focus on execution also means operating safely and reliably. Through six months our personal and process safety performance has been strong across all the measures we typically share with you. The days away from work rate Tier-1 loss of containment and spills. Sustained value creation requires reinvestment in our business. This is necessary to meet future energy demand and is vital to sustaining growing rewards for our share holders. We have a broad, balanced and deep queue of investment opportunities and take a highly disciplined approach to capital allocations. We are actively managing our portfolio and are on track to meet our stated target of achieving proceeds from asset sales of $10 billion over the 2014 to 2016 time period. Through six months, asset sell proceeds at total $1.6 billion now are making good progress on a number of other planned transactions. We have the best growth profile amongst the peers between now and 2017. Every quarter as project milestones are checked off, we get one step closer to the inflexion point. Indeed, two of the projects George highlighted are set to startup in the second half of this year and two more in 2015. Along with this sizeable growth in volume, we expect will come significant growth in cash flows. We expect free cash flow to grow as well, thereby enabling higher shareholder distributions over time. I short we are very excited about what lies ahead for the company. So that concludes our prepared remarks. I certainly appreciate you listening in this morning. We are now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and one followup if necessary. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Ed Westlake : Yes, good morning and thanks, George, for your time on the upstream as well. Maybe just firstly a question on cash flow. Last year about $36 billion, this year sort of $33 billion if you annualize the first half and obviously oil prices have state higher. It looks as if your turnarounds are in high margin areas, but is there any other deterioration in the cash flow relative to your expectations? Obviously you have given us some guidance on the Analyst Day of relatively strong cash flow growth from the 2013 basis as these major projects come on stream. Pat Yarrington : Ed, we still feel good about our cash flow projections going out 2015, 2016 and 2017 and again it is obviously predicated on the production growth that George went through on major capital projects growth in the Permian and then also of course oil prices will be quite impactful there. If you\u2019re looking at the first half of this year, relative to the second half, I think one of the comments I would make would be downstream. Downstream has not been as cash prolific perhaps as certainly we would like. Many of the turnarounds that have -- we talked about on the slides are in the rear-view mirror so to speak at this point and so the second half of the year, we believe should be a better cash generation from a downstream standpoint. Ed Westlake : Okay. Then a question on the upstream just generally. I'm looking at Slide 10 and of course you are slightly lower on production this year. But if you add up the turnaround production entitlements and base business you are losing some volumes, but even without major capital projects the volume trajectory is relatively flat. And then as I look at the slide that you put out, helpfully, on MCPs getting up to 900,000 barrels a day from the big projects and the other stuff that you are doing. And then I think about shale, it feels like something has to get worse to miss the 3.1 million barrel a day sort of 2017 guidance, which is a good position to be in. But I am just wondering what is it that gets worse in your assumptions as you look out? George Kirkland : Ed I just don\u2019t have any things to get worse on our assumptions. If you remember when we came through at the SAM meeting and gave you our forecast of 3.1 we showed a 50,000 barrel a day buffer, so there is a buffer in there. The only and part of the reason we had that buffer in there was always the forecasting ability but recognize that we\u2019ve talked a lot more about asset sales and we have asset sales in our plan. We don\u2019t always know exactly what assets sales will actually occur. We are very focused always on the value proposition of those and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve got to focus on, creating the greatest value on those asset sales and it is a reminder, when we look at asset sales, we\u2019re looking at two pieces. We\u2019re looking end of life assets, do they have continuing investment opportunities and then of course we look at some of our assets that are on the front that don\u2019t compete for funds. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of latitude in there to cover some of the assets sale losses that occur when we sell these properties but I can\u2019t give you the details on those because we are very value driven. We\u2019re going to make the best decision on getting the greatest value for anything we sell. Ed Westlake : And very sneakily at the end, just in terms of three questions, it is not an entitlement change as you go forward. The pace of current entitlement changes stays flat through the forecast, do you think? George Kirkland : Let me explain a little bit about the entitlement change in there and this probably heads off a question that we\u2019re likely to get from others. Each year when we give you our production forecast we have modeled and we have all kinds of assumptions on production entitlements. We do our very best job to try to nail those entitlements. We have a 20,000 barrel a day impact in our entitlements that are greater than what we had anticipated. We've shown that in that section, for me -- you have to understand. When we model this we\u2019ve all kinds of assumptions there. I\u2019ll just deal with two of those, the two biggest ones that make up most of this 20,000 barrels a day. The two of them are in TCO and in Bangladesh. The TCO one, we make assumptions of how much crude we\u2019re going to move via rail versus how much crude we\u2019re going to move on the CPC pipeline. We have that assumption. That comes up and tells us what we\u2019re going to -- gives us a really good indication of royalty net back that the well has. That gives us net back that the well heads, which impacts our royalty assumptions. This year we have moved more barrels on the CPC because it was available, actually about 80,000 barrels a day in TCO was moved more than was in the plan. That\u2019s great for us. That\u2019s great for Kazakhstan, great for the partnership because we get higher net backs. We\u2019ve also had higher prices on the sulphur and sulphur sold at a higher price translates to a higher net back for us that the well had also. And that reduces net production. It\u2019s a really good thing for all of us. So that\u2019s really positive. So if the value decision, right value decision. Similarly in Bangladesh, we\u2019ve had an agreement on how we would look at that. That is now going to be reimbursed and the reimbursement will not will in effect reduce our cost barrels. There is a impact on that. It\u2019s good for us to clear up the bad issue. It\u2019s good from a profit gas or profit oil basis going forward that removes that cost out of it. So that\u2019s another value creator for us not nearly as big as the TCO one but it\u2019s a positive for us and those two items made most of the difference on this entitlement. Good things, right way to run the business but we didn\u2019t have it modeled that way in our plan, so -- and I\u2019ll tell you we\u2019re always going to go after the piece that makes the most value sense. Maybe that will help. Ed Westlake : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning everyone. Pat Yarrington : Good morning Paul Sankey : The first question I had is for George. Relating to the startups in the lower tertiary. George, you said in the past that the key to really good returns there would be increasing recoveries from I think you plan on 10% towards 20% recoveries. What is the path towards us -- and the timeframe I guess, towards us getting a better idea of how those recoveries will play out? Thanks. George Kirkland : Paul thanks for the question. Historically what we had actually said is we looked at recoveries initially would be in the 8% to 10% range and then that we saw technologies, either completion technologies, reducing back pressure on the reservoir, items such as those technologies that would increase the recovery towards the 15 and then onto 20%. We do believe we are on track for that. I am going to feel a lot more confident as we get the first Jack/St. Malo wells on and we see our new completion technology, how successful we are there. We\u2019ll be watching production rates. I\u2019ll tell you I am encouraged that we\u2019ve done the cleanup on a number of those wells already. So when the facilities are ready, we\u2019ll be able to turn them on and we\u2019ll initially get a quick look of course at production rates. If our production rates are at the high end of our assumption, that\u2019s going to give us confidence that we\u2019re going to get a little bit more recovery. We should actually have some pretty good confidence in that on the little bit of impact on our recovery view and of course we\u2019ll have a much stronger view on production volumes as we get to the end of the year end March as we get a little bit of runtime on these wells. I feel good about what we\u2019ve seen on the cleanup though and I\u2019ll just leave it there qualitatively. Paul Sankey : Okay. Interesting. And then the follow-up I had was on Gorgon start up. When you say mid-2015 is that the first production of gas, the first production of LNG or the first sale of LNG? Thanks. George Kirkland : It is the first production of LNG. It\u2019s not gas introduced into the plant. We\u2019ve a target to see gas introduced into the plant this year because we need the gas introduced into the plant to start commissioning activities. So one of our early activities is getting gas introduced in the plan getting the turbine generators running, get the power support for the operations. That utility piece is very critical to the startup and it\u2019s actually a milestone that we\u2019ll be talking about more in the next quarter\u2019s call. Paul Sankey : Cool and then the actual sale of LNG. When would that be? George Kirkland : I am not going to go that next step. I am going to leave it till we have the first LNG in the tank, which we will announce and once we have first LNG we\u2019ll be announcing our target for first lifting. Paul Sankey : Interesting. Thanks. And you are still trying to sell more contracts there, aren't you? Is there any reason why we haven't heard more about that given you have shown modeling of a shortage of LNG long-term? I'm just surprised we haven't heard more about contracts. And I will leave it there. Thank you. George Kirkland : Paul. We are still looking at opportunities so to sell more gas. We really don\u2019t have a lot more to sell. Remember on the Wheatstone side, we already stood at 85%. so we are fully sold out there. As a reminder, we have some ability to move gas in our contracts from different assets we own. So we have some flexibility there. We are still once again looking to increase that, but we are value driven so we need to get a price that we think is appropriate. The spot market has been good on a seasonal basis the last year so we feel pretty good about the volumes if we had to move them into the spot side. Preferentially we would move them to a longer term sales contract if we get the right kind of price. Pat Yarrington : And Paul, I would just add that with the degree of uncertainty that there is about U.S. exports and the size of U.S. exports, I think there -- you can understand why buyers might want to wait a little bit to see how that all lands out before going forward to secure longer term contracts. Paul Sankey : Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. Pat, I wonder if I could follow-up on Ed Westlake's question because this is something we have been kind of wrestling with. It may be overly simplistic, but you gave us cartoon at the Analyst Day that showed how the cash margin improves let's say in a $110 oil environment, so let's call that same-store sales with last year at $36 billion. But when we take the delta on production growth and the delta on the margin, it only adds about $8 billion to the cash flow, so that gets you to $44 billion, you are spending a little under $40 billion, the dividends are $7 billion and your buybacks are $5 billion. So can you help me with what else are you assuming in that inflection in cash flow that you talked about in your prepared remarks because your offstream guidance doesn't really seem to get us there. Pat Yarrington : Are you talking about 2015 or 2017? Doug Leggate : In the cartoon it shows the post 2016 portfolio which I assume is, if we look at 2.1 million barrels a day in 2017 and the current portfolio at 2.7 million barrels a day last year would generate the $36 billion. So I'm trying to understand how big do you think the delta is, because according to your cartoon it is only about $8 billion. Pat Yarrington : Let me just start. So we -- if you start from a 2013 base and you look out to 2015, let me just be clear on the assumptions that we have in there. So we\u2019re moving from the 2.7 million barrels a day last year to the 3.1 million barrels a day in 2017. The assumption on price in that slide was $110 a barrel Brent and when you get the increase in volume and you also get an accretion on the cash margin and that accretion is coming from significantly the major -- major capital projects that George has just run through, predominantly Gorgon and Wheatstone are huge contributors to that. That is really what gives you an underlying increase in upstream cash flows between what we saw at the base in 2013 and what we\u2019re expecting in 2017. On top of that, there will be we believe higher contributions in cash flows from our downstream sector. Obviously it's not as significant growth element there but there will be contributions on the chemical side and on the lubricant side and some of the R&M side. So when you put those components altogether we feel comfortable about saying under those set of assumptions particularly price and volume we\u2019re going get to $50 million cash generation figure. And I think the point that\u2019s really important here is the margin accretion that George has -- we've talked it for a couple of years here is not just on the incremental barrels, it's on the full portfolio and that\u2019s really what is the compelling point here, is that those projects coming online have the capacity to pull up the entire cash margin over the whole portfolio. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer. I will take it off-line with Jeff because, like I say, I am using your numbers and the delta looks like $8 billion, but I will talk to Jeff offline. My follow-up is really a Gorgon question, George, and thanks for getting on the call this morning. You talk about start up on Train 1, but can you talk to the ramp up to Train 3? Because obviously -- you are obviously familiar with the charter that has been out there constantly while this project has been moving forward, but start up is one thing but what about the ramp beyond that? Can you give us some comfort level on the pacing of Trains 2 and Trains 3 and I will leave it there? George Kirkland : Historically what we\u2019ve said, we said we saw six months between train startups. So I\u2019ll try to give you a little more context to what\u2019s happening on train 2 and train 3 and I think very frankly it\u2019s very good news on the train 2. Modules we expect we\u2019ll have almost -- well, I'll just say most of the modules we\u2019re trying to own Barrow Island by the end of the year and we will even have a few we think of the train 3 modules. So the module piece of the work is going quite well, so it\u2019s moving forward very well. We don\u2019t see any of the module work at this point on the critical path. So all of that puts us in a strong position to say we\u2019re not seeing any slide on time between the startup of train 1 and train 2 and if anything, we may even see that tighten up a little bit but it\u2019s a little early to go there so but it looks good at this point and that\u2019s a real positive. Critical for us to get \u2013 get we'll try to get it offline. Jeff Gustavson : And then we\u2019ll answer a lot of questions. Okay? Doug Leggate : Thanks very much indeed. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Hey, good afternoon guys. The position on free cash flow is clear. A question for George. Staying with LNG, one of your partners, Apache, yesterday announced plans to execute on that LNG and Wheatstone for that matter. Any update on that project and does Apache's exit change any as how you think about the risk profile of that potential project? George Kirkland : Let me on -- we're -- we need to get our partnership resolved. That means Apache needs to move through the issues and we need to get a new partner in. That needs to happen. That\u2019s I think quite obvious. As long as we keep moving forward in the assessment of the resource in Liard I feel very good about the resource assessment. I think we already can check off our confidence level on the other resource, the Horn River resources is already high. We\u2019ve really done that appraisal so the focus on the resource side is really drilling in Liard, some appraisal work there and getting some production work. We think we\u2019ll have those actually those wells -- those first wells that we need to get some production data. We\u2019re going to be complete with them somewhere near the end of the year. So that\u2019s really important step for us. The other pieces that we\u2019re spending money on only aren\u2019t related to Liard. There\u2019s a little bit of money on how we\u2019re going to actually handle the upstream initial production and then of course we\u2019ve to focus on the pipeline and the pipeline quarter. That\u2019s important for us. We\u2019re putting some money into that to try to finalize a pipeline, rounding it all in clearances and then we\u2019ve got work at this point going on field work. Some field work on the plant itself. We have to understand cost and schedule on that plant. Those are the important things. We\u2019re not spending huge money but it is a lot of money in the sense I am sure for -- in the terms of 100s of millions of dollars. Now it\u2019s critical for us to have all of that where we can deal knowledgably with buyers. We have to understand cost. We have to understand resource where we can deal with the particulars of pricing, but we are not going to do a project unless it\u2019s economic. We\u2019ve always told you we\u2019re not going to go to FID one project till we have 16% of the gas sold. We\u2019ve to understand the project in a good sense to do that. So we\u2019ve got to understand project. We\u2019ve got to understand resource. I think we\u2019re moving quite well on answering the resource issue. I am not concerned with -- if Apache leaves that there I think we could easily step in and be operator of the upstream, quite confident there. Apache has been very good to work with in this early stages of the assessment at Liard. So I think we\u2019re in good shape but we need to get clarity, we need to cope, we need to get the closure on the partnership and this work. I\u2019ve mentioned we need to do all of that where we can deal with buyers and understand cost and understand economics. We are very value driven. We\u2019re not going to go to an FID and do a project until we have gas sales and we understand the economics of that sale. Evan Calio : Great, thanks. And my follow-up is if you could discuss Permian production in the quarter, and just how much did that contribute to the sequential 5% increase in U.S. volumes? And then as you think about 2015 and really bridging to the major project volumes in 2016 through 2018, do you see a scope and ability to further ramp Permian more significantly to bridge, like I said, the other major projects? Thanks. George Kirkland : Let me start with the last part of that a little bit. Permian for us is an area we can increase investment and increase production. We will rather ramp at a appropriate speed where we are very cost efficient on drilling and on our infrastructure. So from that perspective, it is a little bit of an asset that we can gauge and move to speed. Specifically in the quarter I think we had a 5,000 barrel a day plus in from the Permian area that was good. We\u2019re right now running I said 27 rigs. We\u2019ve 14 verticals and 13 horizontals. So that\u2019s really good. I gave you the numbers on the slide of how many wells that have been drilled this year and I believe that was 265. We had told you in March this year that we were going to drill 500. You can see that we are ahead of schedule on that. I take it\u2019s related to some efficiency we\u2019ve seen in the rig operations. We\u2019ve got a grand focus on reducing cost. This business out there is frankly about two things. It\u2019s drilling cost, getting your drilling cost down and getting your recovery up. We\u2019ve got great focuses on both of those and like we\u2019re seeing the response. We\u2019re getting a few more wells and we\u2019re getting more barrels. We like what we\u2019ve seen. The more we continue to see that of course we are going to be more willing to push more money there. Evan Calio : Great. George. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Cheng : Hi guys. George, two questions if I could. On both Wheatstone and Kitimat, can you talk about from Chevron's position whether you have any interest to further increase your existing interest? George Kirkland : Paul, I\u2019ll be happy to and maybe I\u2019ll for everyone on the phone I\u2019ll put in perspective a little bit. Wheatstone and our interest is relative but to others and I\u2019ll try to do that on Kitimat. At the Wheatstone asset level, so this is Wheatstone and Iago, the upstream piece of it, we hold 80% of that. Remember you have a partnership that\u2019s between Apache and KUFPEC that is Brunello Julimar online into a common facility offshore and that our investments in the Wheatstone project and the LNG portion of it is unitized if you will after that. The fields are not but we have a joint project from a central platform, a trunkline and into an LNG plant and at that point when you look at the LNG portion of it downstream, that portion of it -- we are investing 64%. We\u2019ve got all the interest we really want. It\u2019s a high end of our interest that we would normally have in any operation. I typically like to be when I operate in this 40% to 60% range. So our working interest is at the high end of that and we\u2019re quite comfortable. We don\u2019t see any reason to have any more working interest in Wheatstone or other assets there. Now speaking on Kitimat and I\u2019ll build off on some of those earlier comments. We hold 50% of the interest in Kitimat, Liard, Horn River assets. That\u2019s right in the middle of the sweet spot where we like to be on working interest where we\u2019re committing to run the projects and run operations. What we\u2019ve told the street in the past and I will reinforce this, we actually hold 50% of it and I don\u2019t want any more than the 50% and we do have available some small amount of working interest that we would provide to an LNG buyer and there\u2019s always been plan for us and Apache to have some volumes that we could -- some interest that could be sold down to buyers where they would be a part of the development and they would be in the full value chain. That has not changed and I am not looking to increase our working interest beyond the 50%. Paul Cheng : Second question, if I am looking at page 16 of the presentation, next year the major projects, the current expected increase is 150,000 barrels per day. Your base operation previously assumed is at 3% underlying decline curve, I assume that has not changed. That translated to roughly about an 80,000 barrels per day job year over year. So that means that based on this particular graph it would suggest this seems to imply your expected production growth for next year about 2% to 3%, get to about 2.65. I don't know whether you can give us a number what is your current projection for 2015 or if not can you tell us whether there is any other things that we should take into consideration in this calculation? George Kirkland : Paul you are good with numbers. Okay, let me speak qualitative to this. First up, we give you our commitment number guidance in January each year. So in January 2015, we\u2019ll give you our guidance. I\u2019ll only give a few qualitative comments about -- you've done the numbers right relative to the MCPs. Our base decline is running in this 3% or less. That\u2019s true. We haven\u2019t yet given you guidance on two other items and I will tell you we\u2019re working that at this point in time. How many barrels are we going to have on our shale and tight? We have got investments going in shale and tight and the Permian. That\u2019s not in this number. How well is Vaca Muerta going to actually perform? So we\u2019ve got those two that are significant and we\u2019ve got to identify those as we got through our business plan process and of course we\u2019ve got another one that we haven\u2019t told anyone and we haven\u2019t ourselves haven\u2019t decided on which assets we\u2019re going to sell. So we\u2019ve got some sells that are going to occur. We are once again value drive. Actually I don\u2019t know which ones are the ones that we\u2019re going to end up and sell. What\u2019s the whole value open for us versus what will someone else pay on these late life assets. So those are the two aspects that I can\u2019t really answer at this point in time. But we will be able to give an answer in January. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jeffries and Company. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Thanks, everyone. I wanted to come back to Gorgon if I could. George, if I was interpreting your comments correctly, it seems that critical path on Train 1 would be more delivering first gas on the island and commissioning work on the train itself and also the utilities. Can you confirm that is correct? And when you think about the risks towards meeting that mid-2015 objective, where would you put labor amongst those and what is your labor contract situation? I am just thinking in light of what is happening on Curtis Island right now? George Kirkland : Let me start off on the critical path items going for us. ME&I is critical for startup. That is heavily dependent on labor productivity. We\u2019ve got over 5,000 people working on the island. It\u2019s all about for us getting as much of that effort focused on the ME&I piece of it/ And I guess I would add one other thing and we don\u2019t find any unknown problem. As we get closer and closer to startup and this is true for every project that everyone does in the world, it's these unknowns that you just frankly don\u2019t know what's going to come up and is it something that is easily mitigated or is it something not and we don\u2019t ever know that until we get them all done. The good news is that every day you get closer, you eliminate more and more of them and being an 83% we\u2019ve already eliminated a lot of them like logistic we know is not a critical path. We were worried about the jetty. It\u2019s not the critical path. So we\u2019re eliminating those every day. Some big milestones that we\u2019ll report out in the following quarters. An example of big one that we don\u2019t have the tank. We want to make sure we got LNG tank 1 ready. Often on LNG projects the tanks are the critical path. We\u2019re just about to the point to say LNG tank 1, with it being complete, it\u2019s not going to be in the critical path. I mentioned ME&I one of the big next ones for us is the startup of our turbine generators. We\u2019ve got all five of our generators there on the island, the next big step and a big important step for us milestone is of course power. We get the power running. That puts us in a great position on the commissioning and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll talk about on our next call, so we\u2019ll keep giving you this information as we click them off and I do encourage everyone since this being brought up again is -- take a look at some of those photos that we have. They are -- I think they really give you a flavor of what work is being completed. Jason Gammel : And George, where do you set in terms of labor contracts -- or excuse me, where do some of the contractors set in terms of their labor contracts? And do you have any changes to cost estimate? I think I know the answer to that one. And would you expect to do a Wheatstone cost evaluation at the 50% completion mark like what you did with Gorgon? George Kirkland : That\u2019s a yes. We always do that on all our projects Jason. Labor is very important. We never take that for granted. We always have a strong focus on the industry relations piece. We do have some contracts that have to be renegotiated and of course we\u2019re going to focus on making sure we deal with them where they don\u2019t become an issue. Jason Gammel : Thanks a lot George. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John herland from Societe Generale. Your question please. John Herland : Thank you. I have got a couple of quick ones for you, George. With Jack/St. Malo, are you going to ramp those wells up the way you would a Miocene well since they are different? Just curious. George Kirkland : I would actually think that we\u2019re going to probably see a little bit slower ramp up on those. Remember these are very high pressure wells. The last thing we want to do is do any damage to the completion. So we\u2019re going to be very focused and I would say probably a little bit on the cautious side on the ramp of these and make sure we really understand what\u2019s happening at the place of the completion. John Herland : Great, thanks. Then with the Permian, you are talking about drilling a lot of wells. Any issues with basin evacuation in terms of fluids or gas -- in terms of infrastructure. George Kirkland : I think it is becoming a little more challenging for the industry in total. We feel very good about where we are and our position. That\u2019s one of the huge benefits for being a company that\u2019s been a large producer there for the long history of the basin. So we\u2019re in a good position on that. I would tell you the other real positive, the industry in Texas moves darn quick in solving infrastructure problems. John Herland : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could follow-up on an earlier question in terms of the pace of the onshore. If we look at your performance, I think over the past 12 months these biggest bar on the growth side was from your tight and shale assets. You have got extremely high quality positions in the Permian and Argentina and a number of other places. And given the volatility of performance in some international offshore assets on timing and the smoother profile and the returns on the onshore side, is there a case to be made, not just over the next 12 months, but over the next five years to reallocate more capital in that direction and away from some of the other projects? George Kirkland : We had to look at it on a portfolio basis and that\u2019s what we do each and every year as we build a new three year business plan and actually a longer strategic plan. We have a portfolio that has lots of options out there. You can move things in and out quite easily but it takes a portfolio that\u2019s got these options available. We do that each and every year. We don\u2019t like to jerk any of our business around. We would like to keep our rig counts if they are growing. We would like to keep them growing in a gradual manner not a big spurt. We\u2019re more efficient when we do that and of course we have to balance all that with our capital programs. We don\u2019t have an infinite amount of capital spend. So we try to get our capital focused on how we can get the best returns. So we\u2019re going to I guess high grade our view going forward of how we want to spend our money in our business plan each year. We told you at our Analyst Meeting that in the next three years, we\u2019re going to be really capital flat, pretty capital flat. That means we\u2019re going to be looking at how we get the most value out of that capital we spend. My anticipation is that we\u2019ll continue to see a little more money continuing to grow, go the Permian Basin but the Permian Basin or these other shale plays cannot offset the impact of these big projects either. We need all of that in our portfolio to grow. We must have all the big projects and frankly what the continuous plays give us. They give us another piece that\u2019s more continuous in growth and a nice part to have in your portfolio and we\u2019re going to grow that a little bit over time. So it\u2019s going to give us a little more flexibility as we go forward. Ryan Todd : Okay. Pat Yarrington : Okay I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question here. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks. I\u2019ve two quick ones. You\u2019ve highlighted the production uplift from the Vaca Muerta but given the headlines from Argentina this week are you reconsidering or just doing any investment? George Kirkland : We believe our contract and the terms we have and have them negotiated provide us appropriate cover and I am just going to leave it there. We feel good about our investments. The way it\u2019s set up. We\u2019re frankly pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making there. We\u2019re making good progress. The next big thing for me is actually continuing to watch the performance of the asset and I am particularly interested in these two new sweet spots where we\u2019re drilling more wells and what I want to see there is I want to see a production kick-up and then I\u2019ll feel better but I feel contractually with what we\u2019ve established. Pavel Molchanov : Okay, that is helpful. And on Kitimat, given the pending Apache exit, are you still likely to be able to reach FID by the end of this year or are we looking at 2015 at this point? George Kirkland : We will reach FID when we -- and we\u2019re running our business there to be able to get to FID shortly after having 60% to 70% of our gas committed to an SPA, a sales and purchase agreement. That is the critical decision maker on both timing and the investment decision. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. So irrespective of what happens with Apache? George Kirkland : Irrespective of what happens with Apache. We\u2019re driven by once again having a sales contracts or sale contracts that give us 60% to 70% of the gas committed and for an economic price. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Thanks very much. Pat Yarrington : Okay thank you. Before we close the call, I would like to mention that going forward we will no longer be issuing an interim update. For those of you who have followed us for some time, you will know that we have modified the format of our update over the past few years in an effort to have it be a clear and effective document. I have to say that that effort has not met with 100% success. Rather many investors have suggested that it has not been all that helpful or insightful and at times has added confusion rather than clarity. That\u2019s not a good place to be and hence our decision to stop the practice. We do remain committed though to full disclosure and transparency and as we have in the past, we\u2019ll strive to be very candid and clear in describing company performance in our earnings releases and our earnings call and our 10-Ks and our 10-Qs and in all of our other investor outreach activities. I would like to thank everybody for your time today. We truly appreciate your interest in Chevron. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Pat Yarrington : Hey. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jeff Shellebarger, President, Chevron North America Exploration and Production; and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement show here on slide two. Turning to slide three, the company\u2019s third quarter earnings were $5.6 billion or $2.95 per diluted share. On a year-to-day basis, earnings were $15.8 million or $8.29 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's earnings were gains on asset sales of approximately $420 million and foreign exchange gains of $366 million and a non-recurring economic buyout of a long-term contract. Taken together, this equate to a positive $0.34 per share. On the year-to-day, the impact of foreign exchange movement is minimal, while asset sales gains and other non-recurring charges have provided a net boost to 2014 earnings of $770 million. There is a full reconciliation of these items on our last slide. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12% and our debt ratio at the end of September was 14%. We repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the third quarter and in the fourth quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount. Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $8.7 billion during the third quarter and $25 billion year-to-date. Cash, capital expenditures were $8.3 billion for the quarter and $25.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion and year-to-date $1.9 billion. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $14.5 billion, giving us a net debt position of $11 billion. Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2014 earnings were $643 million higher than third quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange movements positively affected earnings by $366 million during the quarter, representing a swing of over $600 million between periods, mostly occurring in the Upstream segment. As a reminder, foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with minimal cash flow impact. Upstream earnings decreased by $443 million between quarters. Lower realizations and liftings, and higher operating and DD&A expenses were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange movements and lower exploration expenses. Downstream results increased by about a $1 billion, driven by stronger U.S. refining and marketing results, larger gains on asset sales, favorable foreign exchange movements and timing effects related to revaluation of inventory in a lower price environment. The improvement in the other segment primarily reflects the absence of the 2013 third quarter impairment of a power-related equity affiliate. Turning to slide six, I\u2019ll now compare results for the third quarter of 2014 with the second quarter of 2014. Third quarter earnings were approximately $70 million lower than second quarter results. Again, the earnings variance between quarters reflected a $600 million favorable movement in foreign exchange effects, most of which impacted the Upstream segment. Upstream earnings decreased by $615 million, reflecting lower realizations and lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange swing between quarters and lower exploration expenses. Downstream earnings increased by almost $670 million, driven by stronger R&M results, higher gains on asset sales and a positive swing in foreign exchange between quarters, partially offset by lower chemical earnings. The decrease in the other segment largely reflects corporate tax items and higher environmental expenses. Jeff Gustavson will now take us to the comparisons by segment. Jeff Gustavson : Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the quarter were $125 million lower than second quarter results. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $175 million consistent with the decline in U.S. liquids and natural gas price indicators. Higher production volumes in San Joaquin Valley in the Permian Basin increased earnings by $40 million. Lower exploration expenses, primarily associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico increased earnings by $95 million. The other bar reflects the number of unrelated items. Lower operating expenses were more than offset by the negative impact from the economic buyout of a long-term contractual obligation. Turning to slide eight. International Upstream earnings were $490 million lower than last quarter's results. Lower crude low realizations decreased earnings by $420 million, consistent with the decline in international crude prices between quarters. Lower liftings primarily related to the sale of our Upstream interest in Chad decreased earnings by $95 million. Gains on asset sales were $430 million lower, also driven by the sale of our interest in Chad and Cameroon, which occurred during the second quarter. Favorable movements in foreign currency FX increased earnings by $490 million. The third quarter had a gain of about $340 million compared to a loss of about $150 million in the second quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower trading results and higher DD&A partially offset by lower exploration expenses. Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter 2014 and the second quarter 2014. Production increased by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 18,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian where new wells were brought online. The net impact of lower turnaround activity during the quarter increased production by 23,000 barrels per day. Planned maintenance at TCO\u2019s KTL facility in Kazakhstan, in addition to Australia, was completed in the second quarter while third quarter planned turnarounds including TCO\u2019s SGI, SGP facility in U.K. and Thailand were on balance less extensive than the prior quarter. TCO, SGI, SGP turnaround continued through October. Asset sales reduced production by 18,000 barrels per day, principally due to the sale of producing assets in Chad. As a reminder, the production impact associated with this sale had already been incorporated in both our updated production guidance for 2014, as well as in our 2017 production target of 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter 2014 and the third quarter 2013. Production was 17,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Excluding production entitlement effects and the production impact associated with asset sales, production grew by 31,000 barrels per day between periods. Unconventional production increased in the Permian, in the Vaca Muerta, in Argentina by 40,000 barrels per day. Lower turnaround activity mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico increased production by 19,000 barrels per day. Production entitlement effects decreased production by 28,000 barrels per day. The decrease in crude oil prices between periods resulted in a small increase in net production volumes primarily as a function of our production sharing contracts in Indonesia. This increase was more than offset, however, by negative production entitlement effects in Kazakhstan as well as lower cost recovery volumes due to changes in absolute spending levels. The sale of producing assets mainly in Chad reduced production by about 20,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar principally reflects normal field declines with a partial offset from the absence of external constraints, which negatively impacted production in the third quarter of 2013. Our base business continues to perform well with a base decline rate of less than 3% per year. Turning to slide 11. U.S. Downstream results increased $292 million between quarters. Higher volumes increased earnings by $160 million primarily reflecting the completion of planned turnaround activities at the El Segundo, California refinery where four new coke drums were installed. These new coke drums are expected to enhance the future reliability of the refinery. Despite declining industry refining margins on both the West Coast and Gulf Coast, our realized margins were $30 million higher. Overall, we benefited from more optimal sourcing of intermediates and other feedstocks following the completion of the El Segundo refinery's major turnaround in the prior quarter. In addition, we had improved reliability at both the Pascagoula, Mississippi and Richmond, California refineries. Pascagoula\u2019s refinery contributed a full quarter of premium base oils production, after the successful startup of its new premium base-oils plant in July. This benefited both volumes and margins. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million due to the absence of cost related to the shutdown and maintenance activities in the prior quarter. Higher gains on midstream asset sales, mainly the sale of a terminal in Beaumont, Texas, improved earnings by $115 million between the periods. Lower chemicals results along with various smaller items decreased earnings by $123 million. Chemicals earnings were affected by various impairments in addition to the Port Arthur, Texas facility being offline since early third quarter. Turning to slide 12, international Downstream earnings increased $374 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased earnings by $145 million. Falling crude prices contributed to improved refining margins across multiple refineries, in addition to the completion of plan turnarounds at our Thailand and South Korea affiliate refineries. Asia marketing margins benefited from favorable aviation price lag effects and improved retail margins. Timing effects represented a $70 million positive earnings variance between quarters, largely due to the revaluation of inventory associated with falling crude and product prices during the third quarter. Foreign exchange gains were $105 million higher compared to the prior quarter. The third quarter had a gain of about $20 million, compared to a loss of about $85 million in the second quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, mainly higher trading results. Jeff will now provide an update on our North America Upstream operations. Jeff Shellebarger : Thank you, Jeff. It\u2019s a pleasure to be on the call with you all today. I'll provide a brief overview of our North America Upstream operations, followed by a more detailed review of two key areas for us -- the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and our unconventional activities, particularly those in the Permian basin. The photo on slide 13 shows the Jack/St. Malo facility\u2019s safely mode on-location in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We continue to make steady progress towards first oil later this year. Let\u2019s turn to slide 14. Let me start by providing a brief overview of Chevron\u2019s North America Exploration and Production Company, where diverse organization made up of six business units were active in the key hydrocarbon basin across the continent. Production has averaged 731,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Year-to-date 2014, this represents almost 30% of Chevron\u2019s total Upstream volumes. The heart of our portfolio is our legacy based business, which has generated production, value creation for decades. Asset includes our Gulf of Mexico shelf, Mid-Continent conventional oil and gas operation in the San Joaquin Valley in California, where our industry-leading expertise\u2019s input operations has helped us achieve more than 50% recovery at the Kern River oilfield. These robust based business assets provide a low decline high-cash generation foundation to underpin and support our current and future growth opportunities. Next, I would like to highlight two of these areas in more detail -- deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our shale and tight assets. Slide 15, Chevron has a leading position in the Gulf of Mexico. We are the largest leaseholder. We currently produce about 200,000 barrels a day in the Gulf, slightly more than half of which comes from our existing deepwater assets. In the deepwater, we're making good progress on our major capital projects. Tubular Bells, first oil is eminent in the next few days. The remaining work on Jack/St. Malo is progressing well and the project remains on track for a late fourth quarter startup. Overall, hook-up and commissioning is about 90% complete, buyback gas was bought on board the facility last weekend. We recently completed dewatering the oil export pipeline both of these are significant milestones. Construction of the Big Foot tension leg platform is essentially complete and is ready for sail-away and offshore installations. The Central Gulf of Mexico has currently experienced a significant Loop Current event. These strong currents at the ocean surface are naturally occurring typically last one to three-months. This Loop Current is particularly strong and we are monitoring for the conditions that will allow us to proceed with installation, once the Loop Current subsides. We\u2019ve taken advantage of the extra time in the construction yard to start some pre-commissioning activities normally done offshore. Finally, investment decision was announced on the Stampede project earlier this week. On the exploration front, we recently announced the significant Lower Tertiary discovery at the Guadalupe prospect in Northern Keathley Canyon. We have also completed appraisal work at the Buckskin and Moccasin prospects and expect to move into front-end engineering and design in 2015. We have got five deepwater drill ships operating in the Gulf, two of which are focused on exploration activities, where we plan to drill four to six Impact prospects over the next 12 to 18 months. Next let\u2019s talk about shale and tight activities on slide 16. In the Permian Basin, Chevron has been active since the 20s. We continue to be a leading producer in the basin. We have an enviable acreage position. We have good exposure to the key sweet spots in the basin. Our legacy position provides critical access to infrastructure. We are employing a disciplined, value focused development strategy in the Permian. We are not in a drill or drop situation, and our low lease holding costs allow us to focus on the highest return projects in a paced matter while leveraging industry learnings. Our efforts on lowering cost while simultaneously increasing production rates and ultimate recoveries are helping to improve overall well and program economics. Finally, we've executed joint development agreements, which help optimize well placement and lateral lengths as well ensure the efficient build out of takeaway and other infrastructure. Already high level of activities in the basin continued to increase and the efficiency programs to lower cost increase EUR are working. We are anticipating that our 2014 unconventional production will be more than 10% higher than initially forecast and our long-term unconventional production growth continues to steepen, as shown on the chart on the right. We will provide an updated production forecast at our Analyst Day in March. Slide 17. Looking into the Midland Basin, production has increased by 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 40% during the first nine months of the year and we are on track to drill 10% more wells than originally planned for the year. As we mentioned during the second quarter call, we are transitioning towards a multi-well pad based horizontal program. The Midland vertical wells have demonstrated that all of the identified benches are potentially productive. Our Bradford Ranch program on the southwestern edge of the basin is a great example of our transition to horizontals. We have drilled our first two wells. We are now batch drilling the next four. The first well has been completed, it\u2019s flowing back and will be on production next month. At its full potential, we expect up to 150 wells on this development with lateral lengths ranging from 5000 to 7500 feet. We believe that we are well-positioned in what looks like the sweet spot at the Midland Basin horizontal play. Slide 18. Results from the Delaware Basin have been equally positive. Our two nonoperated joint development areas in Culberson and Eddy counties continued to deliver excellent results. Production has increased by approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 60% during the first nine months of the year and we are planning to drill 180 wells in 2014. Our company operated Salado Draw horizontal program in Lea County, New Mexico remains on track to spud its first well within the next month. While there are multiple benches in this area, we are targeting the Upper Avalon with its initial 16 well development. With success we envision more than 60 well locations at Salado Draw. Our recent well results give us continued optimism on the growth potential in the Delaware. Wells drilled in the third quarter have 30-day IPs that averaged just over 1000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. I would like to close by providing an update on some of our other key North American shale and tight assets. Let\u2019s turn to the slide 19. Starting with the Duvernay in Canada, we recently announced the sell down of 30% of our Duvernay position to Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company consistent with our risk management practices for early life assets. They are valued partner in our Wheatstone Project and we welcome them to this exciting development. The consideration received reflects the prospectivity and inherent value of our attractive acreage position, 90% of which is in a liquids rich window. Appraisal drilling has commenced on our first two horizontal well pads located in what we call the Central Focus Area. In the Utica and Marcellus, we have prioritized our near-term efforts into five core development areas across West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania. As we move more aggressively into the development mode, pad drilling, optimization of lateral lengths and completion, and the build out of water infrastructure allow us to further lower cost, increase recoveries, and therefore enhance our overall development economics. Let me turn it back over to Pat. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Thank you, Jeff. In addition to the significant amount of activity going on in our North America Upstream business, I would also like to touch on a few other highlights during the quarter. In Australia, we continue to make good progress on both the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. For Gorgon, which is now 87% complete, all of the development wells have been successfully drilled and majority are through the completion phase. LNG Tank #1 is through construction and testing, awaiting product and LNG Tank #2 is on plan to achieve that same status by the end of January. The five turbine generators are all installed and the jetty is essentially complete. 11 of 17 Train 2 modules have been received and installed. The key focus in the months ahead remains in the mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work scope on the island. The Wheatstone project is now 49% complete. The project team had a major milestone back in August, with the installation of the offshore steel gravity-based structure. The MOF or materials offloading facility is 100% operational. The Upstream drilling campaign, the fabrication of the platform, site preparation and construction of the LNG tanks are all on schedule. We are making good progress, bringing these projects online, both of which will be important contributors to production, cash flow and earnings for decades to come. I encourage you to review the new pictures that show progress on both projects on our investor page at chevron.com. In Bangladesh we achieved startup at the Bibiyana Expansion Project, which includes two new processing trains, with an incremental design capacity of 300 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of condensate per day. Moving to the Downstream, we have completed investments at several of our U.S. refineries, including El Segundo, Pascagoula and Salt Lake City. We expect these investments will lead to notable reliability and operational improvements going forward, some of which were evident in the third quarters result. Our Chevron Phillips Chemical\u2019s joint venture also continues to make good progress on its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, construction of the 1.5 million metric ton ethane cracker and the two 5,000 metric ton polyethylene units is almost 25% complete. It is on schedule and on budget. Finally, we continue to sell non-strategic assets. We\u2019re on target for achieving $10 million in asset sale proceeds from 2014 through 2016, a goal we outlined at our Analyst Day meeting last March. At nine-month, year-to-date proceeds amount to $2.6 billion and our several other transactions lined up to close in the fourth quarter or early in the New Year. I\u2019d like to close with a couple of thoughts about Chevron position and outlook, given recent commodity price decline. Our priorities haven\u2019t changed. By necessity, we take a long-term view of prices, because our investments last for decade. We continue to believe global demand for oil and natural gas will grow, while existing sources of supply will inevitably decline. And as it is always done, although, with some lag, we expect the industry cost structure will align to the revenue stream, such that economic incentives will exist to invest in developing new energy supplies. Our strategies have remained and will remain constant. They are designed for long-term value creation. Our financial priorities haven't changed. They start with growing an attractive dividend. Next we look to invest in economic projects that create value and allow us to sustain and grow the dividend for years to come. Third, we want to maintain a strong balance sheet, precisely for times like this. And finally, any available cash is distributed to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Our program is scalable and could be adjusted in a period of low prices. We\u2019ll continue to make that assessment each quarter and our future actions will obviously be influenced by how low prices stay and for how long. We remain focused on excellent execution each day and every day. Our businesses are performing well. Based on preliminary information, it appears our Upstream and our Downstream segments were number one in earnings per barrel for the quarter. Now, of course, we are cognizant of near-term price realities. Major payout -- capital projects under construction and other nondiscretionary spend represents about one-half of our current capital budget. Even at low prices, we plan to continue funding these projects, key among these are Gorgon, Wheatstone and our two operated deepwater projects. Within a year, we expect to see production from three of these four projects online and they\u2019ll turn from being cash consumers into cash generators. After that we prioritize and rank our remaining investments, that are more discretionary in nature, only funding those that are most competitive in the portfolio or where deferral can be achieved without economic loss. Permian development, for example, remains quite attractive even at lower prices. Now this ranking and prioritization is not a new process for us, it\u2019s a routine process for us. We are also keenly focused on managing operating cost. This too is not a new area of effort for us since oil prices have been drifting south for the past few years while costs have continued to rise. As we showed you last March, our costs are already highly competitive with our larger peers as well as a much broader set of E&P companies. Well before the recent price decline, several of our international and domestic business units, as well as our corporate departments already had notable cost reduction efforts underway. Finally, we plan to continue, but we will be careful about managing our ongoing asset divestment and portfolio rationalization efforts. The valuations for some assets targeted for sale are not likely to be affected by near-term circumstances, but the valuations for other prospective sale assets maybe. In all cases, we will only sale if we can capture good value. By the end of 2014, we should be well on our way to our $10 billion asset divestment target. We still have confidence in achieving it between now and the end of 2016. We have a great deal of experience and managing through prior price cycles in both our Upstream and Downstream businesses, and we feel confident in our ability to allocate capital appropriately and to sustain a competitive cost structure even in a lower commodity price world. Now that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning. We are ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if that\u2019s absolutely necessary and we\u2019ll do our very best to get all the questions answered. So Jonathan, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Jason Smith : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jason Smith on for Doug. How are you? Pat Yarrington : Oh, fine, Jason, how are you? Jason Smith : Good. So Pat, I think in your comments around some of the projects you had looked to move forward in the future, one of ones you didn't mention is the Tengiz expansion and there has obviously been some chatter around costs and timing there. Can you maybe just offer some color on your latest thoughts on whether this moves forward? Pat Yarrington : Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, this is a very attractive asset for us. It\u2019s one of the critical assets that we\u2019ve got in the company, strong earnings, strong cash flow and it has the potential we think to grow even further. There are two perspective elements of that project that I think are important to separate out. One is the Wellhead Pressure Management Project. It's really designed to keep existing capacity -- processing capacity full. And the second is a project for the growth that really could add 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, taking full field growth production up to around 1 million barrels a day. So it's a very exciting project. We are working very aggressively with our partners and with the government -- the Kazakhstan government to progress this project through to final investment decision. We have not made a final investment decision at this point in time. We don't have a cost estimate. Our teams are working very hard to conclude the final engineering, understand the full suite of the economic impacts here, get complete alignment between our partners and the government and proceed that forward. When we do take FID, we will have a number that we can put forward. Jason Smith : Got it, okay. And then we appreciate all the thoughts on buybacks and dividends going forward, but in the current oil price environment at least at present it looks like cash flow is not covering CapEx dividends and buybacks for the first nine months of the year. So if we do end up in a depressed environment, can you maybe just talk through what changes there? Pat Yarrington : Yeah. So I think Jason, it\u2019s really going to depend on the outlook that we\u2019ve got on a whole series of parameters, oil prices one, cost structure is another, length of duration of any sort of BIP or price excursion, how quickly we see the cost structure amending to that. Our capital program, balance sheet health issues, etc era and all of that gets taken into account when we look at our allocation of our cash uses. The priority, as I\u2019ve said before and we\u2019ve been long-standing in saying this is really about being able to grow our dividend. But in order to do that over a long period of time, we need to make -- continue to make very strong investments or investments in strong projects, attractive projects. We\u2019ve got a tremendous Q and we have the opportunity to do that. So we are going to be driven by the economics of the portfolio that we have at hand. We\u2019re very cognizant of the risk in our business, the commodity price cycle risk and we\u2019ve long-standing kept a pristine balance sheet to weather through positions just like this. We have a lot of borrowing capacity still ahead of us without putting into jeopardy our AA status. And we are on the cusp of getting to the point where these major capital project kick in with significant volumes and significant cash generation. So we feel very comfortable about the position that we are in and we are not bothered in a temporary sense of having to fund our shareholder distributions off of our balance sheet. We obviously can't do that for a long period of time but that is not the window that we find ourselves in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please? Jason Gammel : Thanks very much. My question is on the Permian. Jeff, I was hoping that you might be able to at least qualitatively explain why you are seeing such a significant increase in the production levels. And I guess if you'd just break it out between moving to longer laterals, the intensity of proppant in your completions, or even just higher activity levels or maybe just something else I am not thinking about. Jeff Shellebarger : Thanks for the question, Jason. It\u2019s really all of the above. Maybe start back with a year ago, a lot of our activity was focused on appraisal and we had some lease tenure work to do up in the Delaware with the Chesapeake acquisition. Most of that work is done. That\u2019s helped us identify the sweet spots that we want to be in. As you know, the industry is innovating every single day on completions and designs. So we are adopting those designs, the pioneers to our business. So lateral lengths are increasing, stages in those lateral lengths are increasing, propane amounts are increasing. All of that is driving, not only our performance for a while but the entire industry\u2019s performance for a while in an upward direction. And then finally on top of that, our activity in general with more development program has increased year-over-year and that\u2019s driving the production growth. Jason Gammel : Great. And I really did have a true follow-up on this one. I think you said that the 30-day IP in the Delaware Basin was just over 1,000 barrels a day. You may have said it but I missed it, do you have a similar figure for the Midland Basin? Jeff Shellebarger : No, I don\u2019t. I mean, it\u2019s a much wider distribution over there. So we'll talk a little bit more about that at our Analyst Day meeting. Jason Gammel : Okay. Thanks. Jeff Shellebarger : Yes Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? Ryan, you might have your phone on mute. Ryan, we are still not hearing you. Pat Yarrington : Maybe we\u2019ll try to queue him up again. Let\u2019s move on to the next caller, Jonathan. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please? Paul Sankey : Hi, Pat. Can you hear me? Pat Yarrington : I can hear you. Thanks Paul. Paul Sankey : Very good. Good morning. Pat, you guided at the Analyst meeting to flat CapEx going forward. Today you seem to be saying that you may cut it. I'm not quite sure what the message is. I guess if we were to stay at current prices, we would anticipate lower CapEx in the future and you seem to be saying that would be -- well, I'm not even sure in what areas you would lower CapEx. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : Yes. So what I was tying to say is and we are just in the middle of doing our business plans at the very moment and you know our process. We go through that at this time of year. We get approval of the Board and then we come out with our capital expenditure outlook for the year and we expect to do that. That typically would happen in December. So we are right in the midst of pulling all the plans together. And obviously, we are having to have some tough discussions around what do we think the price outlook is going to be? What do we think the cost structure is going to be? How much of our capital program is really in this non-discretionary, must get through the phases since these projects are already under construction versus how much is discretionary?. And so I tried in the prepared remarks to kind of walk you through that logic. Now in the discretionary category, there are areas like exploration. Exploration would be one of the first areas that you would look to perhaps trim back in the cash flow constrained sort of mode. There are other areas that we would look to, projects that are not under construction but are in the first few phases of development. I mean, these will be projects where a deferral really doesn\u2019t result in an economic loss or value destruction. So those are the first couple of areas that we would necessarily look. I\u2019d call to your attention that there have been some projects where we have already done a pushback on the FID for various reasons. So, for example, Rosebank was one of the areas that we deferred on the final investment decision. We sent -- we basically took a loot at that again and said, let\u2019s reassess the design construct, let\u2019s reassess the economics here, and frankly, that\u2019s turning out quite well from a design concept standpoint, as well as a reserve standpoint and that effort looks to be coming forward, perhaps sometime in 2015. We have also had -- you are probably aware with, we have also had a delay in the Indonesian deepwater project, because we weren\u2019t able to get government approvals in the timeframe that allowed the bids that we had received and the marketing efforts that have done to be -- to remain effective. So we are going to have to go through that cycle again. So there have been some projects that have moved out of the current year period for their own sort of operating reasons. Paul Sankey : Great. And then the follow-up would be, would we assume that your volume target for 2017 is regardless and viable or would you see the potential for that to need to be cut as a result of low prices? Thanks. Pat Yarrington : Yeah. So, we take, Paul, the other thing I tried to mention is that, we take a long-term view on prices, because we think overtime, that\u2019s the direction, the world is still going to need our product and cost are going to rise to get access to more challenged resources. We still are on plan for the 3.1 million barrel a day production by 2017. We have a vast majority of that volume is already under construction and we can see our way to those barrels. You will recall, perhaps, that when we did put out that target back in March, we also indicated that there was about a 50,000 barrel a day cushion that we put in for the unknown and the unknowable, and so that is an opportunity there. Should some of these things move in or out of the portfolio? So some things are going to move out, some things are moving in. Jeff already talked about the strength in the Permian that we've got. So, all-in, our best view of the world right now is that 3.1 million barrel a day target is a good target for us. Paul Sankey : Thank you, Pat. Pat Yarrington : The other think I would say maybe is that, we do, when we are putting our plans together and when we are actually taking our projects to investment, we obviously, test our investments against a mid-price scenario, but a low price scenario as well as the high-priced scenario. And I would just say that the low price scenario that we use, current prices are within that band. Paul Sankey : Great. And just if I could, the credit rating is all important isn't it, that is an important way to think about how much you would borrow? Pat Yarrington : Yes. It is, credit rating is important, but we are a long way from compromising our AA status and we want to keep the AA status for exactly times like this when prices fall and we are committed on projects. Paul Sankey : Thanks. I\u2019ll let you move on. Thank you. Pat Yarrington : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from J.P. Morgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : Hi, Pat. Good morning. Pat Yarrington : Good morning. Phil Gresh : Just a follow-up on Paul's question, you talked about some of the areas of flexibility. I appreciate the color there. Specifically for 2015 you talked about the major capital projects, you talked about the Permian still being attractive, et cetera? So, I guess, I was just wondering ballpark, is there a rough amount or a range you could give us in terms of your CapEx flexibility for next year, is it 10%? Just any preliminary thoughts you could give us? Pat Yarrington : Phil, I don\u2019t really want to go down that pathway, because we are -- again, we are putting our budgets together right now. I mean, the areas that we would look to flex, exploration, it\u2019s currently been three that would probably come off some. These Phases 1 through 3 project developments that will take some declines. If -- again, if we see this price level holding. Base business and Permian activity those are obviously very economic plays at this particular point, but you could toggle those and you can toggle those without destroying value. It would mean delaying value but you wouldn\u2019t be destroying value. So those are all of the kinds of decision that we\u2019re working through at the very moment and I don't want to get ahead of our formal plan. Phil Gresh : Understood. I appreciate the additional color. My follow-up would be if we think about the levers available between the CapEx, incremental asset sales, buyback, I mean -- I guess, is it fair to say with your leverage where it is that maybe something on the CapEx and something on the asset sales would be more of a priority at this point or rank order relative to trimming the buybacks? Pat Yarrington : Yeah. Again, I don\u2019t want to get ahead on that. I think all of those avenues are open to us and it\u2019s really going to be a question of how we settle out on our longer term -- medium-to-longer term view on prices and costs. And it\u2019s also going to be a function of the economic queue that we\u2019ve got. So we will take all those parameters in place. I\u2019ll just reemphasize that we have a fair amount of leverage, a lot of leverage still available to us. So that would be taken into account as well. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your questions, please. Paul Cheng : Okay. Good morning guys. Jeff, I have -- if I could two questions, one on Duvernay, can you share with us the rationale behind the farm down? Is it because you think within your portfolio that this is not ranking as well or that it is a financial consideration? You just need the money so that you can accelerate the growth or that the development pace there. And secondly, that can you talk about from the Atlas acquisition that you also get the Utica acreage there. And relative to the Chevron portfolio, how do you rank those nine positions, does it even have any meaningful outlook on that future within your portfolio on those? Thank you. Jeff Shellebarger : Hey too good questions Paul. On the Duvernay in Canada, we are very excited about that. It\u2019s very attractive. It\u2019s less mature than the Permian but the rocks that we\u2019ve seen out there and the performance that we\u2019ve seen on exploration program are good. Chevron has been very clear about our position on risk management. We had 100% interest in more than 300,000 acres out there. Typically we look to form that down a bit. It helps us manage risk. It helps us manage across our whole portfolio. So the sell down in that particular venture was really a part of our normal risk management process. With respect to the Utica, Southwestern Pennsylvania, these are very attractive prospects. Recall four years ago, three years ago when we bought into this thing, it was primarily dry gas and that\u2019s what was driving the business. Obviously that part of our portfolio we have a lower holding cost and we pull back from that with respect to investments on the liquid rich gas side and on the deeper Utica plays. We\u2019re very excited about those. Again we\u2019re seeing the same efficiencies in the drilling and completions up there as we see everywhere else. It\u2019s completing for our capital and it\u2019s important in our portfolio. Paul Cheng : Just -- again, I just had a quick follow-up. Do you have any rig drilling in Utica? Jeff Shellebarger : Yeah. We have got one right out there. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Yeah. Good morning everybody and welcome Jeff. I will leave CapEx alone, but a modest silver lining on the low oil price is a positive PSC effect. I mean can you provide any sequential impact in 3Q and maybe just talk through what the typical timing or lag effect may be there? Jeff Gustavson : I can take that one Evan. This is Jeff Gustavson. Evan Calio : Hi Jeff. Jeff Gustavson : So we didn\u2019t see the full -- we did see a net production increase in the quarter but remember prices dropped kind of late in the quarter. So I think you see more of that in the fourth quarter assuming prices stay at the levels that they are at now. We redo our PSC sensitivity each and every year as part of our planning process. And right now these price levels what we\u2019re showing is about 1,500 barrel a day impact for dollar change in Brent prices. So that\u2019s a sensitivity you should be using going forward. I would note that this quarter and we mentioned this is in the text, we did have a couple of, maybe one-off effects, profit oil split change -- contractor versus government in Kazakhstan, that\u2019s with Karachaganak. So that was a little more of a pronounced impact, plus there was some variable royalty effects with our TCO affiliate. But going forward, 1.5 thousand barrels a day per dollar change is the sensitivity you should be using. Evan Calio : Great. Appreciate that. Maybe a question for the other, Jeff. On the Permian, you mentioned in your comments that it ranks highly. So, I presume it would be more insulated from any potential CapEx reduction and so that's correct. And then you clearly have a very large position in both basins. I didn't know if you could quantify, how much you net acreage was prospective Wolfcamp, Bone Springs or even lower Spraberry in Midland, if you had you could share that with us? Jeff Shellebarger : Yeah. Well, just to confirm really what Pat said, the Permian does rank at the high end of our investment portfolio and it should be good at the current price environment. It is good at the current price environment that we see. With respect to quantifying the acreage position, I think that\u2019s in the eye of the holder. We have a large acreage position. It\u2019s across all the different benches. Everyday, there is a new bench that looks productive out there. What I can tell you is that the areas that we are focusing on development activity are the sweet spot, as we and the industry define those things today and they are highly respected. They are highly sort out after. We started looking at the edges of that basin. Other people are out there, they're trying new technology. They are testing those benches. So, I think what we are trying to do is not get out ahead of our skies on that and follow a bit appraisal work and the delineation of these things that are going on. But we are going to stay in highly perspective areas as we pace our development programs. Evan Calio : Is that what drives your location estimates then or is that kind of all more all-encompassing? Jeff Shellebarger : The total location estimate is what we see across the basin with sort of the current and some advancement of the technologies that exists. Certainly, three years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have seen this kind of potential. Three years from now, it could be even better. Evan Calio : Yeah. It\u2019s trending that way. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please? Ed Westlake : Good morning. Can you hear me? Pat Yarrington : Hi, Ed. Yeah. Ed Westlake : Great. So I guess some of the discussion around CapEx apart from oil prices comes from the slide at the Analyst Day this year where obviously you demonstrated that cash flow was going to come on from the major projects from the work that Mike Wirth has been doing in the Downstream and then obviously the shale contribution. But CapEx was going to stay relatively high to drive growth I guess beyond and into 2020. And the shade I see is sort of it $37 billion to $40 billion which is I guess more similar to this year. So, I'm trying to get a sense of what projects you were including in that sort of 2017 timeframe. You have mentioned Kitimat, IDD, Tengiz. How much of a contribution was there in that year, if you can share that with us, so we can get a sense of where the adjusted CapEx might be? Pat Yarrington : I\u2019m not sure that I completely understand the question here. You are looking at 2017\u2026 Ed Westlake : I'm looking at how much of Kitimat and IDD and Tengiz, you were resuming in that sort of 2017 outlook that you gave us so that we can -- if they do delay not at Tengiz but Kitimat and IDD perhaps how much you would save? Pat Yarrington : Yeah. I think for all of those you would be talking about modest contributions in the 2017 time period. Yeah. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an impactful element in terms of hitting that target. Ed Westlake : Right on the CapEx side. Pat Yarrington : No, I was talking on the production side, I\u2019m sorry. So you are talking on the CapEx side. But we didn\u2019t give a 2017 target. We did show you that slide that had cash from operations growing and C&E being more contained relative to cash from operations. We still stand by that overall profile. It is our distinct content to widen out our free cash flow over time once we get into the cash generation phase of these critical projects. We\u2019ve been in this very unusual capital intensive phase with Gorgon and Wheatstone and these large projects right on the heels of under, we are coming off of that. LNG\u2019s spending this year is going to probably the peak LNG spending, $10 billion to $11 billion. It will trail off in 2015. It will trail off again in 2016. And we don\u2019t have that kind of sequential large projects queued up in the -- beyond that time period. So we\u2019ll come out with a revised target on future year C&E as best we can in March at the Analyst Day meeting. Ed Westlake : Okay. And then one for Jeff. The 20% CAGR if I calculated that right in the Permian is obviously quite impressive for any independent or major, what are the constraints? I mean, the resource is clearly there. What are the constraints on perhaps even going faster, perhaps as you get out into the second half of the decade in the Permian? Jeff Shellebarger : Okay. Well, I think the basin itself if you look back the last three years, it\u2019s certainly capable of demonstrating that growth potential. I think we are up 0.5 million, we are almost 3 million barrels a day as an industry in that basin. The constraints are what everybody talks about, it\u2019s just basic stuff like the labor force out there. That\u2019s been challenged. It\u2019s a boom time out there. Water is a area of concern for some people. We work hard on that in terms of moving from fresh water to brackish non-potable drinking water securing those supplies and the infrastructure around that. Sand has been an issue, but I think the service companies and others are starting to address that supply chain issue. I think the real uncertainty for me is just how high that activity could go and what would be the knock-on effects of that, but you got to look at, there is a lot of companies in there and the current price environment maybe some of that stabilizes out. I don\u2019t see the activity levels that we see being at risk from takeaway capacity or really the contractor\u2019s ability to deliver, and that\u2019s one thing that we take into consideration when we look at our pace of investment. Ed Westlake : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen from Cowen and Company. Your question please. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, could you update us on Kitimat? The potential timing of FID looks like at least one competing project is getting delayed. And secondly, could you update us on any labor productivity items on the West Coast of Australia in light of recent union agreement on Curtis Island? In other words, are things getting better? Jeff Shellebarger : I could give a quick update on Kitimat. I will let Pat talk about Australia. So Apache has announced their intent to fully exit the project. We are still committed to this project. We think that the low cost potentially prolific reserves up in the Liard and Horn River are going to make an attractive LNG project in time. We have been very clear that we will not take FID at this project until we have gas contract signed and we know that we have got a value adding economic project. With respect to FID, we haven\u2019t given a data on that and we continue to do the feed work on the plant, the plant site. We continue to work with the government of British Columbia. We are encouraged by the recent news that\u2019s come out of there with respect to how they want to treat LNG in taxes, but our primary focus up there is really the appraisal and the delineation work that we\u2019ve got going on in the Liard Basin. Pat Yarrington : Okay. And with regard to the union contract issue in Australia, at this point in time we know that there has been a Downstream agreement reached in-principal with certain construction unions and that it still needs to be put to a vote to the -- by the union membership. So we have agreement at the leadership level, but we still need to vote at the union member level. Frankly there is more dialogue in the press about challenges, union-related challenges for us on this project than there have been reality on the ground. So the project continues to make a good progress here. And I guess one of the exciting things that I would just mention, we didn\u2019t put it in the formal remarks, but we have secured, I guess I will call it a float-tel, I am not sure what the right hoteling accommodation nomenclature is, but we\u2019ve got the capacity over the next several weeks to bring overtime about 1200 additional workers to the island to work on the MEI work, that\u2019s underway that needs to be done in the next year. So that\u2019s a good boost we think in productivity for that. Asit Sen : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from BMO. Your question please. Iain Reid : Hi, there. Pat, I wonder if you could give me an update on the Wheatstone budget. It\u2019s I think about 49% through now in terms of spend. Is it time now that we get a kind of a complete updates in terms of how much that project is going to cost? Pat Yarrington : Right. I mean at this point. Yes, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re about 49% complete. It is a typical process for us to go through and do a mid project to update. I don\u2019t have a specific calendar date for that but it would be a reasonable thing that we would do anytime between 40% and 60% when the project is done. So I would say, that\u2019s coming but I don\u2019t have a specific date as to when that will be completed. Iain Reid : Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on another big international asset, Angola LNG. Can you give us a kind of cost to repair and some schedule for re-startup of that project? Pat Yarrington : Sure. I can talk a little bit about the schedule side of things but there is not a cost estimate that I am available -- that I have available to give to you. Let me just make sure, we are just a 36% partner in a consortium here. We are not a controlling entity to work through the partnership there. But in terms of the progress on the repair work, we continue to make good progress there. We do at this point anticipate an initial restart somewhere around the middle of 2015. And after initial performance testing as it is typical that plant will go down. For a couple of month period of time where we clean out and remove the strainer, clean out the filter et cetera, then it will be brought back online. And we anticipate restarting and working towards sustained production levels late in 2015. Jeff Shellebarger : Did that answer your question? Iain Reid : Yeah. No, it did. Thank you. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Thank you. All right. I\u2019ll guess, we\u2019ll take the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question please. Allen Good : Good morning, everyone. A couple on the Permian. First of all, when you look around you benchmark yourself against maybe some of your smaller peers there on operating costs and other efficiency metrics. How do you see yourself backing up? And then secondly, on the new projections for growth, would it be -- does it imply a commensurate step-up in spending as well or have you been able to achieve some capital efficiency improvements from your initial projections that suggest that spending won't quite increase as much as the production is? Jeff Shellebarger : Yeah. Good questions. We benchmark ourselves all the time. We benchmark ourselves with respect to cost efficiency, or finding the development cost et cetera, et cetera. A year and a half ago, we were probably down at the lower end of our competition, part of that was because we were new in the basin and part of that was because we were focused on the appraisal in some of the other work to really understand what's going on in the basin and these new areas. And we made a concentrated effort in that area over the last 14 to 16 months. We\u2019ve made significant improvement in our execution efficiency, our cost-efficiency. Today, I would say, we\u2019re probably in the mid-upper part of the second quartile. Our performance targets here to be the top of the heat there and we\u2019re making very, very good progress on getting there. With respect to how we\u2019re improving and what's going on there, I mean, it\u2019s really a host of thing. Certainly, we are seeing capital efficiency in what we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019ve been able to drill more wells with the same amount of money. We\u2019re seeing efficiencies in our completion. But I think, even more important to that moving to horizontal wells, moving to longer lateral length, moving to more stages, our acreage position allows us to do that and we\u2019re going to see more of an impact on that in our production forecast than probably anything else. Allen Good : Hey, great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. Was the Duvernay sell down, was that included in the original $10 billion estimate of asset sales and then is there any potential upside for that figure over the next couple years? Pat Yarrington : Yes. So we wouldn\u2019t really talk to what included or excluded in our overall target. Obviously, it\u2019s a significant component there. And in terms of future, I think your second question was is there future effort in that regard? I think that\u2019s \u2026. Allen Good : I mean, do you think there is -- I'm sorry. Is there upside to that $10 billion figure? Now that you've gone through it a little bit and progressed through do you see upside from your initial estimate? Pat Yarrington : So I think, that\u2019s going to be a function of what the market is going to allow. We have certain assets which we\u2019ve tried to describe that are either early in life or late in life. We know what those assets are and we\u2019ll as I said only go for the sales when we can get good value. So it will be a function of what the market will look forward at that point in time. But we\u2019re on track for the $10 billion. We can see our way to that almost at this point in time. Certainly this year 2014 or maybe there will be some slippage into first quarter 2015 of some of the transactions that I\u2019ve line of sight on. But I feel very good about what we fit at this point in time. Allen Good : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones on LNG. First in relation to Kitimat. With the tax announcement from the BC government earlier this month, is that still a hurdle or are you pretty satisfied with how that went? Jeff Shellebarger : Well, that\u2019s just one element of our investment decision. I think that what we\u2019re satisfied with is that the British Colombia Government is very attentive to the realities of the industry. They\u2019ve listened to what we\u2019ve said. They listened to what the buyers have said. And I think they\u2019ve made some very good moves in terms of what reality is out there and what it takes to make these projects economic. I mean, there are -- we\u2019ve got to work a whole lot of other issues between now and FID. And I think they'll remain. Our view is that they will continue to remain flexible in those discussions. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. And then you mentioned you want to sign offtakes for Kitimat before FID, but you also have some remaining capacity at Gorgon, which as I understand is still not covered by offtake. Are you prioritizing one versus the other if a particular customer is open to either option? Pat Yarrington : Well, I think the fundamental driver there is that the volumes would be available under different time frame. I mean Gorgon production starts in a year from now and ramps up with three trains over the subsequent years. Kitimat was going to be in a much longer term horizon there. Just speaking to the Gorgon unallocated volumes or uncontracted volume at this point time, yes, we are sitting at about 65%. We did have notionally some of that volume earmarked for as a backstop behind IDD from a customer arrangement standpoint. Now that the Indonesian deepwater is no longer going forward on that same development time plan, we are available to take some of those volumes that we had earmarked there and market them. And that\u2019s exactly what we're doing now. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. That\u2019s useful. I appreciate it. Pat Yarrington : Okay. So I think that ends our queue at this particular point in time. So I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your interest in Chevron and your participation with questions. We wish you a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathon and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead. John Watson : Well, thanks Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Gustavson, the General Manager of Investor Relations. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on our Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, I'd like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the year, starting with safety environmental performance. We had our best year ever and virtually every measure of personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. We expect to lead the industry again. Although commodities prices fell sharply late in the year, our overall financial performance was strong, upstream and downstream had solid years overall and both ended the year with very good reliability. We had excellent progress on our asset divestment program with significant well-timed upstream sales in Chad and in Canada and high valuation mid-stream transactions. In the first year of the program we finalized just under $6 billion in investments versus the $10 billion three year target for the period 2014 to 2016, we'll update this target at our March meeting. Looking at our downstream business, we completed important liability investments at several of our key refineries, which contributed to high utilization rates in the second half of the year. We became the world's largest premium base oil producer with the start-up of a 25,000 barrel per day plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. We continued to make progress on our U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project through Chevron Phillips Chemical Company our 50% owned affiliate. It is now 50% complete. Moving to the upstream business, we started Jack/St. Malo which is ramping up ahead of plan and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. In Bangladesh we successfully expanded production at the Bibiyana field. On our LNG projects in Australia, Gorgon is now 90% complete, we're targeting first gas into the system around the middle of the year and first LNG sales this year. Wheatstone made excellent progress and it's 55% complete and on-track for late 2016 start-up. We've posted a number of photos highlighting our construction progress on these two important projects on our investor webpage. We progressed development of our shale and tight resource holdings, notably in the Permian. We had one of our best years from an exploration and resource capture standpoint with 35 discoveries at a 66% success rate. We added 1.4 billion oil equivalent barrels with significant conventional and unconventional adds. We had two potential hub class discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we announced the transaction yesterday to consolidate holdings around one of them. Our one year reserve replacement ratio was 89% taking our five year replacement ratio to 96%. With that I'll turn it over to Pat, who'll take you through our financial results. Pat? Pat Yarrington : All right, thanks John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance, the Company's fourth quarter earnings were $3.5 billion or $1.85 per diluted share. For the year earnings were 19.2 billion this equates to a $10.14 per diluted share. Return on capital employed was 11% and our debt ratio at year-end was 15%. 2014 marked the 27th consecutive that we\u2019ve increased our dividend payment. Given the change in market conditions, we are suspending our share repurchase program for 2015. Turning to Slide 5, cash generated from operations was 6.5 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash from operations totaled 31.5 billion. Cash capital expenditures were 9.7 billion for the quarter and 35.4 billion for the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $13 billion giving us a net debt position of about 15 billion. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2014 earnings were approximately $1.5 billion lower than fourth quarter 2013 result. Upstream earnings decreased to 2.2 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations and asset impairments driven by the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the second half of the year and higher DD&A charges were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and lower exploration expenses. Downstream results increased by 1.1 billion driven by stronger international refining and marketing margins, higher gains on asset sales and favorable timing effects. The decrease in the other segment primarily reflected higher corporate charges and tax items. Turning to Slide 7, I'll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2014 with the third quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.1 billion lower than third quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately 2 billion reflecting lower realizations and asset impairments partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and more favorable foreign exchange effect. Downstream earnings increased by 130 million driven by favorable timing effects and gains on asset sales partially offset by higher operating expenses and a one-time economic buyout of a legacy pension obligation. The decrease in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges. Moving to Slide 8, our U.S. upstream earnings for both the fourth quarter were about 500 million lower than third quarter results. Lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by 600 million consistent with the approximate 25% decline in the U.S. liquids prices indicators between periods. The decline in prices also triggered impairments of several smaller assets which negatively affected earnings by 90 million. Higher gains on asset sales improved earnings by 160 million. The other bar reflects the number of unrelated items including unfavorable tax effects which were more than offset by the absence of the economic buyout of a long-term contractual transportation obligation in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 9, international upstream earnings were about 1.5 billion lower than last quarter's results. Lower crude oil prices negatively impacted earnings by $1.4 billion. Our average international crude oil realizations were down $25 per barrel between quarters consistent with the decline in Brent prices. The significant drop in prices triggered impairment for several late-in-life assets decreasing earnings by 570 million between periods. Higher operating cost reduced earnings by 110 million. Gains on asset sales increased earnings by 670 million, mainly driven by the farm-down of a 30% interest in our Duvernay shale interest in Canada as well as the sale of our upstream business in the Netherlands. Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 14,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects start ups and growth from shale and tight resource developments contributed 13,000 barrels per day. Project start-ups included the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh as well as the start up of Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo achieved first production in December on-time and on-budget. Entitlement effects increased production by 13,000 barrels per day between the quarters. Lower crude prices increased volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts partially offset by lower cost recovery volumes. Higher plant turnaround activity at TCO's Tengiz SGI/SGP facility in Kazakhstan early in the quarter and turnaround activity in Thailand and in Australia decreased production by 19,000 barrels per day. Asset sales in the Netherlands, South Texas and Norway negatively affected production by 11,000 barrels per day between quarters. The increase of 18,000 barrels per day in the base business in other bar reflects primarily higher reliability from Tengiz following the previously mentioned turnarounds completed earlier in the quarter. Slide 11 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between 2014 and 2013. Net production declined by 26,000 barrels per day during 2014 compared to the prior year. Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels per day driven primarily by growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian as well as the Vaca Muerta in Argentina. Ramp up associated with Papa-Terra in Brazil and the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 13,000 barrels per day. Production entitlement effects decreased production by 14,000 barrels per day. Price effects were positive due to the decrease in crude oil prices of almost $10 per barrel between years. This were more than offset however by negative entitlement effects in Kazakhstan and lower cost recovery volumes in Bangladesh and Indonesia. Assets sales decreased production by 12,000 barrels a day due primarily to the sale of our Chad asset earlier in the year. The base business in other bar principally reflects normal field declines partially offset by base business investments in Nigeria, in the San Joaquin Valley and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate of less than 3% per year. Turning to Slide 12, U.S. downstream results increased $80 million between quarters. Realized margins decreased earnings by 190 million. Refining margins were weaker on both the West and the Gulf Coast as the decrease in product prices outpaced the decline in crude oil prices. This reflected abundant supply, high inventories and lower seasonal demand. Timing effects represented $195 million improvement in earnings between the quarters largely driven by year-end inventory effects and marking to market on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. Higher gains on mid-stream asset sales improved earnings by 210 million. The other bar consists of several unrelated items mainly unfavorable tax effects and higher operating expenses primarily associated with planned shutdown activity. Turning to Slide 13, international downstream earnings increased by $51 million between quarters. Higher margins particularly in Asia increased earnings by 280 million. Refining margins benefited from falling crude prices while marketing margins were supported by favorable price lag effects for naphtha and jet fuel. Inventory effects represented $100 million improvement in earnings between quarters mostly reflecting favorable year-end LIFO impacts. A one-time charge related to the buyout of a legacy pension liability decreased earnings by 160 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects. With that I'll turn it back to John for a few comments on 2015. John Watson : Okay, thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 14, earlier today we announced the $35 billion capital program for 2015. This is $5 million or 13% lower than last year, excluding expenditures by affiliates the cash component of this program is 31 billion. This program is lower than we signaled last March and is responsive to current market conditions. It funds key projects where we've taken final investment decision and are already under construction. In the upstream this amount is approximately $14 billion representative of the dark blue on this chart. It includes monies for Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot and others. This category of spend will decline in the future as projects are completed. Base business and shale spending in medium blue on the chart is about 12 billion. A portion of this base business spend includes critical and maintenance reliability work which has limited flexibility. The majority of the base spend, including shale and tight is being screened at current prices. We have increasing flexibility in this component of spend as the year progresses. Spending on Pre-FID projects and exploration work is being high graded, paced and significantly reduced in response to market conditions. Downstream spending of $3 billion is limited to key projects under construction such as the Gulf Coast chemical project which by the way is 35% complete I think I said 50% earlier, 35% complete. And also the spending in the downstream is also limited to critical reliability and maintenance work. Turning to Slide 15 we've reduced our capital budget for the year conserving cash and preserving value. We also are reducing the costs of goods and services and operating expenses. We enter this period of lower prices with a very competitive cost structure. We routinely show you a chart that tracks total cost per barrel in our upstream business relative to our competitors. You've seen we are industry-leader and we have significant cost reduction efforts underway. This chart shows the IHS upstream cost index, industry costs have more than doubled in the last decade. Market conditions will create surplus capacity in most key supply chain categories and drive rates lower. We are actively engaged with all suppliers and have enjoyed early success. We expect the opportunity will grow with time and particularly so if prices remain low. We're also taking action to reduce internal costs. You may have seen press coverage of staffing adjustments in the UK and Pennsylvania. We have other reviews under way in multiple other operating and corporate units. Managing cost aggressively is not new to us Mike Wirth was quite successful in making significant reductions in the downstream in recent years and if you go back and look at our financial statements in 2008 and 2009, you'll see that we took operating and administrative cost down $4 billion or about 15% between years in response to that brief price excursion. We know how to manage costs. Our production guidance is the range of flat to 3% growth the uncertainty is the reflection of market conditions. I'll highlight several of those uncertainties. First, we've had great success in the base business area limiting decline in mature fields to 3% or less in many years. Our shale programs in the Permian and elsewhere continued, but I have indicated we're screening the spend at current prices. I have also indicated we're active in our efforts with vendors and suppliers to reduce costs. The uncertainty in prices and the costs of goods and services creates some uncertainty in the amount of base business investment and the decline rate and growth from our shale resources. Second, we've had success in our asset sale program. The full year effect of last year's sales reduces production 22,000 barrels a day from 2014. There is uncertainty in the timing and precise composition of this year's asset sale program creating uncertainty in the additional volume impact. Remember we're driven on all sales by value and this can influence timing. Finally, the contributions from major capital project ramp ups and start ups this year is significant but relatively small movement in the timing of deepwater development wells at Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells or Papa-Terra can make a significant difference in annual production. Similarly, small movements in restart dates for Angola LNG or start up of Gorgon and other new projects can cause variation. Finally, production sharing contract and other entitlement effects are sensitive to prices and spend levels. Our 3.1 million barrel a day target for 2017 remains on-track as the major projects under construction drive that outcome. That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate your listening in this morning we're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan please open up the lines and we will take some questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : John, I just want to ask about taking FID in the current price environment. You spoke about how you were beginning to see cost savings from your providers and is that something where you would probably just try to delay making an FID to see how that type of negotiation goes with suppliers, or do you expect that you will actually have some fairly significant FIDs this year? And I am really thinking Tengiz\u2019s expansion as much as anything else here? John Watson : And I think that's the key one to focus on, if you look -- we have many projects that are in concept development and frontend engineering and design. And so the overall economics of some of them are impacted by the current price environment but the project at Tengiz is a good project and that project will ultimately go forward. And we've made significant progress and have good line up with our partners on that. But we're taking the opportunity in the current price environment to take a look at contracts, take a look at spend and see if we can bring costs down further. Now we have in the plan and expectation that we will take final investment decision later in the year in 2015. Other than that I can't think of too many significant projects where we're likely to take FID this year. Jason Gammel : And then just as a follow-up, John do you have any deflation built into the capital budget for 2015 or is it all reduced activity levels? John Watson : Well it's a little bit of both Jason, we do have -- I think for example we've dropped over 20 rigs, which is about 15% of our worldwide rig count. So as I said we're screening projects based on the current level of prices if the return is near at hand. So if you have short cycle based business or shale investments and they don't meet investment hurdles at current prices which is the revenue you're likely to realize, we're pulling them from the program and we've cut rigs all over the world. Now many things continue to pass the hurdle and so we\u2019re continuing with our development. For example our work in the Permian passes is the hurdle. And so we're continuing that and have had good success. But we're also taking on costs in a fairly big way, if you look around the world. Rigs get a lot of attention, but that's actually not the biggest category of spend. EPC cost, well construction services, transportation, the fab yards are going to empty out here and rigs. We're taking on all of these things and we have a centralized procurement organization as well as a lot of people in our unit that are taking advantage of the opportunity in spare capacity and the supply chain. It varies considerably depending upon the category of spend that we're talking about and the precise timing. On rigs, we had one offer in one location around the world of a 50% reduction in rig rate. We've already captured retroactive January 1, rig reductions in some areas. So we're taking this on a big way and we have targets. We've baked in a little bit into our numbers but this is a very fast moving market and the longer this downturn persists the more we\u2019re likely to capture and the more it will be reflected in the major categories of spend like EPC cost and major fab yard spending that we might make on projects. Sure. Sir, Ed Westlake. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake : John, so I mean, just the high level picture and yes-no answer probably, has anything changed to your view that oil demand is growing? And has anything changed about the decline rates that you feel the industry has to overcome? John Watson : Yes. Overall the general picture that I've laid out here before and we've talked about is that, as long as the world economy grows, there's a reasonable correlation between world economic growth and growth in energy demand. If the world economy grows 3% to 4%, we tend to see 1% to 2% growth in energy consumption. In our view, maybe 1% for oil, 2% for gas over that time period, so that general picture hasn\u2019t changed. Now it can be influenced in the short run by macro events and prices and things of that sort. One of the things that we're trying to get a handle on and that others are looking at is how responsive will global demand be to the price reduction. If you look at some of those who follows very closely, they could see increases from 3,000 to 5,000 barrels a day from lower prices, but you've also got countries around the world that are reducing demand side subsidies and things of that sort. So it's a function of economics and it depends how long this persists. Truck sales in the U.S. are doing pretty well right now, so I think we get a bump from lower prices and I think we'll see growth of perhaps a 1 million barrels a day in demand worldwide in 2015, but that number can move around a little bit. Ed Westlake : And then specifically Gorgon, you've kind of reiterated the timetable I mean can you give us any nuggets to give you confidence that we will get that first gas in Gorgon mid-year and the first LNG cargo this year? John Watson : Well I'd tell you that there's nothing at the higher priority for us right now than that Ed. And as I said we're 90% complete. We've got 8,000 people on the site right now, that's a little more than we might have thought in the past. We've brought in a bigger combination vessel and so we have put more people on site. We've made terrific progress on the upstream side basically all 18 wells have been drilled all upstream subsea infrastructure is in place, pipeline installation is complete. You can see a lot of this on the Web site, so those things are good. So we're working all those things really hard. We've got really mechanical electrical instrumentation work that's in high gear right now and we're basically milestone driven and commissioning and starting up systems right now. And that's really our focus. We're monitoring very closely contractor performance and productivity on the Island we're working with the unions on contracts and industrial relations. We've been able to manage through those things fairly well and we're planning for a flawless start up commissioning and start-up process. We've got risks of adverse weather that are there, but look we're shooting to get gas into the system in the middle of the year timeframe and get some cargos out this year. That's our focus. George and Jay Johnson are heading down there here in February so when we come back in March at the Analyst Meeting we'll have some very fresh information for you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please. Alastair Syme : Can I just come back to the chat on CapEx, I'm just trying to get a feel for how the different buckets of CapEx are moving year on year so the base business and the projects under construction, where the big revisions are? John Watson : Spending has come down $5 billion overall some of that is in LNG spend. It was a little over $10 billion in 2014 in total, it's a little over $8 billion planned in 2015, so that's a little bit of the spend. Deepwater spend is relatively flat. Shale and tight spend is a little bit higher, but some of our other base business spend is down. We've got about 10% to 15% reduction in exploration expense between years. And of course we also have those mid cycle projects those that are in concept design or engineering that there are fewer of those there's little less spend in those categories this year than in the past, so we're working very hard on all of those costs. And of course you may be asking about how do those categories look going forward? And we do expect growing flexibility in our spend as we move forward. One of the things we'll show you in March when we get there is that that bottom bar those projects under construction the $14 billion that number comes down in time. The LNG spend this year and next will continue to be significant, but as we get to 2017 it\u2019s under $100 billion, so I expect you'll see some reduction in that category. Now we may take FID on some projects, so you may have some additional spend in that category, but in principal there's a very high roll-off rate from that category of projects under construction. The base business spend is a function of both economics and how much we can wring out of the system from a cost point of view so there's activity and there is the cost of that activity and I commented on some of the sort of trends that we're seeing in that category. I will say exploration we're going to continue to explore. We had fabulous success particularly towards the end of 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico where the couple of discoveries and the transaction we had with a couple of other players in the business. So we'll continue to high grade that activity but we have growing flexibility in all categories is I guess the comment I\u2019d like to leave you with. Alastair Syme : Could you give us some sort of sense of about as you droll down that base versus payments in 2015, what impact that might have on underlying decline rates in the business? John Watson : Yes I think that it is a risk for the industry I think I've commented earlier I think that is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to 2008 and 2009 period and this is a hard number to get at but we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry. Increase by a 1% or 2% and that\u2019s very significant. We've done a good job of keeping decline rates to 3% or less I think we\u2019ve got a good chance to do that but obviously when you cut some rigs you have some risk of a higher decline rate in 2015 relative to past years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : My question is just to follow-up on CapEx and I appreciate that it is a fluid process yet on your current guidance today, where do you expect the production impact? I mean it doesn't appear to impact the guide for 2015 at least in the high-end? I mean is it altering that 2017 guide or is it really much more long dated impact given being in a longer cycle time of a lot of your resource? John Watson : Yes Evan you just said the impact is predominantly over the longer term because we're continuing with the projects under construction and we're deferring some projects and spend that will have some impact on production but it's generally outside the window the window that we're talking about. For example the Tengiz project will be a good project but it\u2019s not going produce volumes inside the 2017 window. Similarly when you cut make reductions in exploration spend you're not going impact a production inside the window. So I would think of most of it as being a long dated impact. Evan Calio : And the 3%, the \u201915 production guidance, that's on current prices, I presume? Assuming no asset sales is I guess how I read the sensitivity. Obviously there is PSC effect there in asset sales? Is that correct? That is based on current prices, current strip? John Watson : It is I think it really governs the full range it's a pretty good range frankly normally we've given point estimates but there are a lot of moving categories this time. So it really encompasses the range of outcomes that are possible based on where we are today. For example as you point out at lower prices you do get a benefit in some of our PSC agreements from those lower prices where you spend money it takes more barrels to repay cost for example on cost barrels. But the flip side is that you may spend less and so there will be less to recover for example, we are reducing spend and have cut some rigs in Indonesia in response to economic. So you do have some offsets in these categories and of course depending upon when you make asset sales that has a direct impact on volumes. Evan Calio : And just a follow-up if I could, you mentioned you continue to monitor and be responsive to market conditions so I presume that further cuts would be responsive to a deterioration in market conditions. And then I guess you gave -- I like the classification on Slide 14. I guess how much of the $12 billion base is being spent in \u201915 on shorter cycle that may be more controllable if conditions warranted? John Watson : Well virtually everything in that category is shorter cycle activity there are some critical maintenance and reliability investments that we will continue to make same thing in the downstream. You need to keep your facilities running and in good shape. So there is a category that I would say is inflexible that is in the base business. Although the cost of delivering those goods and services may go down during the period, the activity itself will continue from an activity point of view as time goes by and rig contracts roll off we have growing flexibility in this category. I mean ultimately you have a great deal of flexibility in this category of spend. But as I say and we'll be responsive to market conditions and screen activity out if it doesn\u2019t meet our thresholds. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Ryan Todd : If I could follow-up with a question on pricing in the current environment, between the changes in the LNG market that we've seen in terms of where LNG is coming from in particular potentially a ramp in U.S. supply and then the reduction, the collapse that we've seen in oil price, are you seeing anything in potential LNG market pricing either for existing projects or for future projects, any change in the trends? John Watson : Any change in trends, well the trend has been a very fluid environment and a very frankly there has been a lot pressure on LNG pricing both in response to immediate conditions and response to the projects that have gone to FID around the world. So there is pressure on LNG markets. Notwithstanding that, we did signed a contract during this period that's an oil linked contract with a reputable company for a medium term slice of volume towards the end of the decade which gets us up into the range where we feel pretty good about the projects Gorgon and Wheatstone where we will basically be at our target for sales will be between 75% and 80% on Gorgon and 85% for Wheatstone. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good shape. We obviously need good contracts that to underpin new developments. So one of the projects that we\u2019re pacing until we can see conditions that will support a project is at Kitimat in Canada, we\u2019re continuing with some of the work we have underway to delineate the resource and reach agreements with First Nations people and permitting and things of that sort. But we\u2019re significantly pacing the spend of that project and we\u2019ll get alignment on it and have good alignment in early days with Woodside which is replaced Apache. Other than that I think there is, I think people are pretty cautious right now in the LNG market. Our view is it\u2019s not clear that all the Greenfield projects that are being contemplated can meet economic hurdles at some of the prices we\u2019re seeing. And demand is out there. Ryan Todd : Maybe speaking of Kitimat, that's a good transition to a second question, which is from a high-level strategic view, when you look out from here over the next 10 years, has your view of the future changed at all in the sense that when you look back I guess over the last 10, are there projects, business models, efforts that have been part of your business model in the last five to 10 years that when you look forward over the next 10 you think just may not work anymore whether it's large-scale gas projects or oil sands or any type of -- I guess your views at high level on changes in the industry over the next 10 versus the last 10? John Watson : My basic view that in fact was referenced in the question which was asked earlier is energy demand continues to grow and if you look at the decline curve that\u2019s inherent in our business and let\u2019s talk about the oil side for a moment. Oil fields decline worldwide roughly 15% a year without investment. The industry works very hard with base business investments to attenuate that decline every year but still you do get declines of 3% to 5% industry-wide. So you need new oil fields to meet demand. The 3% to 5% decline on 90 plus million barrel a day base is significant. So you need investments in new fields and $50 does not support large new field developments and what I would call the big volumes that are going to contribute to meeting demand whether it\u2019s oil sands, deepwater aren\u2019t supportive of the 50 bucks. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing forward prices and most in the industry expecting to see some rebound in prices because we simply won\u2019t be able to support those projects at those kinds of prices. Now there in the short run when you have supply that is exceeding demand in our business short run supply and demand are not very responsive to prices so it takes that decline kicking in or action by OPEC or a stronger economic growth to close that gap and that\u2019s what it will be required here over the next period of time to get prices into a range where they can support the sorts of projects that you\u2019re referencing. Our view is those forces are at work right now and we can debate when that gap will close but the forces are working with every announcement of C&E cuts it\u2019s more likely to happen sooner. So my basic view is the world needs energy and the prices have to support the activity and of course we monitor the cost environment that we\u2019re in. We can see short run reductions in costs that can make projects more economic but in general the projects that are going to meet demand going forward are more complex than 20 or 30 years ago and so the cost of those projects will be higher and require higher price than we\u2019re seeing today to meet the volume targets. Probably a long explanation but that\u2019s how we think of it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Cheng : John, often times that risks also come opportunity and especially that you foresee maybe longer that potentially that you could have distressed assets out there in the U.S. and maybe also overseas. So from a high level, how do you guys look at under that circumstances I mean how much are you willing to use your balance sheet or perhaps that risk in your balance sheet a little bit and also that to use perhaps your currency not necessary at the best point that you want but will you be willing to also use it in a decent sized transaction? John Watson : Well, we -- old times Paul you and I've talked many times over the years, we're a depleting resource business, so we have to acquire leases discovered resource and frankly companies overtime. And we're very targeted in how we do that and we have tried to be commercially smart and take advantage of the opportunities when there's less competition for those assets. So we are actively screening the opportunities that are out there and we'll take advantage of opportunities that we see, I mean a one that's on the smaller end of the scale, but just a couple of days ago we did announce a consolidating transaction in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a couple of partners. And we think we've acquired resource at a competitive cost relative to exploration costs and so -- and there are benefits to all parties from working to develop a common set of assets together in one hub, but that's -- so we do take a look at the opportunities that are before us. Now I have to tell you, our priority right now isn\u2019t acquisitions. Our priority at the moment is completing the projects that are under construction. And we do have balance sheet parameters that we work within to do that, but you point out on a relative basis, we've got a pretty good currency and we're mindful of the opportunities that's there. Paul Cheng : Can I just follow-on a quick question, that in your supply costs, any rough idea of what is the percent of your supply contract whether it is rig EPC, those have a duration longer than two years. So in other words what is the percentage of your cost base both in capital and operating costs that potentially we could see the benefit from the deflationary environment that expecting over the next 12 to 18 months? John Watson : We have a number of contracts that roll-off during that period. I would say by the time you get to 2017, almost all spend becomes variable if you will, so in fact a lot of it this year rolls off. Now we do have deepwater rig contracts that have been staggered and go out a few years. We do have fabrication contracts that have already been led they can go out several years, but the vast majority of the spend going forward if you look out to say 2017, the vast majority of that spend will be reflective of current market conditions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Paul Sankey : John, from this level are you saying that you expect CapEx to go lower and do we now say that the 3.1 million barrel a day 2017 target for volumes is gone? And one query I would have about that is it was previously lowered because of an assumption that oil prices would be higher. If you recall your previous planning assumption had been I think $79 and it was the move up to a higher price that caused you to lower the target. Wouldn't that be a reverse effect down here? Thanks. John Watson : Yes well I did reaffirm the 3.1 in my comments earlier, so I have reaffirmed that target. And I will say there are quite a few moving parts in getting to the 3.1. First, most of the growth between now and then in underpinned by Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Mafumeira Sul and others that are under construction. And I've indicated we're continuing to fund that spending. We have had over the years some changes in the composition of the remainder of the volumes that contribute to the 3.1 for example, we've previously flagged in response to U.S. gas prices, we had reduced spend in that area. On the other side, the Permian wasn\u2019t in our plans when you go way back to 2010 and volumes coming from that area or higher. There has been a big change in prices and price effects as I indicated earlier can impact volumes. Other things being equal there is a contribution if we get to 2017 and prices are much lower, there will be a positive contribution that's inherent in that 3.1. The other side as I also commented is that we have fewer -- we have less impact from that, if our spend goes down in places like Indonesia and finally we have asset sales that can influence that target, but as we see it today with all those effects some that are positive some that are negative, we still see that 3.1 target. Paul Sankey : John, just I guess what I am driving at is that based on the 35 would you think you could come lower on the 35 billion of spending and still make the 3.1 and would you manage towards the 3.1, is that what you are saying because I guess you do have a view\u2026 John Watson : No that's specifically not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we have always -- the volume has always been an outcome. It's always been an outcome. We make decision based on economics. What I'm telling you is that I see the outcome being 3.1 because 80% to 90% of the volume increase between now and then are the projects that are under construction. And we make the investment decisions on our best view of go forward economics and in response to the best value propositions that we can see. The precise level of spend going forward the only thing I'll flag as you know I've been reticent to talk about C&E going forward and this last year is a perfect illustration as to why. We have a lot of moving parts many of which I have described. We also have currency movements and uncertainties, we have growing flexibility in our spend going forward. And if the kind of price environments we see the day persists you will see lower spending absolutely. Paul Sankey : I mean guess what I was driving at is that you had previously guided towards the flat CapEx from the previous 40 level in order to meet the 3.1. I think what you're now saying is you can still meet the 3.1 and we could even then still see lower CapEx again in meeting the 3.1. Or do I think about it that you are potentially not going to meet the 3.1 and bring down CapEx appropriately with the oil price? John Watson : I think the outcome is a function of spend that is largely already committed as one of the questions earlier commented is there much volume effect for some of the cuts most of the volume effect will be after 2017 because there are these longer cycle projects where we're taking a pause and trying to work the costs spend. So you know very well Paul we are in a long cycle business and so if you defer longer term projects now it will mean lower production than you might otherwise have seen beyond the target date of 2017. So there is an impact beyond 2017 of the decisions that we're making today but because we have all these projects in flight we don\u2019t see a significant impact to our target beyond the fact as I talked about before of base business spend, timing of asset sales and quantity of assets sales cost barrel effects and things of that sort. Paul Sankey : And a very quick one, could you indicate how high you think that can go in order to then allow you still to maintain your targeted credit rating? Thanks. John Watson : I'm going to let my CFO talk about the balance sheet and credit ratings. Pat Yarrington : Yes, and Paul we have a lot of borrowing capacity still available to us we ended the year with a 15% debt ratio and there is a lot of appetite in the capital markets for our debt and under the scenarios that we're talking about here in this price range with this capital program we anticipate still being very nicely within the double A band and after you get through 2015 really and you look ahead obviously we're going see more production growth. John talked about the flexibility that we've got as time rolls on with our capital program we talked about and we do believe that there will some recovery in oil price we don\u2019t know at what level or exactly how quickly and there will be adjustments to our cost structure. So we feel very comfortable with the position that we're in and John referenced earlier managing within certain constraints and one of the balance sheet constraint is maintaining a strong AA. Paul Sankey : Is there a rule of thumb for how much that you can have and still be AA? PatYarrington: I don\u2019t think there is rule of thumb because the rating agencies take into account not only what your financial parameters are but also what's your operating parameters are and what's your prospects for future cash flow generation really are, so it's a combination of what the overall business plan so to speak for the enterprises if the rating agencies take into account. But suffice it to say we have incremental borrowing capacity of several-several 10s of billions of dollars there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : First question is just kind of following up. In terms of trying to achieve dividend coverage and how you think about when you can get there full 100% dividend coverage, any color you can provide about how you kind of bridge to that? Because it looks like this year kind of the shortfall in the free cash flow and then the dividend, you add that up it's maybe $15 billion to $20 billion, so anything you could n provide around that. It sounds like operating costs you've highlighted maybe $4 billion of opportunity but just generally how you are thinking about that? John Watson : Sure, our plan is to cover the dividend in 2017. And we won't do it this year in all likelihood and in fact we flagged that if you go back two or three years or three to four years we have said in fact it was in response to questions around our balance sheet at that time where we had more cash than debt on the balance sheet and a lot of you were encouraging us to repurchase more shares and to really take advantage of the lower cost of debt and we said look our primary case may not be falling oil price. But we've got a lot of projects under construction and we're in a commodity business and we need to be able withstand the ups and downs of our business and so what I said at that time is that we would be restoring our balance sheet to something that might be a more normal level for AA credit rating as time goes by and these projects roll off. So when you get the reason I say 2017 is our production will grow between now and then by about 20% and so at whatever price level we're at we'll see benefits to free cash flow from that I have talked about the flexibility in the activity level that we have which can moderate spend and bring us back into balance. And then of course as you mentioned the cost reduction efforts that we have underway both in the supply chain and internally will help us attenuate that. Finally bridging us and helping us on the balance sheet are the contributions from assets sales and you saw we got off to a pretty good start in the program this year but we've flagged and indicated that even at higher price that we were going to use our balance sheet and we were going to use a little of it this year than perhaps would have been the case with higher prices but we\u2019re able to attenuate that over a couple of years. Phil Gresh : So just a clarification on that then, with the strip in the low 60s is it fair to say that your production growth later in the strip take out 4 billion cost you would actually plug the CapEx to get to a level that carries within that? John Watson : I\u2019m not going to give you a specific price forecast, I\u2019ll just say that the boundary conditions that we\u2019re operating under and these are things Pat has talked to you many times the boundary conditions, the dividend is the highest priority of spend for us and we want to keep sufficient flexibility on our balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in the commodity market. So we will work very hard on CapEx and OpEx in order to get balanced in a couple of years. Phil Gresh : Okay. And just my follow-up question, is there anything in the production guidance for 2015 for Gorgon and for Angola LNG at this point or would execution on that timing wise be upside to the guidance just how to think about and the update on the Angola LNG in general? John Watson : Well, there is a scenario where we can be to the upside of the range that we\u2019ve indicated, but frankly I\u2019m a little gun-shy on that sort of thing given the kind of the operating environment that we\u2019re in right now given oil prices are and potential adjustments to spend. So yes, we expect to see volumes from those assets this year. The exact timing brings in some variability but our plan is to have both of those contributing volumes this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question please. Iain Reid : Just a question about your onshore drilling activity, you seem to be maintaining or increasing your drilling in the Permian whereas some of the other companies seem to be deferring it on the basis that it will be worth more in a couple years time by leaving it in the ground. Just kind of interested in your take on that versus what you are planning? John Watson : Well, we have about 30 rigs running in the Permian and we continue to screen the economics of both I think what I said is our spend on unconventionals will be, in shale will be higher this year than last. But that encompasses our worldwide activity that we expect to see. So we\u2019re still, by the way we\u2019ve had some terrific performance in the Permian, and part of the reason we\u2019re able to do that is we\u2019ve been able to dramatically reduce cost. When we get ahead to March at our Analyst Meeting we\u2019ll give you a fair amount of information on how we\u2019re doing some of the horizontal pad drilling programs that we\u2019re putting in place we\u2019re seeing very-very good early results. But we need to see good returns on these things to make investments. And so I\u2019ll just say we do expect some recovery in prices as the year moves on but if we end up in a depressed environment we can make adjustment to that. Remember a lot of our volume in that area, we benefit from no royalty and that\u2019s a big competitive advantage, as you get down where others might be at the margin more than we are. We\u2019re in pretty good shape because we don\u2019t have royalty and we\u2019ve got a long-long queue available to us. Iain Reid : Okay, just one other thing, I heard what you said on Wheatstone in terms of schedule. I just wonder though where you are in terms of budget and CapEx. Is there any update you can give us on that relative to the original budget because we haven't had a project update for that one? John Watson : No, we\u2019re still operating under the current appropriation request that we approve which is the -- the Wheatstone project was a $29 billion U.S. project and we\u2019ve had some ups and downs frankly right now we\u2019re benefiting from currency movements if you -- the Australian dollar I think is around $0.78 so we\u2019re benefiting from that. We\u2019ve had some ups and downs there but -- and have used some of the contingency in the project but we\u2019re still operating within that same appropriation request. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question please. Doug Leggate : John, you've done a -- you've obviously got a tough job of trying to manage through the cycle and if you look at the near-term growth I think you've been pretty clear that that is pretty much prefunded with the commitments you've got going on. But once you get to 2017, once you've delivered your target, assuming an oil price range which is lower than we have had in the last five years, how do you think about the trade-off between continued growth versus other uses of cash like a return to buybacks? And what's on my mind is over the last 10 years before the growth phase, the share prices did just fine in a relatively flat production profile over that 10-year period? So that's my first question. I've got a related follow-up, please. John Watson : Well, I guess I\u2019d say volume has always been an outcome of our views about the quality of the investments that we available to us and that will continue to govern our decisions. If we wind up in a lower price environment in 2017 that we might have thought we would be in a year ago I think there will be contributing factors to that, one will be costs. And so, we don\u2019t make decisions to invest based on our volume target, we make decisions to invest based on our perception of the value that's available to us. There were confluents of events that resulted in several significant projects coming together at the same time. We had lease retention issues we had good gas contracts available to us for example on Wheatstone. We've had a moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico which is good things. And so -- and you had lease commitments and things of that sort, so you would not only choose to have all those projects be together, but we've felt individually they were good and we felt we had the capacity to handle them. And we're starting to see them deliver today and frankly if you look at our -- for all the talk about these projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone are 30 year to 40 year projects, and didn\u2019t come online yet. And when they come online and over the cycle, I'm very comfortable that the economics will be just fine and they'll be prolific contributors to the Company for years to come. And all these new projects also have follow-on opportunities to them, because we typically -- first phases of projects don\u2019t result in all the resource being developed and the incremental economics are better. Our priority around spend has been pretty clear. One, we're going to pay the dividend and we're going to increase it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. And we'll invest to do that. And we'll do that within the parameters of our balance sheet. We have viewed share repurchases at the Flywheel and the Flywheel is -- was available to us. We have cautiously spread out share repurchases over time, so we've tried not to just be in for a short period of time, we were in for a longer period of time. But obviously with the price environment we're seeing, we're discontinuing that program. But if we get to a circumstance where we're generating cash flow, we don\u2019t see the opportunities we get no reticence at all to repurchase shares if we think that's a better opportunity for us. Doug Leggate : My follow-up, and I will be quick I realize we are at the top of the hour, but it's kind of more of a macro question. It's going to be a tough one to answer. But when we think about Chevron's role as a global player, 1.9 million barrels a day of oil and the operated obviously is a lot bigger than that, do you think that Chevron has been representative of big oil and non-OPEC, meets a certain oil price environment to maintain flat production, what would that number be for Chevron? In other words to hold production flat close to the start-up of the major projects, can you hold flat at 50 or 60 or 70? What do you think that number is now? I will leave it there. John Watson : Well Doug you're right it is a tough question. If we're in a $50 world, there will not be -- just as I said at a macro level around the world I don\u2019t see many investments that are going to go with the fiscal terms we see in place today with the cost levels we see today. I see very few major oil projects going forward. There will be incremental investments on existing projects to mitigate the decline there will be some shale investments that maybe economic, but I don\u2019t know for example around the world of full cycle of economics deepwater projects that go at $50 at the current cost structure. I don\u2019t know of new oil sands volumes that can come on at $50 and there are oil fields in decline everywhere so I just don\u2019t see that. Now cost can adjust, fiscal terms can adjust and so it's hard to speak definitively for a very long period of time, but it is very clear that the incremental barrels are coming from more complex developments overtime. With all the enthusiasm around shale I think it's important to remember it's 4 million barrels a day out of a 92 million barrel base. And you're going to see the rate of growth in that volume was due to slow and you're going to see a reduction in that rate of growth in response to current prices. I think we're at the end of our time I thank you very much for the questions. That -- and in closing we\u2019d just say we appreciate everyone's participation. I especially want to thank the analysts on behalf of all participants. We look forward to seeing you at our March Security Analyst Meeting, so Jonathan thank you. Operator : Thank you. And thank you ladies gentlemen. This does conclude Chevron's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington, please go ahead. Pat Yarrington : Okay, thank you Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jeff Gustavson and Frank Mount who are currently transitioning the General Manager of Investor Relations role. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company's first quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.37 per diluted share. Excluding gains from asset sales, foreign exchange effects and other special items, earnings were $0.76 per diluted share or $1.4 billion. This is a better outcome than the decline in commodity prices would have implied. This is because operationally, it was a very solid quarter for both upstream and downstream. Production volumes were strong and downstream asset utilization and reliability were high, plus operating cost control was evident throughout the enterprise. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 10% and our debt ratio at quarter end was 18%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield about 3.8%. Turning to slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.3 billion for the first quarter. This reflected lower upstream results due to the sharp decline in commodity prices as well as negative working capital effects of approximately $2 billion. The majority of the working capital effects are temporary in nature and we expect these to reserve in future quarters. These impacts were only partially offset by strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals businesses. In the quarter, proceeds from asset sales totaled approximately $950 million, the majority of which related to the sale of our interest in multiple offshore and onshore leases in Nigeria. In February, the Company successfully executed a $6 billion bond offering. Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of approximately 11% from first quarter 2014 and over 20% lower than fourth quarter. At quarter-end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $13 billion and our net debt position was about $21 billion. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2015 earnings were approximately $1.9 billion lower than first quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $2.7 billion between quarters; significantly lower crude realizations were partially offset by positive foreign exchange effects, higher gains on asset sales and favorable tax items. Foreign exchange gains in the first quarter were substantial, $580 million in total. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Downstream results increased by over $700 million, primarily driven by stronger worldwide refining and marketing margins. Operationally, first quarter results were amongst the very best we've had in several years, a perfect combination of margin strength and improved refining reliability. The variance in the other segment was primarily associated with the absence of an impaired recognized in first quarter 2014 following sustation [ph] of certain mining operations, primarily offset by higher tax and other corporate charges. Turning to slide 6, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2015 with the fourth quarter of 2014. First quarter earnings were approximately $900 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion between quarters, reflecting lower realizations and assets on gains partially offset by lower impairments and operating costs. Downstream earnings were lower by $95 million, stronger U.S. margins and lower operating expenses across the global systems were more than offset by the absence of gains on asset sales recognized in the fourth quarter and an unfavorable swing and timing effects between quarters. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges. Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Jeff Gustavson : Thanks Pat. Turning to slide 7. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were about $900 million lower than fourth quarter's results. Sharply lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by $735 million, our crude and liquids realizations all dropped by approximately 35% between periods. Gains on asset sales were lower by $330 million. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain following the sale of our interests in certain LPG pipeline assets, which are associated with the upstream segment. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. Lower operating and exploration expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation charges, including impairments for several smaller assets. Turning to slide 8. International upstream earnings were about $200 million lower than last quarter's results. Significantly lower crude prices impacted earnings by $1.3 billion. Our average international crude realizations were down over 30% between quarters, consistent with the decline in Brent prices. Lower operating expenses across multiple countries increased earnings by $335 million. In March, the U.K. government implemented a change in the petroleum tax law retroactive to the beginning of the year, which resulted in a one-time deferred tax benefit of $350 million. The absence of impairments from the prior quarter increased earnings by $570 million, while lower gains on asset sales this quarter decreased earnings by $360 million. The other bar included multiple components. Two notable drivers for this positive variance were stronger liftings and foreign exchange effects. Slide 9 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014. Net production increased by almost 100,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price effects increased production by 55,000 barrels per day as lower crude prices increased cost recovery and other volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts. Major capital project ramp ups at Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh, increased production by 42,000 barrels per day. Plant turnaround activity was heavy in the fourth quarter, particularly at our SGI/SGP facilities in Kazakhstan as well as in Thailand and Australia. First quarter by contrast was much lighter in planned maintenance and this accounted for higher production of 36,000 barrels per day between periods. Growth from shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian contributed 10,000 barrels per day. External constrains, primarily lower gas demands in Southeast Asia as well as weather-related impacts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar reflects greater unplanned downtime in other non-related items. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2015 and the first quarter 2014. Net production increased by 93,000 barrels per day between periods. Price effects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 50% drop in crude prices between periods. Last year, Brent averaged $108 per barrel in the first quarter. This year Brent averaged $54 per barrel in the first quarter. Shale and tight production increased by 43,000 barrels per day due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian as well as in the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Major capital projects increased production by 35,000 barrels per day. Production ramp-ups in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh, Trinidad and Brazil were all positives. The shutdown of Angola LNG which occurred subsequent to last year's first quarter partially offset these increases. Asset sales resulted in loss production of 34,000 barrels per day, principally driven by divestments of our assets in Chad and in the Netherlands. The decrease of 22,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines, partially offset by lower turnaround activity and unplanned downtime. Our base business continues to perform well with the managed decline rate below our existing guidance. First quarter net production rate of 2.681 million barrels per day is a strong start to the year and is above the flat to 3% growth range we indicated in January as our production guidance. While this is above our guidance, it is important to remember that we have maintenance turnarounds and asset sales plans for later in the year. I would also like to comment on an issue we mentioned in our 10-K about our operations in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where we produced 76,000 barrels per day net in the first quarter. It now appears more likely that our future production levels in the Partitioned Zone could be negatively impacted due to our inability to secure work and equipment permits. The potential for a shutdown of production was not anticipated in our flat to 3% guidance range. We do not know for sure how production impact will occur and if does occur, we cannot estimate its duration. In any case, we estimate that the 2015 financial impact from a potential shutdown would be minimal. Turning to slide 11. US downstream results decreased $183 million between quarters. Importantly, the operational results noted in the green bars were over $500 million stronger between periods. Margins increased earnings by $435 million driven by unplanned industry downtime and tight product supply on the US West Coast. US Gulf Coast margins were also strong reflecting industry refinery maintenance patterns and strong seasonal demand. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million primarily associated with reduced turnaround in maintenance activities. Timing effects represented a $250 million decrease to earnings mainly due to the absence of positive year-end inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter and unfavorable mark-to-market swings between quarters on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of gains on asset transactions from the prior quarter decreased earnings by $460 million. Turning to slide 12. International downstream earnings improved by $88 million between quarters. Lower margins decreased earnings by $70 million. Marketing margins fell, largely the result of product pricing lag effects evident in both Asia and Australia. Reduced operating expenses increased earnings by $120 million. Timing effects represented a $215 million decrease to earnings. As in the US segment, this represented the absence of favorable year-end inventory effects booked in the fourth quarter and adverse swings between the quarters and mark-to-market valuations on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of one-time charge in fourth quarter related the economic buyout of a legacy pension liability increased earnings by $160 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. The largest single component was favorable foreign currency effects. With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Pat. Pat Yarrington : All right, thanks, Jeff. Turning now to slide 13. In response to the downturn, we are aggressively pursuing cost savings. Excluding fuel, operating cost in the first quarter are down 13% from the average 2014 quarter. To-date, we have completed more than 2,200 supplier engagements with 700 more in progress. We\u2019re working across all spend categories to negotiate supplier reductions and to rebid contracts when sufficient reductions have not been offered. The results have been encouraging with over $900 million of contract savings already negotiated. The pie chart shows upstream spend categories, [00:00:57] our supplier cost reduction effort and the $900 million quoted is enterprise-wide. This represents cash savings we expect to capture in 2015. We\u2019ll see it show up as the year unfolds in multiple ways; lower operating expenses, reduced capital outlays, and decreases in cost of goods sold. Spend categories closer to the Wellhead and activities with the shorter term contracts as well as shorter cycle times from order date to delivery date are seeing the sharpest declines. We\u2019re also seeing more immediate responsiveness from suppliers supporting our US operations. Looking externally for improvements is only part of addressing our cost structure. We\u2019re also reengineering our internal work processes, initiating organization reviews, rightsizing our work teams to better match spend and activity levels and all of this to align with current market conditions. Our objective is a simpler, more efficient, more productive and affordable organization that directly supports our business priorities. Finally, we are pursuing capital and operating efficiencies throughout the organization, getting more for each dollar of spend. In the upstream, we are applying our experience with running manufacturing type operations to our shale and tight developments in the US and elsewhere. This is driving significant efficiency improvements and lowering the costs of our horizontal well programs in both the Midland and Delaware basins. In the downstream, we are using tools like Lean Six Sigma to improve efficiency throughout our operations and one specific example, we\u2019ve shortened the downtime by 30% associated with terminal and tank inspection and maintenance activities, which should lead to sizeable cost savings over time. Turning to slide 14. You recall a key commitment from our March presentation related to covering our dividend in 2017 from free cash flow. We outlined how we intended to do that and I like to put a few of our accomplishments into that context. Cash flow growth is a near-term priority. While absolute prices in the first quarter were not favorable, our production was. Base business performance was strong and our base decline rate was less than 2%. We also continue to ramp up at Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico. The fifth well is now online and growth production is up to over 70,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent, exceeding initial expectations. We completed some critical milestones on the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia. At Gorgon, we started up the first gas turbine generator successfully, an important step in the overall plant commissioning process. At Wheatstone, we successfully installed the topside for the offshore platform -- production platform. We have posted new pictures today and a video of both projects will be posted early next week. I encourage you to look at these on our investor website at chevron.com. And finally, our downstream and chemicals business is performing very well. We do think spend is our second priority. I\u2019ve already talked through the cost structure savings we\u2019re pursuing. In addition to that, we\u2019re on a clear path to reduce capital spending over the next several years as our major capital projects come online and our spending flexibility increases. Budgeted capital spending is planned at $35 billion this year, a 13% reduction from 2014. Cash spending is down -- this quarter is down 11% from first quarter a year ago. By 2017, we expect to have over $8 billion in additional C&E flexibility compared to 2015. And finally, we\u2019re making excellent progress on our asset sales. We realized almost $6 billion in proceeds last year and will be adding nearly $4 billion to that in the first four months of this year with a recently completed lease sales in Nigeria and the divestiture of Caltex Australia. In 16 months, we\u2019ve achieved almost $10 billion in total sales proceeds versus a $15 billion 48-month target. We will continue to sell assets when we can generate good value. Moving to slide 15, I would like to close by reiterating the near-term value proposition that Chevron offers. We expect to deliver industry-leading volume growth between now and 2017. That growth is sourced from Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico and Mafumeira Sul and Angola LNG in Angola. In addition, we are poised for a significant growth in our shale and tight resources, particularly in the Permian in the US. On top of the pure volume growth, we also offer margin expansion. The cash margins associated with these projects, primarily in the orange portion of the shaded bar, are projected higher than our cash margins today and many significant leasehold. By 2017, we expect our cash margins on our overall portfolio to increase by approximately 35% from where they are today assuming $60 average Brent price this year and $70 average Brent price in 2017, which is consistent with current futures prices. We believe that our outsized volume growth combined with outsized margin should lead to outsized value growth for our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I appreciate you listening in this morning. We are now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we already have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary and we will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Ed Westlake : Good morning, Pat and congratulations Jeff on the move, and welcome to Frank. Just I guess the question around cash flow to start with. Thanks for shouting out the working capital, I think the market would have had kittens if it was a $2 billion CFO number. I mean obviously, if you have net income and DD&A, you get a high number, but I presume some of the deltas or things like dividends from associates being less than net income and the timing of tax payments, if there is any color on that? But my general question is, how does this cash flow stack up against your internal expectations for the quarter appreciate, obviously the oil price is very low. And has anything changed in terms of your cash flow projections going forward in what you see as a more normalized oil price? Pat Yarrington : Okay, yeah, thanks, Ed, appreciate the question and I appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in cash. You\u2019re right. So it was a low cash from operations quarter, but we did have $2 billion of adverse working capital effects, so if you added those back, we would be at about $4.3 billion. What I would say is, if you looked at our sensitivity on oil price relative to prior quarters and look at it this quarter, this very much is in-line and in fact, it\u2019s actually a little bit stronger than just a pure sensitivity would suggest. I\u2019ll just mention the number again for everybody, it\u2019s somewhere between $325 million and $350 million per dollar Brent change. So we\u2019ve had a significant drop in Brent prices, and therefore a significant drop in earnings as well as cash flow. You\u2019re absolutely right, Ed, that there were some decrements relative to normal quarters in terms of the amount of affiliate distributions that we received. This quarter was, I would say, pretty minimal in terms of that. We do expect that to turnaround in the subsequent three quarters, so that\u2019s just a timing issue. In terms of how this looks relative to our plan going forward, if you recall the numbers that we showed you in March, the slides that we showed you with financial projections, all assumed a $60 world for Brent, and I think we\u2019re exactly in that phase. And so I look at our profile this year in terms of how earnings have come in and cash have come in and assuming we end up at a $60 world for Brent, which looks very reasonable given where the futures markets are than I think we are exactly on plan and very consistent with the cash profile that we showed you back in March. And you\u2019ll recall, for everybody, that we did have a significant deficit anticipated in 2015 and then we showed you the pattern of how we would move out of that deficit out to 2017, getting full coverage of our dividend by 2017. I mentioned the asset sales that we have, the first quarter was nearly $1 billion and here in April already, we have the sale as well. So already through four months, we've got a significant contribution of about $4 billion. So asset sales are a key component there as well. Ed Westlake : Thank you. I think I asked three questions in one. So I will defer to the next in line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Pat, Jeff. Pat Yarrington : Good morning. Jeff Gustavson : Good morning. Neil Mehta : So Pat, I wanted you to talk through the dividend here and just how we're thinking about dividend growth, historically, you\u2019ve raised the dividend in the second quarter earlier this week. You kept it flat, so want to see if this represents the departure from the views on dividend growth or maybe just the change in the timing on when you evaluate it? Pat Yarrington : It's a good question, Neil and let me just start by saying that maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our number one priority. That has not changed. Our financial priorities have not changed, but what has changed is our immediate financial environment, the near-term environment has changed and so the board chose not to increase the dividend this quarter. It is similar to what we did back in 2008 and 2009, when prices last fell significantly. We are supporting a 3.8% yield, but clearly, we are not running very strongly on earnings or cash flow at the moment due to commodity prices. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the first quarter was not a very stable financial environment, it was very fluid in terms of both revenues and costs. And so I think our overall decision is going to be based on what we feel is affordable and supportable in perpetuity, because we don't want to get into a position where we are having to cut the dividend or trim the dividend in anyway. And therefore, the timing and the size of an increase will be a function of how cash and earnings and asset sales or major capital projects execution and frankly, future commodity prices, I mean that is a significant factor, how those all play out in the coming quarters. And really how we see commodity prices playing out over a longer sweep of time. All of those factors will influence that decision. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Pat. And then want to come back to your point on the neutral zone. And I think Jeff, you made the point that the financial impact would be limited or immaterial. The number you shadowed out there represents about 3% of your volumes, so curious as to why earnings impact could be immaterial, is that because the margins associated with those barrels could be lower and just a broader status update on the [indiscernible] field would be helpful as well. Pat Yarrington : Yes. So essentially you are right. The financial impact is minimal because of the relationship to margins essentially. And then on the steamflood status, it was our -- we did have steam breakthroughs, so we did have success in that pilot. It was our expectation, it is our expectation to go into feed later this year, perhaps around the third quarter, but obviously depending upon circumstances and how they unfold over the next few weeks and these discussions between Saudi and the Kuwaitis on the partition zone. It could be \u2013 there could be somewhat of an impact there. I will say that there are discussions that are ongoing underway because this is obviously a very serious circumstance and it's being taken seriously. So we put a lot of could and potential and words like that in our language, because we really don't know and the hope is that this can get solved, we are optimistic that this can get solved. Neil Mehta : Thank you, Pat. And Jeff, congratulations. Jeff Gustavson : Thank you, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : Hey. Good morning, Pat. Congrats, Jeff and Frank. First question is just on the OpEx. Thank you for the helpful color on that front. I guess what I'm wondering is as we think about how the first quarter progressed on a year-over-year or a quarter-over-quarter basis and what you called out relative to I believe it was John\u2019s commentary last quarter, I think the last cycle you talked about a $4 billion saved number, kind of where do you think you are in those structural sales opportunities and how we should sequentially be thinking about this as we look at 2Q and the second half? Pat Yarrington : Right. I think that our profile at least what we've seen so far in the first quarter with all of the concerted and systematic effort that we've got underway throughout the entire enterprise, I feel that we should have really good operating expense trends as we move through the remaining three quarters of the year. We are seeing cost reductions over a whole series of cost categories anywhere from 10% to 20% and some of that of course will end up in OpEx spend, some of that will end up in capital expenditures, lower capital outlays, but I would just say from the response on the part of suppliers, the intensity with which we are pursuing this, the fact that if we are not getting the cost reductions that we are anticipating from a given supplier that we are willing to move market share and have done so, all of that I think bodes very well for our bottom line and our cash spend really over the course of subsequent periods here. Phil Gresh : So just a clarification. If you were to maybe put it in terms of innings like what you actually realized in the first quarter because I think the OpEx is down $600 million year-over-year, so I am just trying make that for with $4 billion number and think about how far along you are versus are you actually in the early stages? Pat Yarrington : I think we're in the very early stages in terms of what has been recognized in the first quarter results. So I think there is a lot of potential still to come. Jeff Gustavson : This is Jeff. Just to be clear, the $4 billion was a 2009 number. What we saw back in 2009, nothing that we put out here recently. Phil Gresh : Understood. Just on -- my second question is on CPChem. I think there has been some discussion out there about the potential to maybe officially leverage that balance sheet. So maybe you could just talk about your thoughts on that and whether there's any potential of that in 2015? Pat Yarrington : Okay, sure. In the past, CPChem has held debt. And then they've gone through a period here where they were generating tremendous amounts of cash and dividending that to their parents. Now they are in a position where they have investment opportunities through that US Gulf Coast cracker project and so it would not be unreasonable to think that they would go into the debt market in order to fund some of their investment opportunities. Phil Gresh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Hey, good morning, everybody. Pat Yarrington : Good morning. Evan Calio : Yeah, thanks for the comment on the dividend and maybe I will kind of try further there. I know in 2009 you raised the dividend in July of your typical kind of April-May period for the raise after a moderate commodity recovery. I know there are many factors and the board ultimately sets the dividend. What's the key metric that\u2019s your focus when you are looking at that decision and does it differ today at all because you are in a kind of bigger project ramp-up period? Thanks. Pat Yarrington : So I really think it's important to take a long-term view on the dividend and the outlook on cash and earnings over a longer sweep of time. So I think that is really morphed. Fundamentally the issue then will we happen to sit on our capital program at this particular point time. And I think it is fair to say that with what's happened in oil markets in the last six to nine months, there is a complete reshaping of what's going on, a rebalancing of what's going on. And I think it's reasonable to think that taking sometime to understand where things shake out for the long-term is a very important and prudent step. I don't want to get ahead of what the board's views on this might be, so I can't really comment any further. The dividend is very important to us. We want remain competitive on it. We pay attention to our yield, we pay attention to our payouts on earnings and our payouts on cash flows. We want to be competitive on this, we want to continue to grow it. So all I can say is, it\u2019s got high priority and this is something that gets looked at every single quarter and profiles on out in terms of earnings and cash flows gets looked at every quarter by the board. Evan Calio : Great. That's fair. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the \u2013 particularly, congratulations on the Caltex sale. On the downstream, can you give us any idea of how you expect that asset sale, those assets sales have affected your returns in the downstream portfolio. So as we roll forward with international, I know it was in non-consolidated, but how they compare relative to the rest of your portfolio and how that portfolio may look absent Caltex? Thank you. Pat Yarrington : Yeah, so, I think you -- we should commented as it had a positive contribution, obviously, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be noticeable in any meaningful way. Its absence will not be noticeable in any meaningful way. Evan Calio : Okay, yes, fair enough, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please? Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning everybody, and Jeff, thank you for everything, it\u2019s been a pleasure. Jeff Gustavson : Thanks. Paul Sankey : Can I just ask about the Neutral Zone again, how much did you see in for volumes in your targets for this year and for the 2017 3.1? Pat Yarrington : So, this year would have been in the neighborhood of what we produced in the first quarter here, which was around 76,000 barrels a day. We would have been anticipating a decline between 2015 and 2017 to something a little around 60, maybe 62,000 barrels a day in 2017. Paul Sankey : Good. And so, Pat, you\u2019re saying that basically that margins are so low there that regardless of losing whatever it is, 70 -- 60 -- 70,000 barrels a day, the financial impact will literally be minimal? Pat Yarrington : Yes. Paul Sankey : Well, okay. That was the -- that was the volume question. Is there anything to add on the California downstream market and I\u2019ll leave with that? Thanks a lot. Pat Yarrington : So, I think in California, we had the fortunate position of having high reliability at a time when the overall industry market was very tight and it was tight for a couple of operational reasons related to other industry -- other industry players. As those get resolved and I think one has been resolved and one is going to take a little bit longer to resolve, but as those get resolved and I think you would anticipate that the margins would move towards a more normal -- a more normal level. Of course, second quarter is typically a reasonable margin period because of gasoline demand pickup. So, there is seasonality factors there, but in general, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the West Coast margin was impacted significantly here in the first quarter because of these industry factors and Chevron ran well, operated well and was able to take advantage of that. Paul Sankey : Pat, it\u2019s totally obscure, but I was wondering was that part -- was California part of the working -- why was the working capital movements so enormous in the quarter I guess is what I should have asked. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : It\u2019s a good question. It was really a function. When you look at our working capital elements here, the biggest drivers really just related to a disproportionate movement in the way our accounts payable and our accounts receivables moved over the quarter\u2019s period of time. Normally, when you are in a more stable price environment, then you expect whatever happens and your receivables and payables to offset. That did that happen in this particular period. And so, we had a net cash consumption of size related to accounts payable, receivables net and this is where I said and I feel very comfortable saying that we expect this to unwind as the quarters progress. Paul Sankey : I guess what I\u2019m driving at is, the history of that typically is the California operations have a lot of long distance crude, is that what we\u2019re talking about here or is there dollar effect or something? Pat Yarrington : No, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re -- it\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about and in the past, when we talked about, we\u2019ve had working capital effects related to the California. In many of those circumstances in the past that has been related to the operations, the specific operations or lack of operations at Richmond. That is not the scenario that we\u2019re talking about this year. Paul Sankey : But I\u2019m still not to why it\u2019s so big, I mean, you say it\u2019s payables, receivables type move, but I just wonder, is it the dollar or is it, what is it? Pat Yarrington : I mean, it\u2019s just the rate of activity change between what\u2019s happened on your revenue side and what\u2019s happened on your cost side. Paul Sankey : Okay, I will leave at that. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please? Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. First, Jeff just want to say thank you for all the help over the last couple of years and best of luck with your new assignment and Frank, welcome aboard to the IR lane. Pat, on the first quarter, the cost saving realization in the P&L, I think you mention talking about $600 million. How much of [indiscernible] in many of the area that you operate as much weaker than the US dollar, so as a result, in US dollar term, the cost is down? Pat Yarrington : So, your question is about foreign exchange, the 600 -- roughly $580 million. Paul Cheng : No, I am not talking about the $580 million, which is related to currency translation. I am talking about the actual operating cost, because let\u2019s say, you pay your employee in UK with the pound and then get translated into your US dollar, even if the cost base will remain the same in local currency in US dollar is much lower, so that\u2019s the amount that I am just curious, how -- of the 600, how much is related to that? Pat Yarrington : So the \u2013 it\u2019s really \u2013 they\u2019re not related. I mean, our operating expense, the influence of foreign exchange on our operating expense is really pretty minimal through the quarter. It\u2019s more significant in terms of capital spending, but on an operating expense base it has not \u2013 it is not a significant component that has led to the decline in operating expense between periods. Paul Cheng : Interesting. So given that in many of your major operating area, the dollar have strengthened against their local currency, but is not much of an impact in USA? Pat Yarrington : That\u2019s correct. Paul Cheng : I see. Okay. All right, that\u2019s fine. A final one that\u2019s real quick, over-lifting and under-lifting in the quarter? Pat Yarrington : Yeah, we\u2019re about 1.7% under-lifted for the quarter. Paul Cheng : And Pat, at the end of the quarter, do you still under-lift or do you upper-lift or over-lift? Pat Yarrington : I don\u2019t know, Frank. I just know for the quarter, it was 1.7% and I don\u2019t know \u2013 Frank Mount : No, at the end of the quarter, Paul, it was \u2013 we were 1.7% under-lifted, that\u2019s at the end of the quarter. Pat Yarrington : At the end of the quarter, okay. Paul Cheng : And how about for the quarter your sales? Pat Yarrington : Within the quarter? Paul Cheng : Yes, means that the quarter sales comparing to the quarter production, are we over-lift or under-lift? Frank Mount : I\u2019ll have to follow-up with you that. Paul, I don\u2019t have that number with me, but the 1.7% is the number that you should focus on. Paul Cheng : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning everyone. And Jeff, let me also say thanks to all your help. Welcome Frank. I got to say, I am optimistic on a better Q position with Frank. I want to see how it goes. On asset sales, you are two-thirds of the way through the $15 billion number. One can, you help thinking with maybe some upside yet again to that target. Could you frame for us how you\u2019re thinking about that. And if could [indiscernible] this year. One of your competitors in your backyard in California seems pretty keen on asset sales, I am just curious on the other side of the ledger, if you have taken a hard look at bolt-ons to your existing California position? And then I do have a related follow-up. Pat Yarrington : Yeah, so we did just increase the target back in March moving to the $15 billion over the four years. We are only six weeks later than that approximately now. And even though the CAL sale is a significant transaction and we\u2019re happy to have it behind us, I am not in a position to change the overall target. I feel very comfortable about our ability to conclude the $15 billion over the next year and a half or so that are remaining, actually it\u2019s more than that, more than two and a half years, two and a half years that are remaining. So I don\u2019t want to up that target, but I feel comfortable about our ability to hit that target in the timeframe that we have set. CAL will be booked in the second quarter, it was not a first quarter item. And then in terms of any sort of bolt-on activity, obviously we look at circumstances of assets and opportunities around the globe. We evaluate that all the time. I am not going to speak specifically about anything that\u2019s under consideration or not under consideration. It has a pretty high hurdle is all I would say in order to move into our portfolio at this time. Any sort of additional portfolio move like that would have a pretty high hurdle because it would need to compete post acquisition for capital against the assets that we already have in queue. Doug Leggate : I appreciate. And my follow-up is, I am afraid I am going to label the working capital issue, just to leave that more, if I may. My sense is at least when you have such a massive move than the oil price at least, a slow down on activity levels, the payables that you would have as a source of working capital, as you pay those, in other words, as cash goes out the door, the subsequent payables that would replace those would be substantially lower assuming your activity level was reduced. So, what I'm trying to understand is, where is your confidence or can you help us walk through why that after a such move in the oil price that working capital position would reverse out if your activity level is moved to a lower level, just your view on that. [ph] Pat Yarrington : Well, I think it's really the combination, I mean; I look at these on a net basis, right. I look at the movement in your receivables and the movement in your payables and as I say, as you get into a stable environment, any sort of price impact that you get, typically moves through both of those in a relatively synonymous way or a synchronized way. And so, when you\u2019re in a discontinuous situation like you had in the first quarter, I think, when you get into a stable environment, if prices have come down, and cost structure has come down, then you get into a matching there, and so I think that is what I'm really trying to imply is that, as you move into that matching phase, that's where you will get the reversal and you'll return to a more normal relationship between receivables and payables. Doug Leggate : Is that through the course of the year, Pat, or you would expect a more quicker resolution for that or is it going to kind of ramp higher or going to be balanced over time? Pat Yarrington : Accounts payable receivables, I would expect to begin reversing relatively quickly here. I think it's a trend, a change in the pattern that you will see in the second quarter. Doug Leggate : Great, I will leave at that. Thanks very much indeed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil, your question please. Blake Fernandez : Folks, good morning and I would also offer congratulations to both Jeff and Frank. I had two questions, one, could you give an update on the recently formed JV you did in the Gulf of Mexico with Keathley Canyon, any status update or game plan as you kind of take over operatorship there? Pat Yarrington : Well, I think you know, I think I'd like to leave a lot of that for our second quarter here, because our plans are to have Jeff -- Jay Johnson on the line with us in second quarter, and I think we'll let the opportunities go there. But we're pleased with the joint development opportunity that we've got here, this really builds on our Anchor discovery and our Guadalupe discovery and it combines the Tiber and Gila discoveries where BP had success there and so we feel like it's a very good development opportunity potentially for hubs where you can get scale assets, economic assets and going forward, we have a lot of continuing appraisal work to do though. So I don't really want to say much more than that. Blake Fernandez : Fair enough, we can follow-up next quarter with Jay. The second question Pat is really kind of on the U.S. in particular, where we saw negative earnings, I guess, I viewed the Gulf and Permian as key growth areas where we would expect fairly high margins, I realized there were some impairments kind of one-off in the quarter, but you highlight DD&A being elevated, is it fair to believe that DD&A kind of remains at an elevated level until we book additional reserves over time? And if I could may be just sneak in a -- finally a follow-up on the Partitioned Zone. You mentioned the financial impact being minimal, I presume that applies to both earnings and cash flow, but if you could please just confirm that, I would appreciate it. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : Yeah, so just sticking with the upstream loss position, I think we have to look at what the driver was here for the loss position, obviously very poor realizations, only $43 a barrel and liquids realizations, gas overall was $2 in the quarter roughly. So, the significant decline in revenues. I talked about what's happening on our cost structure side of things but we're going to see the cost structure come down with lag effects, you're not going to see that in a first quarter period of time, so the cost structure is continuing to evolve and so first quarter again was not a particularly pretty picture from a margin standpoint. On depreciation, you're right, we are seeing elevated depreciation and you would expect that depreciation to remain elevated and particularly for some of our deepwater assets until we have time to do, we get response time and we can see what the full recoverable, we can document kind of the full recoverable opportunity of that development play is. And back on PZ, it is the same earnings and cash. Blake Fernandez : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question please. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much, hi everyone. Just wanted to come to the milestones that you've achieved in Australia over the course of the quarter. The first question related to the first gas into turbine at Gorgon, that's obviously a huge milestone, is that being accomplished with gas from your hydrogen [ph] offshore or you\u2019re getting that from third-party sources and if it's not hydrogen, you still expect first gas somewhere around mid-year? Pat Yarrington : It's coming from domestic gas sources and yes, our expectation really is to have, we are on schedule for our Gorgon startup in the third quarter of this year and first gas, before the end of the year. Jason Gammel : And do you mean, first commercial cargoes, is that \u2013 Pat Yarrington : First commercial cargoes, sorry. Jason Gammel : Okay, great. Pat Yarrington : First LNG before the end of the year. Jason Gammel : Got it. And then obviously another major milestone you achieved at Wheatstone with the top side placement, but I guess from a schedule standpoint, I would expect that the onshore has got the most potential for slippage, just from a risk standpoint, can you talk about where you are at relative to schedule in terms of the onshore at Wheatstone? Pat Yarrington : Yes. So we are on schedule for Wheatstone. Obviously, the installation of the top sides on the steel gravity structure was a major milestone. But we've got seven of 24 process modules, major process modules that have been delivered on site. The trunk line is installed and hydro tested. The dredging is complete, the piling activities are completed, the roofs are on both of the LNG tanks, so we continue to make good progress both onshore and offshore and I do encourage you to take a look at the pictures that are on the website, because you'll be able to see the progress there. Jason Gammel : Okay. Very good. Thanks, folks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. As you are getting into 2015, presumably there was a lift of FIDs the company had on deck, are there any of those other than perhaps Kitimat that have been pushed out or suspended since January 1? Pat Yarrington : So, I would say the most significant, in fact the only really significant FID that\u2019s on plan for this year relates to TCO and the future growth project and we continue to work that through to FID obviously, it's an opportunity for us to take advantage of a lower cost structure, so we continue to do more detailed engineering and work through the cost estimates of this, continue to work with our partners and the government on this, so our expectation is fourth-quarter FID on that one. Pavel Molchanov : Okay, understood. Pat Yarrington : And in terms of the other FID projects, I mean part of the reduction that we took in our capital spending from 2014 to 2015 really did relate to the pacing of other major capital projects. Kitimat is a primary one there. We've moved that, I guess, I would say the spending on that out considerably. We are really only limiting ourselves here to appraisal work and continuing to look at the design and the cost structure of that. Indonesia deepwater development would have been another one. That has moved out. So there several other FIDs or pre-FID projects that we have pushed to see any monies into future years. Pavel Molchanov : And if I can ask a follow-up about the downstream segment, you've been pretty vocal in the past about the frustrations with California policy on carbon emissions in particular, given the decision last week to extend those rules out to 2030, does that change your view about perhaps retaining any of the California refining assets? Pat Yarrington : Well, I would just say that we are in a very advantaged California position. We've got two very strong world-class -- very competitive assets at Richmond and El Segundo. We've got a very good market position, very good brand strength. So, it\u2019s a quality asset that we have here and our expectation is that we will be able, over time, to work with whatever the regulatory framework is. At the same time, we do still think it's important to alert customers and alert government officials as to what the cost of compliance is for some of these programs. The AB32, the cap and trade portion, fuels under the cap came in to effect in January of this year and there are costs, new costs associated with being a refiner in the state as a result of that. Now, it does get passed on to consumers and so as that continues to move forward, then of course that cost increase could be something that consumers and regulators will be increasingly aware of. Pavel Molchanov : Okay, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody and let me be one of the last to wish you good luck, Jeff, in the next assignment and welcome Frank. If I could just go maybe with a couple of specific ones, Angola LNG I think at the Analyst Day you updated, you expected it to come on stream during the fourth quarter of this year back on stream. Any update on progress there that was maybe a little bit earlier than some of our expectations and maybe what all did you end up having to do to the project to get it ready for this year? Pat Yarrington : Okay. So work is still underway, significantly underway and the overall plan is to still have Angola LNG restart with LNG to the tank in the fourth quarter of this year, probably late in the fourth quarter of this year and then begin to ramp-up to about 75% of capacity by the first quarter of 2015. As is common, the plant will run for a period of time and then ALNG will make a decision as to whether or not they need to take the plant down to perform any sort of shut down, drain removal, that kind of cleanup activity. And they all decide at that point in time whether or not they want to do that early in the first part of 2016. In any case, we would expect ALNG to reach maximum capacity in the second quarter of 2016 if they decide to do those drain removals. Ryan Todd : Great. And I appreciate that. And then maybe just one general one, wondered if you can give couple of comments in your release, but I would appreciate any clarity as we've got varying views from different companies over in recent times. Any view on general product demand globally, both in the US and globally what you are seeing across your system? Any demand sort of weak or strong in different parts of the system as well? Pat Yarrington : I would say that going forward here and I'm thinking really globally here that product demand -- there are some leading indicators that would suggest the product demand as strengthening, I guess I would say modestly. And overall, probably have an overall demand profile for 2015 that would be somewhat stronger than 2014 from an oil consumption standpoint. Ryan Todd : And in the US, I think in your release it said that the product sales were, I can\u2019t remember, they were flat year-on-year versus 1Q14. Is that US gasoline, is that kind of same-store sales across your system or what number is that? Pat Yarrington : I'm not sure, which number are you talking, are you looking in the release itself? Ryan Todd : Yeah. I think it said branded gasoline sales were essentially flat with 2014, is that \u2013 so I am guessing that's kind of the same-store sales? Pat Yarrington : Well, it really is networks, it's our total network sales. Total network sales. It's really just a function of our branded distributions, right. I mean, our network hasn't changed significantly between periods of time. Ryan Todd : That's helpful. Alright. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : Yeah, good morning. Pat Yarrington : Good morning. Roger Read : I guess I would like to follow-up, it hasn't gotten much here this time around. Permian, kind of give us an update maybe what you are doing there, maybe your progression on rig count and then also how the cost deflation is flowing through there? Pat Yarrington : Okay. So our current outlook really for the Permian is to have about 21 rigs running. Currently in the March meeting we said it was something closer to 25. We expect to have about 325 gross wells this year. And that's down a little bit from what we said just a few week ago. Some of the reduction in the wells is due to a shift to horizontal drilling programs versus vertical drilling programs. And some of it also relates to joint venture arrangements what our joint development partner has reduced their activity levels compared to plans. We are transitioning more and more to horizontal work as opposed to vertical work. Horizontal wells obviously work better in this kind of a price environment. And I would just say that we are seeing very good well by well improvement in costs in each of these wells going forward. I think the cost reduction efforts are finding their way through to our overall drilling and completions cost, and we will be happy to give you a larger update, more in-depth update on our second quarter call. Roger Read : Okay. And then the other question I had is we could get back to \u2013 it was chart 14, you talked about flexibility in your spending going forward. I didn\u2019t catch the number, but I was just wondering if we should think about that as kind of \u2013 one, give us the number. Number two, can we think about that as ratable as we work through or is it very much going to be chunky as, for example, Gorgon gets going at the end of this year and obviously the CapEx drops off. And then how that may change the way the future FID process will work its way through as well? Pat Yarrington : Right. So the number that we provided between 2015 and 2017 is $8 billion cumulatively. And I think it\u2019s reasonable for you to think about that as reasonably ratable. I mean, it does really depend and it is forced heavily by the Gorgon and Wheatstone spend follow-up. But I think for purposes of what you\u2019re most likely doing I think thinking about it as being reasonably ratable make sense. Roger Read : Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks, and Jeff and Frank, good luck in new ventures. And Frank, I guess we will be talking together quite a lot more. Jeff Gustavson : Thank you. Frank Mount : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. Brad Heffern : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how cost savings that you\u2019ve realized today have aligned with what was contemplated by your original CapEx budget, if you are seeking cost deflation happen more quickly than you would have expected. I'm just looking at the international CapEx number for the first quarter, hence down $2 billion, is that good cost savings or is that just normal inter-quarter [ph] volatility? Pat Yarrington : All right. So I would say in general, the cost savings that we are seeing and that we anticipate seeing would probably be somewhat stronger than what we had baked into our $35 billion budget. And that's really just a function of when we were doing the budget and what we were anticipating versus what we are -- we believe being able to secure going forward. I don't think you will have seen much of that in the quarter-to-quarter comparisons as of yet, so what you're seeing quarter-to-quarter comparisons really has more to do with the pattern of actual spending from fourth to first. Brad Heffern : Okay, understood. And just thinking about that, if you prorate the first quarter for the full year, you are already below the $35 billion number. How should we think about the CapEx trajectory throughout 2015? Pat Yarrington : Yeah, I think you should think about it as being relatively evenly paced. The $35 billion target is what we expect to hit at the end of the year. Brad Heffern : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President-Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $571 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments of $1.96 billion and other charges of approximately $670 million relating to project suspensions and adverse tax effects, all of which were non-cash charges stemming from a downward revision in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. Excluding these special items, as well as asset-sale gains and foreign-exchange effects, earnings were $1.8 billion, or $0.97 per diluted share, approximately $400 million higher than first quarter on that same basis. A detailed reconciliation of the special items is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations was $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4.9 billion from the prior quarter. Our debt ratio at quarter end was 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of August 19. We're currently yielding 4.6%. Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $7.2 billion during the second quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than in the first quarter, the result of higher crude prices. We also benefited from strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals business. Temporary working capital effects reduced year-to-date cash flow by approximately $2 billion. We expect this impact to reverse in future quarters. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled approximately $3.9 billion, the vast majority of which related to our sale in the interest in Caltex, Australia. We are well ahead of pace on our four-year asset divestment program. In the past 18 months, we have recognized asset sale proceeds of nearly $11 billion, compared to our stated $15 billion goal over the 2014 to 2017 time period. Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 million for the quarter, essentially flat with the first quarter. Year-to-date cash capital expenditures were $15.2 billion, down $2.2 billion or 13% compared with the same period in 2014. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $12.2 billion and our net debt position was $19.4 billion. Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2015 earnings were $5.1 billion lower than second quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased to $7.5 billion between quarters. The impairments and other charges I noted previously accounted for $2.6 billion of this decline. Significantly lower crude realizations and the absence of second quarter 2014 asset sale gains make up the remaining variance between periods. Downstream results increased by $2.2 billion, primarily driven by higher worldwide margins and gains from asset sales, principally the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia. Operationally, the second quarter continued a positive quarterly pattern of high reliability, strong margins and good cost management. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items. Turning now to slide six, I'll compare results for the second quarter 2015 with the first quarter of 2015. Second quarter earnings were $2 billion lower than first quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the charges I previously discussed. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of first quarter asset sale gains and the positive UK tax adjustment were also large variances between periods. Downstream earnings increased $1.5 billion as gains on asset sales were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange swing between the quarters. Operationally, the quarters were fairly comparable. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items, partially offset by higher corporate charges, including severance accruals. Frank will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Frank Mount : Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $578 million lower than the first quarter's results. Asset impairments and project suspensions across multiple assets, primarily as Pat indicated, from a reduced price outlook, decreased earnings by $630 million. Higher realizations, consistent with an increase in domestic crude prices, increased earnings by $190 million. Exploration expenses, mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $70 million. The other bar reflects higher production, which was more than offset by higher DD&A rates. Turning to slide eight, international upstream earnings were $3.2 billion lower than last quarter's results. Asset impairments, primarily at Papa Terra in Brazil, project suspensions and adverse tax effects from price changes previously discussed reduced earnings by about $1.9 billion. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings between periods by approximately $670 million. The absence of last quarter's gains on asset sales and the deferred tax benefit from the UK tax change decreased earnings by $660 million. Increased exploration expenses resulted in lower earnings of $170 million. Higher realizations increased earnings by $395 million, consistent with the increase in Brent prices between the quarters. The other bar primarily consists of an unfavorable ruling on a decade-old tax issue and severance accruals booked in the second quarter. Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 85,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 22,000 barrels per day. Growth from our shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian, contributed 11,000 barrels per day. As we foreshadowed in our first quarter earnings call, production in the Partitioned Zone was shut down at the end of May based on the inability to secure work and equipment permits. The shutdown decreased production in the second quarter by 38,000 barrels per day. We're still not producing in the Partitioned Zone, and we have no updated guidance as to when production is likely to restart. Planned and unplanned downtime reduced production by 34,000 barrels per day between periods, primarily in Canada and in Australia. Price and cost recovery effects decreased production by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters as high crude prices and reduced spending decreased volumes associated with production share and variable royalty contracts. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and weather-related production limitations at Tengiz. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 51,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to production ramp-ups, primarily in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh. Shale and tight production increased by 46,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, the Marcellus and the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. Price and cost recovery effects increased production by 61,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 45% drop in crude prices between periods. The shutting of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by 45,000 barrels per day. Asset sales resulted in lost production of 33,000 barrels per day, principally driven by the divestment of our assets in Chad and the Netherlands. The decrease of 49,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and the impact of higher external constraints, partially offset by a favorable variance from less planned turnaround activity. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate within our existing guidance range. Year-to-date net oil equivalent production was 2.638 million barrels per day and within our 0% to 3% guidance for 2015 growth. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, the third quarter is expected to be a comparatively heavy turnaround period, and we believe the full year production guidance remains appropriate. Turning to slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $25 million between quarters. Tight product supply, primarily on the West Coast, boosted refining and marketing margins and increased earnings by $165 million between quarters. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $185 million, reflecting planned maintenance and turnaround activities at the El Segundo Refinery and commitments related to the Richmond Refinery modernization project. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects stronger results in our chemicals business. Turning to slide 12, international downstream earnings improved by $1.5 billion between quarters. Gains on asset sales, primarily related to the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia, increased earnings by $1.7 billion. Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $120 million between quarters as product price increases, including the negative price lag effects on naphtha and jet fuel failed to keep pace with rising crude costs. An unfavorable swing in the foreign currency effects lowered earnings by approximately $155 million. The variance in the other bar reflects multiple unrelated items. Jay will now provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay? James William Johnson : Thanks, Frank. Turning to slide 13, I'm going to discuss our Upstream business, where we continue to make good progress in delivering the projects that are driving our growth in volume, in value and in cash. Gorgon is a critical part of that growth, and we continue to work towards the first LNG cargo. As you can see from the photo, plant construction has advanced. We're nearing mechanical completion of the first train with over 60% of critical subsystems handed over to commissioning. We've posted new pictures today and I encourage you to look at them on our investor website and chevron.com. Turning to slide 14, the upstream work scope for initial production from the Jansz field is largely complete with the control systems now active. We've established communications from the central control room on Barrow Island to the subsea wells, which enables us to conduct commissioning activity on the upstream and pipeline systems. Final testing is underway for the subsea infrastructure and controls. At the plant, all LNG and condensate tanks required for first LNG are ready and commissioning of completed process systems is underway. Currently the critical path is through the refrigerant compressors and the hydrate prevention system for the subsea wells. We expect to perform the first commissioning run of the compressors and testing of the hydrate prevention system in late September. Once we're satisfied with the operation of these systems we'll be ready to introduce gas from the Jansz wells into the upstream pipeline and begin the startup of Train 1, which we currently expect late this year. The schedule is dependent on managing commissioning and startup risks, including equipment malfunctions, possible labor and weather disruptions, as well as other unforeseen issues. Our focus is on a safe and incident-free startup that leads to reliable long-term operations. We're working to achieve the first LNG cargo by year-end. However, given these risks, it's likely to occur in early 2016. Now let's talk about Wheatstone, moving to slide 15. Wheatstone is now over 65% complete. On the upstream side of the project, we successfully completed the float-over and installation of the offshore platform in April. Hook up and commissioning is on plan with all subsea structures now installed. The flow line installation is underway and the development drilling program ongoing. All nine wells were previously drilled to the top of the reservoir and we're now drilling the reservoir sections of each well and running the completions. At the plant site, 11 of 24 major process modules for Train 1 have been delivered. All refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have been installed and the domestic gas pipeline has been completed. The focus of activity at the plant has shifted from civil works to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation systems. The work on site is going very well. Our biggest challenge has been the delays in module delivery from a fabrication yard, which is putting pressure on the schedule. To address the delays, we've expanded to an additional yard and provided increased oversight in the yards. We've seen positive results from these actions and are not anticipating any further delays in the module delivery schedule. Additionally, we've increased bed capacity at the plant site and are updating our work plans to mitigate the impact to schedule. Our objective remains first LNG by year-end 2016, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress over the next 18 months. Turning to slide 16. Performance at the Jack/St. Malo lower tertiary development continues to exceed our plan. The sixth well was brought online ahead of schedule and total production has ramped up to around 80,000 barrels per day. The development drilling program continues and we're seeing some get improvements in cycle time, costs, and stimulation effectiveness with the most recent completion 20% better on cost and schedule than previous wells. Work to install the Big Foot Tension Leg Platform was suspended in early June when nine of the 16 tendons lost buoyancy. There were no environmental impacts or injuries, and we are investigating the root cause of the incident. We have secured the site, including successful recovery of the seven remaining tendons. The tension leg platform was undamaged and is being moved to a safe harbor location. Site surveys and equipment inspections are in progress to determine whether the installed piles and recovered tendons can be reused and what equipment will require replacement in order to complete the project. At this point, we are not expecting any Big Foot production in 2016 or 2017, which is a reduction from our original plan of 10,000 net barrels per day in 2016 and 22,000 net barrels per day in 2017. As we complete the investigation and update our plan, we will advise you accordingly. Appraisal drilling is ongoing at the Anchor discovery and in the Northwest Keathley Canyon area, now named Tigris. Tigris has the potential to offer a multi-field, hub development of the Guadalupe, Gila and Tiber discoveries with the potential addition of the Gibson exploration prospect, which we plan to drill around the end of this year. Appraisal drilling is underway at Guadalupe and recent results from deepening the Gila discovery well are encouraging with further appraisal planned. We continue to progress our opportunity cue in the deepwater and in the second quarter made another lower tertiary discovery at the Sicily prospect in Keathley Canyon Block 814. We're encouraged by the results of the discovery well and follow-up appraisal work is planned. Turning to slide 17. As we communicated in March, our Permian position is strong. We have a large, high-quality acreage position with advantage royalty, which we are cost-effectively developing. We remain on track to drill 325 wells this year and have expanded to multiple factory mode, horizontal well development programs across the Midland and Delaware basins. We remain committed to our pace development approach, but the short cycle nature of these investments allows us to adjust this pace relatively quickly. In the current market, we've been active in negotiating cost reductions with our suppliers, achieving rate reductions of 20% to 50% across our major drilling and completion spend categories. At the same time, we continue to improve our drilling and completion efficiency. Since last year, we achieved roughly a 15% increase in drilling footage and a 20% increase in frac stages per day. The initial production rates for these wells are also very encouraging with our Bradford Ranch laterals averaging 1,100 barrels a day and comprising around 90% liquids. In addition, current estimated well recoveries have increased by 30%. So in summary, cost reductions, improved efficiency, and increased recoveries have improved our development cost per barrel by around 35% relative to 2014 and make more than 3,000 well prospects economic at $50 per barrel WTI. Let's move to slide 18. The major capital projects driving our growth are nearing completion, and are underpinned by our strong base business. The volumes associated with this growth are accretive to our cash margins and will contribute to long-term cash flow. We've reduced our current year capital spending by $5 billion relative to 2014. In the current environment, we are planning to reduce our 2016 and 2017 capital programs and our flexibility in capital spending significantly increases as our projects already in execution are completed. We are pacing projects not yet in execution to ensure we capture the cost advantages presented by the current environment and are prioritizing them to manage our capital program. We continue to drive cost reduction and efficiency to strengthen our cash flow by systematically reviewing our organizational structures and activity levels in our business units and by working with our suppliers. Pat will now conclude by sharing the enterprise impacts of these efforts. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Turning to slide 19, I'd like to now provide an update on the self-help efforts that we have underway to lower our costs and improve our efficiency. To-date, we've identified more than $3 billion of spend reductions with about half coming through organizational reviews and half working through the supply chain. On the organizational side, efficiency reviews have recently concluded that covered our corporate gas and midstream and service company group. Similar reviews are occurring on a rolling basis within our upstream business units. Work activities in these identified groups have been prioritized, streamlined, and right-sized to the current environment. Savings totaled approximately $1.4 billion on a full run rate basis and represent both dollar and workforce reductions off the relevant base of about 20%. These benefits to our cost structure should become increasingly evident as we move through the next several quarters. In future periods, we expect to see additional savings identified as our remaining upstream units complete their reviews. We're also aggressively pursuing savings through the supply chain, particularly in the U.S., where our supplier responsiveness has been high. We have negotiated an excess of $1 billion in immediate savings, achieving product category reductions of typically 15% to 30%. We are also changing the way we work through greater standardization, project re-scoping, refinement of fit-for-purpose designs, and timing optimizations. In combination, we estimate negotiated savings and work changes will lower our future supply chain spend $1.6 billion. These savings will appear in multiple ways as we move through 2015 into 2016. Impacts will come in the form of lower operating expenses, lower capital and lower cost of goods sold. And we're not done. We expect more supply chain savings to be identified in future months, particularly as activity continues to flow and as additional spare capacity emerges. We are being aggressive in pursuing these self-help measures in response to a very challenging industry environment. Moving to slide 20, I'd like to close with a few thoughts. We made a commitment to our investors in March. We said we would cover the dividend from free cash flow in 2017. We stand by that commitment. We are taking the steps necessary to ensure we are a resilient competitor regardless of the ensuing price environment. Our focus areas are shown on the slide, get our capital projects currently under construction online, rebase and reprioritize our capital outflows, maintain reliability and drive our cost structure lower, and conclude our planned divestment program. If a lower price environment persists for longer, you'll see even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital. As we showed you in March, we have tremendous flexibility in our 2017 C&E spend. We are confident that we can and are committed to scaling our C&E outflows in a manner that will allow us to continue our 27-year record of annual dividend payment increases. So that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in. We're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if necessary. And we'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. And once again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please? Jason D. Gammel: Yes. Thanks very much. First of all, if I could just ask on Gorgon. Jay, you mentioned the key risks still to getting to the first commercial cargo included labor risks, and there has been a lot of media attention to the \u2013 one of the unions that is employed by one of your primary contractors. Do you have any update on any industrial actions that could prevent getting that first commercial cargo in early 2016? James William Johnson : Thanks for the question. At this point, the work with the contractors and the unions to agree a new contract is ongoing. The discussions continue. There was a fourth vote that was unsuccessful recently, and so the unions have requested and received permission to seek a strike vote, but there is warning time that has to occur before that happens. At this point in time, any action that would occur would be relatively short in duration, 24 hours or less, and we would have ample warning time before that would occur. But I think it's important to recognize that a strike at this point is really not going to be in anyone's benefit and so the negotiations continue between our contractors and the unions, and I'm optimistic that they will be able to find a solution and a way forward. I think the issues have largely been addressed. The primary one appears to be just around work schedules, and so that's an area that's receiving quite a bit of focus as we move forward. Jason D. Gammel: Okay. Appreciate that. If I could, just as a follow up, ask a question about the charges that were recorded in the quarter for project suspension. Would you be able to give us any examples of projects that are being deferred and the level of CapEx savings that's being associated with these deferrals? James William Johnson : We really aren't going to go into any specific projects that have been deferred, but as we look at our pre-FID capital, the projects that have not moved to sanction, we're really looking to do either deferments as we slow them down to take advantage of the current market environment, build lower cost structure into this projects. We're also looking to pace those projects as we build our capital programs looking ahead to 2016 and 2017. But some projects that we feel are not going to be competitive rather than keep them moving we've just elected to go ahead and suspend those and those costs reflect some of those projects that we've suspended. Jason D. Gammel: Okay. Thanks for your thoughts, Jay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please? Phil M. Gresh: Hey. Good morning, everyone. James William Johnson : Good morning. Phil M. Gresh: First question, I appreciate the additional color on the operating cost reduction potential and if we think about the capital cost side, looking at your Analyst Day deck, you had a grey bar with respect to capital costs of about $20 billion in 2016, so I guess I'm just wondering like how much reduction potential is there from a deflation standpoint, a deferral standpoint, and really if you kind of wrap it all together with the operating costs, your guidance at the Analyst Day suggested that you could cover your dividend at $70. So how low do you think that could go given where we are in this current oil price environment? Patricia E. Yarrington: So I think there's two elements there. Let me just start with the last component here. Really, we did say we would cover our dividend from free cash flow at the $70 price. What I was trying to indicate in my earlier words is we intend to cover the dividend from free cash flow at whatever the ensuing price is. That is a firm commitment on the part of the company, and we have tremendous flexibility, really, in our 2017 C&E to flex that down. We are being very successful in driving our operating costs lower and working through the supply chain to accomplish not only operating expense but capital reductions as well. And that really is an affordability component for us. It's a cash flow management element for us, and after we get these projects that are currently under construction online, that flexibility in C&E becomes quite significant in 2017. So I'll let Jay talk to his prioritization process in terms of looking at the capital program in 2017. James William Johnson : So as we're building \u2013 we're in the process of building our plan right now for 2016, 2017, and 2018. And as we go through, as we've said before, our primary focus first and foremost is on putting the investment back into our base business around asset integrity and maintaining good, reliable operations. And then we also fund the major capital projects that are in execution and as you have seen in our slides, that will decrease significantly as these projects come online. Just for example, in our LNG projects, this year we expect to spend around $8 billion in LNG, C&E, but by 2017, that's down to $1 billion. So we'll see tremendous flexibility coming in just from that. At the same time, we're looking at our base business, and as I mentioned, we are bringing our costs down, our efficiencies up, so we're seeing very good performance out of our base business and able to compete even in this environment. So we're evaluating how much money to put back into the base to maintain and continue to grow, particularly the short cycle, high value returns. And then finally, we're looking at the projects that are pre-FID, and as I said, we want to build in the lower cost structures, and we want to be able to preserve the option so that as prices recover, we can decide at what pace and how to ratably bring these projects back into the program. Moving engineering forward so that we have better definition, better understanding of these projects is a very low-cost way to build more confidence into our program for the future. And the last area is our exploration. We've been very successful in the last several years, so we've built up a bit of an inventory on the resource side, and so we can pull back on exploration over the next couple of years as we consolidate and wait for prices to recover. So I would see a dramatic and significant reduction in capital as we move forward. We're building that into our plans but the exact amount is yet to be determined. Phil M. Gresh: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question in just in light of the commentary about Big Foot, some of the risks around Gorgon and Wheatstone, maybe you could just discuss your degree of confidence with the 3.1 million barrels a day production target for 2017 at this point, and to what degree you might be able to quantify what you see as the downside risk, because I know there was some cushion in that at one point, but maybe just kind of update us with your latest thoughts on that? Thanks. James William Johnson : We still feel very confident about the growth we're going to deliver, and that's primarily because the growth is captured and driven by these major capital projects that are currently in execution. And as I said, we'll continue to fund those and bring those to completion. So that growth is there, it's real, and it's based on our underlying base business performance, which has been very strong, and we've done a good job of being able to maintain our underlying decline rates. But we're in a different world, and so we're seeing costs change, obviously as the cost \u2013 or prices structures have come down, costs are moving, and so just as we did with North American gas, there's still opportunity to make adjustments in how we continue to invest in some of the shorter cycle opportunities. So I see us as having a very strong base. The growth, we're very confident with that. The level of the divestment, the level of base business, those can be some factors that go into it, but on balance, we are very strong on the growth prospect and the growth story that we presented to you. Phil M. Gresh: Okay. Thanks. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please? Edward Westlake : Yes. Good morning. So maybe a small question to begin with. Just obviously Big Foot delay and then you're talking about extra fab space for Wheatstone and extra beds, I presume that the CapEx impact that you might be able to speak to or not and then obviously would you be able to offset that with the cost reduction efforts that the industry is going through? James William Johnson : Thanks. That's a good question. With Wheatstone, when you put extra beds in, there are some costs associated with that. At the same time, because the modules were delayed, we didn't build up the manpower initially as we had originally planned, so there were some savings early on. But in general, we're facing cost pressure on the projects just as we are around the world. At the same time, we're seeing very favorable exchange rates in Australia that are a countervailing force to that. So we're still working under the cost forecast that we've already provided to you. We'll continue to monitor that and see how we progress through the next 18 months, and we'll update you if we feel costs have changed significantly. Edward Westlake : Right. And then this is a broader question. There was a period where Chevron had very good project execution, and then there have been, obviously, some well publicized setbacks more recently. If there was one change or one message that you were trying to get to investors and to the organization about how to hold on to better project execution, what would that message be, and is there any anecdotes or data to illustrate that that is changing? James William Johnson : That's also a good question. I think what we have seen, some degradation in terms of performance, and it's driven by a couple of things. One, the projects have been very large and complex. In and of itself, that's not just something that should be difficult to manage, but because of the number of projects being simultaneously managed I think both the industry's resources were stretched thin as well as our own resources to manage these projects was stretched thin. As we now consolidate and finish this big wave of projects that drives the growth that we have, roughly 20% from 2014 to 2017, we won't see that kind of sustained effort to maintain that growth going forward. It'll be at a much more moderate pace. So I think we'll have the more ratable queue of projects back into the range that's more straightforward to manage. At the same time, we're also working to lower the cost structures and increase the predictability of these projects by advancing engineering before we move them to FID. So as I mentioned on many of our pre-FID projects such as FGP, we talked in March about advancing the engineering past 50%, that 40% to 50% range by the time we take FID. Just as an example, you're looking for a proof point, when we took Gorgon to FID, we had modeled 12-inch pipe and larger in our 3D CAD models at the time of FID. FGP will have 3-inch and larger pipe in our system and sketches done for everything below that. So there's a great deal more definition in the design before we're moving these projects forward. So I think the combination of having a more ratable program along with better engineering, more advanced, higher-quality engineering will pay dividends for us. Edward Westlake : Thanks, Jay. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please? Paul Y. Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Paul Y. Cheng: Jay, if I could, two questions. If you're looking at a company the scope and size of Chevron on a going-forward basis \u2013 historically that you spend most of your capital in the long cycle macro development, how is that going to change, and is there \u2013 may be a sweet spot how that's going to shift between the short cycle and long cycle development effort going forward? James William Johnson : Yes. I think as you look at projects like the Wheatstones, the Gorgons, the FGPs and TCO, these are projects that will add very large base and very long term assets to our portfolio. As we execute our small capital projects, which are often infill drilling programs, work-over programs and de-bottlenecking, we typically see rates of return above 50%, and they're built on these assets, we've already made the investments. So I think we're really doing a good job of rejuvenating our base and putting some new life into the base that we can continue to exploit over a long period of time, but at the same time we're building our capability day by day in our ability to go after the shale and tight largely in North America and in Argentina. So as you've seen our performance numbers continue to increase, we're coming down that learning curve and we're becoming more and more competitive, and it's going to give us a very good balance between deepwater projects, large base projects in the LNG and sour gas as well as access to the shorter cycle of shale and tight unconventional projects. So I see a very good balance and a very good diverse portfolio (39:21). Paul Y. Cheng: Is there a percentage that you can share that on the going forward basis there was that capital spend between the long and the short cycle going to look like? James William Johnson : At this point in time, I don't have a ratio or a percentage to share with you. Our resource base has increased about 15%. Our portfolio has increased in the unconventional side by about 15% over the last five years in particular. So we're seeing more of our resource base being the unconventionals but the unconventionals have very high, very fast decline rates, and that is always going to be something we balance against the longer-term projects with their stable production. So that's something we'll work through as we react to market conditions, our view of forward pricing and the capital that we want to invest across the portfolio. Paul Y. Cheng: The second question is that, Jay, going back to your early comment, not just Chevron, it looked like the whole industry the last maybe 10 years has got openly optimistic about their capability to deliver and execute. And so, it seems like everyone is stretching themselves to the limit and we start seeing all these execution issues. For Chevron, learning from the mistake of the last several years, have you changed the way \u2013 I mean you are talking a little bit about more definition. But at the top how have you changed the investment decision process on the FID? Will you be \u2013 I mean in the future \u2013 in the past the industry tends to just looking at the financial capability and whether that you can afford the project and whether it is a good project. How that is going to change in the future particularly for Chevron ? James William Johnson : For Chevron, we have traditionally looked at individual products and the economic opportunity each project presents in making an investment decision. I would say now in the current environment and looking forward, there'll be two additional lenses that will be added to that decision. First and foremost, the project and the economic proposition it presents, but then we'll be looking at what is the overall level of investment we want to be making and also what is the level of human capacity we have to manage the projects? And those will certainly be factors that we will build into the process, and we are building into the process now so that we can keep that as we move forward. We've also done a lot of work to put in what we call readiness reviews, and these are to make sure that both from a design and a design assurance standpoint before the project moves to execution but also before we start up these projects, we're going to readiness review that are much more rigorous and help us make sure we have the resources and the capabilities in place to execute these projects as expected. Paul Y. Cheng: Thank you. James William Johnson : Thanks. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe if I could do one follow-up on the costs, on the slide you have there, on slide 19, there is the $3 billion and spend reduction targeted. I'm not sure if I miss it when you said it, but is this all, is the CapEx and OpEx, is that all in the OpEx side? Can you estimate how much you've captured to date, how far along you are at this point? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so the combination of the $3 billion is for both operating expense and capital. The $1.4 billion is predominantly going to be operating expense, and the $1.6 billion is going to be a mixture of both and probably leaning a little bit more towards the capital side of things. And from a \u2013 and these are elements that should begin to show in an accelerated basis as we move through the third and the fourth quarter. I would say captured to-date actually has been some but not a high proportion of the $3 billion total. Ryan Todd : Okay. And is there a timing on when you hope that this \u2013 something you hope to capture over the next year or two years or...? Patricia E. Yarrington: Oh, I think it will be more immediate than that. I mean think it will be into the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015 with some carryover into 2016 as well. I mean, a large portion of the supplier engagement element there, a billion dollars of that are negotiated price reductions off of planned 2015 activity. So those negotiations began, as you know, back in the January, February timeframe, we're sort of concluded in the May, June timeframe and so those rate reductions we should begin to see coming forward in the next half of the year. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then maybe if, I appreciate the color that you gave earlier on Big Foot and the contribution of Big Foot to the 2016 and 2017 plans. Could you maybe give the same numbers for what \u2013 in the 2017 plan, let's assume for the Partitioned Zone, and Angola LNG and maybe any updates you have on both of those projects? James William Johnson : Sure. And first I'll start with the PZ. The PZ, at this point in time, we have around 60,000 barrels a day to 70,000 barrels a day expected in the 2017 plan but we do not expect that field to still be shut in, in 2017. So my expectation is that we will be able to resume operations. There is an issue that's being discussed between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The impact on us is the difficulty receiving visas and equipment permits. So we were unable to continue operations and we stopped operations there as this issue is addressed. Our goal would be to return to normal operations in the short term as the \u2013 any other issues are continued to be worked out between the two governments. And so we work and we're trying to support the activities in that area accordingly. In terms of the ALNG, progress is moving along quite well there. We are completing the work on all the piping modifications, you recall this is as a result of the acoustic-induced vibration analysis that was done, so that work should be finishing up in the month of August, and then that will allow us to start the recommissioning process at the plant. The other work, in terms of the conditioning equipment on the front end of the plant to handle the diversity of the associated gas feeding the plant will be complete as are the technical bulletins. But we would expect to see restart late the year and then sustain production in 2016 and onward. So that's really the status of those two projects. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you very much. I'll leave it. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ryan. Patricia E. Yarrington: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please? Neil S. Mehta: Good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. James William Johnson : Hi, Neil. Neil S. Mehta: So, Pat, I just want to talk philosophically about how you're thinking about the dividend and your strategy there. Didn't raise the dividend in the third quarter, but the way we read the comments was that we'd look for you to raise it here in the fourth quarter even if it's a nominal level, and it's a priority to continue to raise the dividend going forward. I just wanted to confirm that and then get your thoughts on the broader dividend strategy. Patricia E. Yarrington: A good question. So our broader dividend strategy hasn't changed. Our financial priorities haven't changed. Maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our absolutely number one objective. What has changed, though, is obviously our immediate financial environment, and so the board chose not to raise the dividend in this quarter. I think that's a prudent action at this point because we're not running as strongly, certainly, as we would like on both earnings and cash flow because of where commodity prices sit. And it's not \u2013 I would say it's probably we're not in a very stable either revenue or cost environment. We have a lot of fluidity on those two components here. I will say the board is very committed to growing the dividend and seeing our pattern of dividend increases every year materialize, but what's important here is that it's the annual dividend payment that has moved up every year. That doesn't mean you get an increase in the per share every single year, because we typically have moved them in the second quarter. So it's an annual dividend payment history that applies to the 27-year factor. So I think the board is committed to that. We are committed to that. So I would like to be able to say our entire objective is being able to grow the dividend when the time is appropriate. We don't want to get out over our skis. We want to do it in a manner and at a time when we can see that we can hold on to that increase, sort of in perpetuity. We don't want to put ourselves into a position where we're pushing things, where we are having to fund the dividend off the balance sheet for an extended period of time, so we'll do it as soon as the financials really allow us to get there. It is our number one priority, though. Neil S. Mehta: Thank you, Pat. And, Jay, a question for you around Latin America. Two regions in particular. Venezuela output generally seems to be very robust across the country. Curious what you're seeing there and if you can comment on your relationship with \u2013 just politically over there, and given some of the potential tensions? And then the outlook for Argentina as well, it looks like a very powerful resource, obviously a dynamic political situation there as well, but comments on both of those plays would be terrific. James William Johnson : The performance in both of those areas has been good, and our relationships with the government in both countries I'd characterize as very strong. We have a long history and we have worked hard to maintain both our performance and our relationships. In terms of the unconventional play in Loma Campana, we are seeing continued progress there. We have linked in that asset team, and they are tied to our North America asset teams, so there's good sharing of the information as we continue to move down the learning curve, as we gain knowledge from the industry and offset partners, we're plowing those back into the business, moving to consistent sets of metrics. So that drive to continue to improve in the unconventional space is being applied in Argentina as well. And so we're quite excited about that potential for that asset. Neil S. Mehta: Thank you, Jay. Thank you, Pat. Frank Mount : Thanks Neil. James William Johnson : Thank you. Neil S. Mehta: Thanks, Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please? Evan Calio : Good morning, everybody. I think you mentioned earlier the inability to slow offshore exploration spending in this current environment or in your outlook here. But can you quantify exploration spending in 2015 and 2016 from at least from an Analyst Day timeframe and discuss rate commitments that limit your flexibility into that timeframe. James William Johnson : Yeah, the Deepwater drilling that's going on in the Gulf of Mexico, of course, we have six rigs there, and it moves back and forth between exploration and appraisal. So as we have exploration success, than rigs get taken out of exploration and moved into more appraisal and development work. So for example, right now, we have, of the six rigs, four are working on production and development wells and two are working on appraisal wells, and we'll move some of those back into the exploration area. We currently expect to drill about 12, what we consider to be high-impact exploration wells around the world this year. We continue to see activity in West Africa, Deepwater West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico are two of our primary areas but we also have some other work in the unconventional going on as well. Evan Calio : Right. So it's more of a shifting then maybe a reduction on the rig side. James William Johnson : I think as we move forward, we're going to, on the rig side, we shift those back and forth. Of course, they're under long-term contracts, the large Deepwater rigs. But in terms of some of the unconventional work, those rigs are on shorter cycle, and we can move accordingly with our capital allocation. Evan Calio : Great. James William Johnson : Going forward, my comment was really around how much additional work we're going to put in outside of those committed Deepwater rigs. Evan Calio : Great, Jay. And since I have you while you're on the call, maybe a question on the Permian. Your EUR's are up 30% on the slides. Any color on the driver there, whether it's completion, lateral lengths, different zones? And maybe just generally within your portfolio, given the returns, I mean is this region a net receiver of more capital versus other areas where there may be more capital pressure in this environment? James William Johnson : Yeah, on the first question, I would say it's all of the above. As we're getting more effective in our drilling, we're learning a lot from our offset operators and we're moving, as you know, from vertical wells to horizontal wells, and our preference is to really be able to drill those 7,500 foot laterals. The IP rates are consistent with what we were hoping for. We're seeing high liquids content in Bradford Ranch. So everything's looking pretty positive there and when you combine that with the reductions we're getting from our cost of suppliers and the efficiencies, that's what's driving that 35% reduction and our development costs per barrel. I would say that as we look forward, we certainly see the Permian as a very lucrative area for us to continue to grow, but because so much of that acreage is held by fee, we have the luxury of being able to moderate and decide just how much we want to put in there and really can use that as a flywheel. As we put more infrastructure into the area, it really gives us increasing flexibility and profitability as we move forward. Evan Calio : Great. Thanks for your answers. Frank Mount : Thanks, Evan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. James William Johnson : Good morning. Doug Terreson : On the industry deflation theme, I wanted to see if Jay could comment on whether \u2013 Jay, whether you think the pace of cost capture that Chevron's experiencing is different between the U.S. and overseas markets, meaning is one of them lagging the other? And also, do you think it's reasonable to believe that the pace of cost productivity captured for larger companies like Chevron might lag that of smaller companies during this part of the cycle? James William Johnson : Good questions. I'll talk first about the U.S. versus International. Doug Terreson : Okay. James William Johnson : We have seen a faster response in cost reductions in the U.S. than in the international side. A lot of that's driven by the competitiveness of the U.S. market. There are more contractors out there, there are more service providers, and you can work and make transition from one to another faster if needed. As you get into the international environment, it varies country by country, but the barriers to entry can be much higher. There's often local content issues. Many of these companies may be in joint venture with local companies. So it just makes it more difficult sometimes to drive those costs lower in the short term. But what is happening is we're seeing the activity levels come off substantially, and as activity levels come off, we're seeing that drive the cost structure lower. So I think we will see, and particularly as low prices persist, we will see the international continue to come down. It just hasn't been at the rate that we've seen in North America. I'm sorry, the second part of the question? Doug Terreson : Yeah. And also, Jay, do think it's reasonable that larger \u2013 that the cost productivity capture for big companies like Chevron might lag that of the smaller companies during this part of the cycle? James William Johnson : Yeah. I think in North America the small companies can also drive costs down just as we do, because as I said, there's enough competition for provision of goods and services that they can make those switches just as we can. And so they can drive very, very rapid reductions in price. In the international area, what we're trying to do is really work as an enterprise so that we are working with our major suppliers and coordinating our efforts to drive those costs down around the globe. That's why I think a big company has some leverage that a small company wouldn't. We can work with these very large companies to drive those efficiencies, to make sure that our global contracts and terms and conditions support a lower cost structure. Doug Terreson : Okay. Patricia E. Yarrington: And I'd just add that I think because of our spend and our size, that gives us additional leverage that some of the smaller firms don't have. Doug Terreson : It seems like it would over some period. And then also, Jay, you talked about the neutral zone a few minutes ago and it's obviously been shut in for a few quarters. And I know it's hard to know whether the Saudis and the Kuwaitis are close to resolving their issues, but my question is if those fields were able to be brought back on stream, over what period of time do you think this could happen? Meaning is this something that could occur over months or is it quarters or is it a longer term period, given the extended nature of the shut in? So how do you think about that? James William Johnson : Well, the fields were shut in \u2013 the Wafra field was shut in, in mid-May. So that kind of gives the beginning of the timeframe. And obviously it depends on how long they remain shut in. If we were able to restart in the next couple of months, I think we'd be looking at probably like about a six-month ramp-up to get back into kind of normal operation. Obviously visas have to be issued, we have to get workers into the country, we have to get the facilities restarted. So we've been doing steadily since the facilities were shut in, preservation work to make sure that the facilities are protected and that we are ready for a restart. There's extensive planning around the restart. So I think as we work to get approval to restart that field it really just depends on how long it's going to take before that restart initiates. But at this point in time, we can restart in a relatively short period of time. Couple of quarters I would say. Doug Terreson : Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Yup. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please? Paul B. Sankey: Hi, everyone. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Paul B. Sankey: Hey. A follow-up just from earlier comments, and then I have a separate question. I wasn't quite clear what you're saying about the dividend. Did you say that the 27-year record is not of increases in per-share dividends but is an absolute payout? I think that's what...? Patricia E. Yarrington: It's an annual payment record, yes. Paul B. Sankey: So we're looking at the dollars that you pay out as an amount? Is that \u2013 that's the increase... Patricia E. Yarrington: That's correct. Paul B. Sankey: Okay. Patricia E. Yarrington: That's correct. Paul B. Sankey: Okay. So what you're saying is it may not increase on a per-share basis? Patricia E. Yarrington: Each year it may not. But the payment in each year has increased 27 years. Paul B. Sankey: Yeah, given all the moving parts here, if we could just \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed it, but are we still reiterating the $3.1 million a day for 2017, and is that changing with the asset sale element here? I'm not clear if you've increased your asset sale target. And I think your net asset sales from the $3.1 million a day, is that correct? And furthermore, is the cash flow neutrality target dependent on asset sales? And I'm again not clear if you've increased the asset sales. And finally, is the cash flow neutrality a number at which you keep volumes flat or you grow? Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so let me just go back and talk about the original objectives that we put out in 2017 and $70 oil and the cash flow neutrality. That \u2013 the assumption that we had in there was independent of asset sales, at the $70 price. Now depending upon where you go on price, I have indicated that we would continue to work our cost structure. We would continue to work our capital outlays. I think we also need to keep asset sales in the portfolio. It is an arrow in the quiver. It is a lever that we would have. And what we showed you back in March, we were cash flow neutral covering the dividend without asset sales in there. Depending upon where prices end, obviously I think that's a lever that we still need to have in the \u2013 available to us. James William Johnson : So when we gave you the SAM information in March, we had about 65,000 decrease from the 2014 to 2017 in asset sales. And that, as Pat said, can certainly change as we determine what the level of asset sales is going to be. But the $3.1 million is really driven by the major capital projects that are under construction that are going to be coming online. I think one of the key points was, as we also said in March, those volumes that are contributed are accretive from a cash margin standpoint. So as those projects come online, we still see that as the main driver of our growth, and then we just have to evaluate both from a divestment standpoint and any moderation in capital into the base, what the impacts of that might be. Paul B. Sankey: Okay. So we're sticking with the $3.1 million. It's not necessarily contingent. You're not adjusting for asset sales but neither are you adjusting for the project issues that you talked about in the call. The cash flow neutrality doesn't or does include asset sales and can you grow from there in 2017 if you are cash flow neutral? Thanks. James William Johnson : Yeah, I think from the standpoint that the $3.1 million is an outcome. It was $3.3 million, and as the North America gas pricing came substantially lower and we saw it staying lower, we pulled back some investment from North America gas and brought our target down accordingly. At this point, we're still at $3.1 million, we still have all these projects that are under construction and driving forward, but obviously, we just have to see if this very low price condition persists. It may have some impact. The $3.1 million is good a number as an outcome that I can drive it to at this point in time. In terms of going forward, we'll actually see our capital programs. We've talked about moderate quite a bit because we're not going to be trying to do the \u2013 and accomplish the organic growth that we're underway right now. So as we look forward, we're evaluating that now, we'll see some momentum continue. Projects like Gorgon have two trains that will come on, Trains two and Trains three and then the ramp ups that are associated with those Trains. Wheatstone will have a second Train coming on. We'll have some other projects that are still in the ramp up phase. So I see some momentum carrying past 2017. Those are also going to be strong volumes from a cash margin standpoint. And then as we look out into the next decade, a lot of that is going to depend on the options that we've been able to preserve and the degree to which we've moved to any of the pre-FID projects forward. That's part of the work that's undergoing now in our business plan. Paul B. Sankey: Okay. So I don't want to go on too much with it. But just a final specific, one with the cash neutrality does include asset sales. Patricia E. Yarrington: So in the $70 case, the answer was no, it did not. Depending upon what case you're going forward with here, a $60 case, a $50 case, whatever your case is, I want to preserve that degree of flexibility for us. Our primary levers are going to be getting our cost structure down and getting our capital program down for whatever price environment prevails out there. But depending upon where prices do go, I don't want to take off our available set of options. I don't want to take asset sales off that available set of options. Paul B. Sankey: Okay. I understand. Can I slip in another one? Why was the...? Frank Mount : You see, Paul, we're overtime. We got a couple of guys (01:03:43). Paul B. Sankey: Yeah. I'll let you go. Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please? Alastair R. Syme: Hi, everyone. Can I just ask on the impairment exactly what it was that triggered it? Is it just oil price or is it something about assets going up for sale or some geological review? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so... Alastair R. Syme: And can you can say what oil price it is? Patricia E. Yarrington: I can answer most of those questions here. The trigger really was a lowering of our corporate longer-term price outlook on crude oil. We took that action in May, and as you know, when there's a trigger event like that, we do need to run impairment tests on our assets. Any time there's a significant trigger, whether it be a reduced price outlook or increased costs or some change in the geology in the reserve or production profile, those are elements that when that trigger occurs we need to do the impairment reviews. And we have a process set up where we look at that every quarter. In this particular instance, the vast majority of the impairments related to Papa Terra, and that was a price-induced, crude oil price-induced impairment. We did have a couple of other smaller assets in this category as well where they were assets held for sale where we were writing it down basically to what we felt was the realizable value. Alastair R. Syme: And on the oil price? Is it possible to talk around that? Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. We're not going to give you our proprietary oil price. I can just say the revised outlook was really based on two factors. One had to do with the rate we were expecting of global GDP growth and in particular around China, so we've seen softening in China, and we've taken our view of that down accordingly. And the second major factor that lowered our overall price outlook had to do with the U.S. tight oil shale produceability. We've seen obviously much stronger production coming out of the U.S. and with the ingenuity and cost efficiency of the U.S. industry we've seen costs continue to fall, and economics of those barrels continue to rise, and so that puts more supply onto the market place. And so it's those two factors that's led us to lowering our longer term price outlook. Alastair R. Syme: Right. And finally, is really anything taken on Big Foot other than the impairment or in the suspension, project suspension (01:06:07)? Patricia E. Yarrington: No. Nothing of any material size, no. Alastair R. Syme: Okay. Thank you very much. Frank Mount : Thanks, Alastair. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thank you, and, guys, thanks for letting the call run over. I really appreciate you letting that. I just want to get on with the end here. I guess I wanted to kind of follow up on a couple of things that Paul mentioned. I really had two specifics. But $11 billion out of $15 billion on disposals, what is your thought on raising disposal target at this point given that you've still got two and a half years left in the program? It would seem you've got a lot of upside potentials. So that's my first. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. And we're not in a position to move that target at this point. We just moved that target back in March. We feel very good about the assets that we've been able to move forward and the value that we have captured for that. So we have a number of assets kind of lined up in our own mind about how we could meet that $15 billion target over the next several months, 18 months or so. But it really will depend on whether or not that value is capturable. And we're not going to just sell the asset for the sake of meeting a target. We want to capture value while we do it. So I'm not in a position to raise that target at this point. We feel good about where we sit. When we get to March of next year, if we have a different view, we'll update it at that time. Doug Leggate : Appreciate it. My follow up, and I guess last question of the call is on Gorgon, not so much on the timing of the startup, I think Jay's been pretty clear on that, but the timing of getting to full capacity because obviously the cash flow delta that comes from the slowdown in spending versus the cash flow contribution is quite important. And I guess what I am getting at is if everyone is really starting to think lower for longer, what does the cash contribution look like and how long does it take to get to full capacity? So, I don't know how you want to try and answer that, but if you could help us with the contribution from Gorgon when it does come on, that would be \u2013 Gorgon (01:08:18) that would be very helpful. James William Johnson : So our current view on Gorgon is that each Train, the second Train should start up about seven months after the first Train and then followed by four to six months for the third Train. And it should take around eight months on the first Train to get to capacity is our plan, and then six months for Trains 2 and Trains 3. So you can kind of put all that together to get a rough profile of what Gorgon's going to look like coming forward. And even in the lower price environment the cash generation that it has is still substantial, so we're looking forward to getting that cash on stream. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I think that was our last call. I want to thank everybody for your time and attention here this morning, and I'll turn it back to you, Jonathan.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead. John S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and CFO, who you know very well, and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you read that cautionary statement that is on slide 2. I will now turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through our financials, briefly. Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thanks, John. I'll be presenting four slides on third quarter results. Our normal earnings and production variance slides are available in the appendix section of the presentation, which is available on our website. Starting now with slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. Third quarter earnings were $2 billion, or $1.09 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and impairments, earnings totaled $1.9 billion, or $1.01 per share. On this basis, third quarter results were modestly better than second quarter, despite a much weaker oil market. This reconciliation is also available in the appendix. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.4 billion. Our debt ratio at quarter end was just under 19%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we declared a $1.07 per share dividend, payable in the fourth quarter. This takes our 2015 annual dividend to $4.28 per share and makes 2015 the 28th consecutive year where we have increased annual per-share dividend payments. Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $5.4 billion during the third quarter and nearly $15 billion year-to-date. Downstream cash generation strength was sustained in the third quarter, while upstream cash flow fell, commensurate with an approximate 20% drop in global oil prices between quarters. As of September 30th, working capital effects reduced 2015 operating cash flow by $2.3 billion. Year-to-date proceeds from asset sales were $5.4 billion, bringing our total over the last seven quarters to more than $11 billion. We are tracking very well against our four-year asset divestment target of $15 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $6.8 billion for the quarter, $800 million lower than second quarter. Year-to-date cash capital expenditures were $22 billion, down $3.6 billion or 14% compared to the same period in 2014. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were $13.2 billion, and our net debt position was $22.6 billion. Debt issuance through nine months has amounted to $8 billion. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2015 earnings were approximately $3.6 billion lower than third quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $4.6 billion between quarters, virtually all of this related to significantly lower realizations between periods. Downstream results increased by $824 million, primarily driven by higher margins and favorable foreign exchange effects, partially offset by the absence of third quarter 2014 gains on asset sales. The variance in the other segment was mainly lower environmental reserve additions, in particular, the absence of a reserve taken last year in the third quarter related to a closed mining operation. I will now compare results for the third quarter 2015 with the second quarter of 2015. Third quarter earnings were $1.5 billion higher than second quarter results. Upstream earnings increased by 2.3 billion, primarily reflecting the absence of second quarter impairments and other related charges worth $2.6 billion. Lower realizations reduced earnings between quarters, but a favorable swing in foreign exchange and lower exploration expenses were largely offsetting. Downstream earnings decreased $745 million, mainly due to the absence of a $1.7 billion in asset sale gains recorded in the second quarter. The current quarter also saw stronger margins and volumes, particularly in the U.S., favorable foreign exchange impacts, as well as lower operating expenses and positive timing effects in the face of declining prices. The variance in the other segment was primarily unfavorable tax items, partially offset by lower corporate charges. John will now provide an update on the current priorities and focus areas. John S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 7, I would like to start by reinforcing that our priorities \u2013 financial priorities are unchanged. Our first priority is to maintain the dividend and grow it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. As Pat mentioned, we announced our quarterly dividend earlier this week and are very proud of the fact that we've increased the annual per-share payout for 28 consecutive years. Back in March, we committed to delivering free cash flow to cover the dividend in 2017. At that time, the futures market was envisioning $70 prices in 2017. Today, the futures market is lower, but our intent remains the same. Our goal is to balance our cash equation by completing projects under construction and reducing capital spend and operating expenses to levels consistent with the current market conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain good value. We will achieve this while operating all businesses safely and reliably. I'll address each topic on this slide on the slides that follow. First, a little bit of an overview on the market. It's clear that low prices have reduced upstream earnings for the sector, and, for Chevron, we're no exception. Prices are low because the market is producing more than consumers want, but the markets are showing signs of rebalancing. Using Wood Mac data, this chart depicts worldwide liquid supply with the black line and demand in red. The blue represents the shortfall from or surplus to inventory. In the early part of the decade, the pattern was clear. Supply could not keep up with demand, in part because of supply disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa. The success of shale in the U.S. and some growing production from Iraq allowed the market to rebalance for first several months of 2014. However, note the spike in production when the Saudis increased production and the shale growth continued its surge in late 2014. The resultant 2 million barrels per day surplus has pushed prices down. Suppliers are adjusting. World production peaked and turned down last month. U.S. production, particularly shales, has peaked and is now in decline. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate at current prices. Demand is strong, as low prices provide stimulus to the consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere, leading to annual growth of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day. Markets will likely rebalance at some point next year, though seasonal demand patterns are apt to blur the exact timing. With a new equilibrium will come price recovery, which is one of the levers that will help balance our cash equation. While we're confident in a price recovery, the timing, of course, is uncertain. We're taking actions that will allow Chevron to compete effectively in a low price environment while positioning us effectively for value growth over the longer term. Turn to slide 9. A second lever to help us balance cash flow is volume growth. As most are aware, we expect to see a significant inflection point over the next two years as a number of major capital projects move from being cash consumers to cash generators. Gorgon and Wheatstone are obvious contributors, but the list is long, starting with Lianzi in West Africa. Over the next several quarters, we expect a progression of start-ups that will include Angola LNG, Mafumeira Sul, Moho Nord, Sonam \u2013 all these are in West Africa. Chuandongbei in China, the Bangka development in Indonesia, Alder in the North Sea, the Chevron fields chemical project on the U.S. Gulf Coast and, of course, three trains at Gorgon and two trains at Wheatstone. Our strong shale and tight portfolio, particularly in the Permian, gives us low-cost, short-cycle investment opportunities that nicely supplement production growth from the major capital projects. In the shale and tight class, our focus is on high grading our investment opportunities to maximize returns and cash flow. We like our portfolio diversity, which, when market conditions improve, will provide growth opportunities. In slide 10, we're in the final stages of commissioning systems to allow start-up of Train 1 at Gorgon. At the plant, our focus is on starting up the process units ahead of commencing liquefaction. An LNG cool down cargo is planned to arrive mid-December to assist in cooling down the LNG tanks and associated facilities prior to first LNG export. The Jansz-Io Field sub-C infrastructure is fully complete. We've opened the first two wells to the Jansz pipeline confirming the full operability of these sub-C systems. Our current outlook for loading the first LNG cargo is early 2016. We are continuing to make good progress on Trains 2 and 3, with all Train 2 and nine of 13 Train 3 modules installed and hookups under way. At Wheatstone, all sub-C infrastructure and over 100 kilometers of flowlines have been installed. Hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform continues on plan. All nine wells are drilled with the top of the reservoir, with four of nine wells now completed and sub-C trees installed. At the plant, 17 of the 24 modules required for first LNG have been delivered and all refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have been installed. Installation of all pipe racks and electrical switchgear buildings on the product loading facility is now complete, as is start-up of the power systems in the plant operations center. We're still targeting the first LNG cargo by year-end 2016, however we continue to work to mitigate Wheatstone schedule pressures from previous delays in module delivery. We've posted some new pictures today, and I encourage you to look at them on our investor website at Chevron.com. Turn to slide 11. Another lever to deliver free cash flow is reduce capital spending. As indicated during our March Analyst Day, we have significant flexibility in our capital program as we complete projects under construction. Given the near-term price outlook, we're exercising more discretion and pacing projects that have not reached final investment decision. We are also negotiating cost reductions from suppliers. Overall, our investment programs are being set at levels that will enable us to complete and ramp-up the projects under construction, fund high-return, short-cycle investments, preserve options for viable, long-cycle projects, and finally ensure safe, reliable operations. We expect capital exploratory spend in 2016 to be in the range of $25 billion to $28 billion, down from $35 billion this year. We expect further reductions in 2017 and 2018 into the $20 billion to $24 billion range depending on business conditions. Of specific note, the plan does include funding for the wellhead pressure management and future growth project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, which has undergone rigorous engineering and readiness reviews based on learnings from other projects. Turn to slide 12, to another cash flow improvement lever. We're working on reducing cost across the company and are beginning to see the results. Compared to prior-year day periods, enterprise operating costs are 7% lower. In the third quarter to third quarter comparison, they're 12% lower. On another basis, year-to-date upstream unit operating expenses are down 13% versus last year. At this point, we have identified spend reductions of approximately $4 billion on an annual full run rate basis. About half of this is coming through organizational reviews and portfolio rationalization. And about half working through the supply chain. On the organizational side, lower investment activity, portfolio changes and efficiency reviews across the upstream, gas and midstream and the corporate and service company groups are expected to result in employee reductions of between 6,000 to 7,000. A similar number of contractor reductions are anticipated over the same period. Supply chain initiatives including rate reductions, greater equipment standardization, project re-scoping, and timing optimization are expected to contribute approximately$2 billion also on an annual run rate basis. An example, we're leveraging our enterprise spend for drill pipe across the company and we're seeing cost reductions of up to 35%. These supply chain benefits will show up as lower operating expense, lower capital expenditures, and lower cost to goods sold. Finally, we're seeing efficiency improvements throughout the organization, which are driving improved value capture. As an example, in the last year, we have seen the drilling cycle time from spud to rig release reduced by 55% within our Permian horizontal drilling program. Turning to slide 13, a final cash flow lever is asset sales. These are a normal part of portfolio work and contribute proceeds to help manage the balance sheet. We divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or where we no longer see the cost-effective application of our technology, where future investments do not compete for capital within our portfolio and where we can obtain good value. So there are a number of drivers on asset sales. As you know, we made a commitment to generate $15 billion from the asset sales program from 2014 through 2017, and over the last seven quarters, we made real good progress and achieved $11 billion of this goal. From today out through 2017, we could see another $10 billion in sales proceeds. There's a range around this new expectation because of uncertainties on future market conditions. We're only going to sell assets where we can obtain good value. Turn to slide 14. We expect to end this year within the production guidance range we provided back in January. Over the next couple of years, you will see the growth projects we've talked about for some time come onstream. Gorgon and Wheatstone and Angola LNG are collectively expected to provide the majority of our volume growth. This growth will not be realized at one time as there's a ramp-up over three years and there's variability depending upon start date. We expect offshore projects, the majority coming from West Africa, also to be a significant part of our growth. Our projected shale and tight ramp-up is steady, though the current price environment is expected to lead to a slower pace of growth than we anticipated at our March Analyst Day. Similarly, our future base business spending is influenced by the current environment and its impact on economics and partner funding capabilities. We anticipate lower base business spending and, as a result, expect to see higher decline rates compared to our more recent pattern. Under these assumptions, we're anticipating a 13% to 15% increase in production from year-end 2015 to a range of between 2.9 million and 3 million barrels per day in 2017. In 2018, we expect volume growth momentum to continue, largely because of project ramp-up schedules. Note, this range excludes the impact of divestments. Their specific timing is difficult to predict. Actual production growth is also dependent upon production sharing contract effects and the Partitioned Zone restart timing. We will issue further guidance for 2016 production as we normally would in January. Turning to slide 15, that brings me back where I started. We like the go-forward prospect for energy as we are constructive on the long-term price outlook, but sober about the current realities of lower prices. We have consistent and clear financial priorities. We are taking significant action to balance the cash equations and cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017. We expect to deliver volume growth and emerge on the other side of this downturn leaner and better. All of our actions are geared toward delivering value through dividend growth and stock price appreciation. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question come from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh: Hi. Good morning. John S. Watson: Good morning, Phil. Philip M. Gresh: John, thanks for the full update here. My first question is that one of the criticisms I continue to hear from investors about big oil is that most of the companies in the industry are just trying to manage two dividend coverage at a point in the cycle rather than through the cycle. And I fully appreciate Chevron has a full stable of capital projects over these past few years, so the spending flexibility is very high. But I was hoping you could just help us tie this new capital spending guidance to what kind of underlying capital spending would be required to keep production flat or what kind of long-term growth rate you think Chevron could achieve using this lower capital base? John S. Watson: It's a fair question. We do try to invest through the cycle. We got into a period at the early part of this decade where we had some good projects that were frankly stacked up on top of one another. We thought it was the right time to take Gorgon forward. We had good contracts in place. And, frankly, it was somewhat countercyclical when we started in 2009, very late in 2009. Wheatstone, very similar. We thought it was a good market and we needed to move that one as well. We also had Gulf of Mexico projects that following the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, came on \u2013 we started it at the same time. So we went through a period of capital spend that was pretty high. We thought these were very good projects, but there's no doubt that we were going through a period of heavy capital spend. And we kept our balance sheet pretty strong to enable us to withstand the ups and downs that we see in the market. Now, we saw prices rise dramatically, and then we've seen them come back down a little harder than we thought, so we do have to manage through this cycle. But I think we've been able to weather that pretty well. We are completing the projects that we've got. We're working to preserve the options that we have on some of the nice opportunities we have going forward. But we do have to live within our means here, and if you look at the \u2013 as you know very well, when we look at the pattern of dividends, it's a nice, smooth pattern with increases over 28 years. The pattern of earnings is a lot more volatile during that period, depending upon commodity prices. So we do invest through the cycle with some of these long projects, we have to be able to do that. But we have had a period of heavy spend for \u2013 that we've had to go through. So there is an adjustment when prices go from 100 to 50, and we're just having to deal with that. But, certainly, we're investing through the cycle, but making some adjustments to deal with the low prices we've got. Philip M. Gresh: And is there a specific growth rate you think you can achieve with this new spending base? John S. Watson: Well \u2013 certainly, we're going to see disproportionately strong growth through 2017, frankly, into 2018 that, we think, will be very good. Long-term, overall, hydrocarbons are growing in the 1% to 1.5% range. And so that's probably a more reasonable expectation going forward, but frankly we make our investment decisions based on what we can do that is economic. If you look at the history for companies our size, growing at something significantly greater than where aggregate demand for oil and gas is growing is pretty hard to do. And, frankly, we'll be guided by what we think we can do economically. We'll give you a little bit more information on what we think post-2017 as we finalize our business plan. We're still grinding \u2013 the reason we gave you a range on some of these capital numbers is we're still grinding through that business plan right now to be sure we strike the right balance, and that level of spending will dictate what the growth will be in some of the out years. Just so you have some confidence, though, I made specific comments on the future growth project, the Wellhead Pressure Management project in Tengiz, as one example of investing through the cycle. And that's a significant project, which we're working through final details with government and partner. But we're doing a lot of early work on that project, and that's one that, as we take final investment decision, we won't see the production from that until the next decade. And so that and other investments will provide growth going forward. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Phil. Philip M. Gresh: Sure, Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Y. Cheng: Thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning. Unknown Speaker : Good morning, Paul. Unknown Speaker : How are you doing, Paul? Paul Y. Cheng: Very good. Thank you. John, two questions. One is really short, and let me go for that first. With the \u2013 the CapEx is saying that the base operation decline rate will be higher. I think, for the last five years you guys have been about 3% to 4%. Do you have a new number for us? John S. Watson: Yeah. Actually, we've been better than that. Our base business has been more like 1%. It's been less than 2%, certainly, during that period, and we see it being more like 3%. And so, frankly, if you take just the difference between about 1% and 3% and apply it to our base level of production, you get a little bit lower production than you might have seen otherwise. Paul Y. Cheng: Okay. Excellent. Second one is a little bit more strategic, I think. If we look at hallmark for Chevron, it has always been on the LNG deepwater macro (00:23:47) project development. But I think the market is concerned, this type of development, there's a high-cost curve, has increasingly choose the last several years at the high end of the industry. And that also that the recent cost deflation that they have not seen as much comparing to the short cycle. So the question is that, do you agree with that view, and is concerned that the hallmark of the company what you're good at and of that to be at the high end of the supply cost curve? If you sort of agree with that, what initiative that Chevron is thinking to try to improve your cost curve position so that they will become, say, at the top quartile or top half at least. John S. Watson: Yeah. That is a philosophical question, and I'll give you a few comments. First, I think it's true that onshore costs have come down more than offshore costs. So I think that's just factually true, particularly in the United States, but also around the world. So rig rates and service costs, things of that sort. So that certainly is true. It's also true that some short cycle base business spend traditionally has lowered cost, once you have infrastructure in place, and it, certainly, is true that some of the shales are low cost. I think what's important, though, is if you step back and look at the market overall, it's a 95 million barrel a day market. The shales are about 5 million barrels a day. And there's a decline curve that's very rapid in the shales, of course, in every other producing asset. And it's going to take contributions from all asset classes to meet demand. And so we're going to need all forms of supply, and what we're doing is trying to take on cost reductions and get better everywhere to take costs down. And we've been able to do that. We've shown you some charts periodically, and \u2013 I mean offshore is about 25% of worldwide production and Deepwater production continues to grow and will continue to make contributions to worldwide supply. But if you look at drilling and completions technology, we've talked about things like the single-trip multizone frac pack, which is just a more efficient to get in and out of the hole to do work. If you look at ocean-bottom nodes work that we're doing, that really gives us better seismic imaging on the ocean floor, subsea systems and boosting technology. All these things are bringing cost down. In fact, in our Gulf of Mexico operations, our Deepwater, we've been able to reduce drilling days significantly. Our drilling days for 10,000 feet are down 25% over the last two years. So we've been able to take those costs down. And I think you're also likely to see the work that we did in the Gulf of Mexico to consolidate holdings, to create \u2013 for the industry to collaborate to create hub class developments will also help with economies of scale. So I think you'll see bigger hubs, but I think all classes of assets, at the current low prices, will have some spending that will fall out. So it's \u2013 some of your points are true, but I think costs \u2013 you'll see costs over time come down everywhere, and, of course, these projects are over a long period of time. LNG are 40-year projects, so you have a different lifecycle to these things as well, which can impact \u2013 some long-cycle LNG tend to be \u2013 because they're long-cycle, tend to be a little bit lower than \u2013 in RORs, but they have a very long life and cash flow. So they have a little bit different characteristic to them. Paul Y. Cheng: Thank you. John S. Watson: Thanks, Paul. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for all of the color. Just on the opening remarks, I think you said slower ramp-up on projects. So I presume that's going to be LNG, just looking at the cartoon which you put in the presentation in terms of LNG volumes. Maybe just a bit of a color around Gorgon and Wheatstone. Thanks. John S. Watson: Well, we said that the ramp-up would take place over time. The key is getting them started and getting first LNG and then the ramp-up will take place over time. So, I think, all I was trying to say with the ramp-up is that they will take place over the next three years. My comment wasn't so much about the ramp-up as it was that there will be a start date. Just in terms of what we're expecting, I indicated that Gorgon will see first cargo in the first quarter. I had updates yesterday afternoon on both Gorgon and Wheatstone, and I was pleased with the progress that I heard. I gave you some of the kind of key points that \u2013 the kind of proof points to where we're headed there. ALNG will start up early next year as well. I mean there's no secret that this has been a challenge, as we work through some of the engineering issues, but once that gets started, I think we've addressed some of the engineering issues that we encountered. There were also some technical bulletins that were issued by the technology owner. We took care of those, as well, during this downtime. So ALNG will start up early next year as well, and my update on Wheatstone, the key issue there has been module delivery. We had some modules out of Malaysia that were late. The team is working very hard to mitigate schedule there, and what I mean by that is, with some delay in modules, we're really now looking at both construction timing and some of the start-up and commissioning work that will need to be done. We've taken a close look at all the other projects that have been done in Australia and elsewhere, on the East Coast of Australia and Gorgon, and really looking to see if we can take time \u2013 taking time out of those schedules by really taking all the best practices that were effective in those projects to keep us back on a fourth quarter 2016 start-up schedule. So the work is progressing well. The point in having a range on production is really that a quarter one way or another when you've got projects that go up to 200,000 barrels a day at full capacity makes a difference. And so it's just reflecting that reality. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yeah, okay. Second question's on cash flow, maybe for Pat or John. So you can see this year you've done $17.2 billion before working capital so you could gross that up and say $23 billion. Obviously, you've got these new projects, so they'll add cash. And your cash CapEx is going down. So your overall group CapEx is going down to $20 billion to $24 billion. So you can see how the dividend is sustainable in sort of this year's condition. So that works fine. It's still a long way away from the cash flow that was presented a few years back at higher oil prices. So I guess my question is, is there anything this year in the cash generation of the company that you feel has underperformed? Because I guess the downstream has been pretty strong. Maybe it's start-up costs in some of these projects. John S. Watson: No. Actually, I think if you look at our cash flow, and the rule of thumb that we gave you for the effective oil prices was roughly $350 million after tax in earnings and cash flow for every dollar per barrel. And you multiply it by the change in barrel, I'd think you'd find that our cash flow is better than what you might expect by that rule of thumb. Now, we're trying to diminish that or reduce that rule of thumb by taking on costs and other things to get better at what we do, but I think you'd find that between those rules of thumb for oil and gas, I think you'd find that it's pretty consistent with that. And in fact, it's better because our downstream has performed so well. So I mean the grim reality is when you have on oil prices in the $40s, as we saw in the third quarter, as you look across the sector, particularly in the United States, it's tough sledding. And if you've got natural gas prices where they are in the U.S., it's a challenge. But we're taking it on by reducing costs. You saw some of the pretty aggressive actions that we're taking around the world to size the organization at the right level, and we think if we get some recovery in prices, you'll see a nice pop from that. But I can't control prices. I can only control my costs and spend. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) So it's just oil sensitivity. I understand. Thanks. John S. Watson: Great. Thanks, Ed. Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please. Jason D. Gammel: Yes, thanks very much. Hi, everyone. You've already touched on a lot of drivers here, John. But I was just trying to reconcile the new production range of 2.9 to 3.0 relative to the 3.1 million barrels a day that was presented at the analyst meeting. And I wasn't really clear rather the Partitioned Zone was included in the 2.9 to 3.0 or rather it's out, because that's obviously a big reconciling factor. And then how much of it would essentially just be production being pushed into 2018 versus an actual lower production figure from declines? John S. Watson: Yeah, there are lots of effects that are in there. First off, the biggest effect in the change versus what we've talked about previously was my comment on declines. You can't take \u2013 depending on which numbers in the range you want to use, we've taken $15 billion of capital out of the business in the go-forward projections from 2016 and 2017 in total. And that impacts, as I said, base decline. So if you add 2% to the decline, that's 100,000 barrels a day over a couple of years. So that's number one. But to answer your question about the Partitioned Zone, that production a year ago was roughly 80,000 barrels a day. And if you look at where we expect it to be in 2017, it was somewhere under 70,000 barrels a day. And that is included in both estimates. We expect to be back online by that time. I just returned from the Middle East, and I'll tell you, this has been pretty perplexing to me why we remain shut-in. You have two great allies in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait who are having a disagreement over administrative matters in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's in the Kuwaiti portion of the zone. And so, they administer work visas, equipment permits and things like that, and they stopped issuing them. And so we ended up shutting in May, and so we've lost the better part of 80,000 barrels a day net to our production. The reason I think production will come back is because the Kuwaitis themselves are actually being hurt by shutting in a gross amount of 200,000 barrels a day, half of which is theirs. They are hurt; Chevron is hurt, but Saudi Arabia is able to increase production elsewhere. So I think there's motivation for the Kuwaitis to begin issuing work permits and allowing work to continue while whatever disputes are resolved. And our plan is for that production to come back by 2017. In terms of other factors that are out there, we are high-grading some of the investment that we're doing in the shales, so while the growth profile will be nice, it'll be a little lower. Certainly, in the gas area, we've curtailed spending. We have really gotten our costs down very well in the Marcellus. We can compete with anybody there now. But nobody makes money, that I'm aware of, at $1.50 gas, which is where we are now. And futures prices remain low. So we can compete with anybody, but for the time being, we're scaling back investment there. So these are the kinds of effects that we've rolled in as well as schedule and timing of projects. A notable change from where we had been previously, of course, is Bigfoot, which we show no production in 2017 for. Jason D. Gammel: Okay. That's obviously a big factor, then. Great. And John, just as a follow up. I think you kind of answered this in your response here, but if I'm looking at the capital spend slide in the analysts meeting, I was looking at $32 billion or so of capital spend in 2016 with some flexibility around that. Is the incremental flexibility that you've identified in the numbers you put forward today mostly coming out of that base investment, which is why you're seeing the higher decline curves? John S. Watson: It's a little bit of both. At $70, when we presented the information that we did to you earlier, that was with the expectation that we would be able to take costs out and that certain projects would continue. So we had funding in the out years. I mean, again, some of it was ultimately discretionary around certain projects. Some of that has been removed or deferred in some cases. And that's just reflecting the realities that we're seeing lower prices. So there's some in large projects, but there is also a good chunk of it that's coming in the base investment area. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Jason. Jason D. Gammel: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning, John. John S. Watson: Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : John, I'm wondering how the \u2013 first of all, you've given a lot of information this morning. We really appreciate that, so thank you for all the disclosure. But when we get to 2017, let's assume your prognosis on oil prices or at least the supplied line balance is a little bit more optimistic. How does Chevron's sort of strategic go-forward view change in terms of, perhaps, reupping into another round of large scale projects of which you clearly have plenty of options versus being with the short cycle, I guess, flexibility until it sorts itself out? And what was really at the back of mind is I'm curious if you feel that you've got a big enough footprint to offer you that kind of flexibility. And I've got a quick follow-up, please. John S. Watson: Yeah, it's a very fair question. I commented a little bit earlier, as you know well, Doug. We went through this period with a number of projects stacked on top of one another. I don't think you'll ever see something like that in our \u2013 it was a series of circumstances that got us in that position. I don't think you're likely to see that. We do have a good queue of projects. I talked about the Anchor discovery which could mature into a project, and we've got others. So we'll take the best of those projects and move them forward. But I think on balance you'll see a higher proportion of shorter cycle spend. Five to seven years ago, we didn't really have a good understanding of our Permian basin position, for example. So you will see, over time, additional monies that will go to the shale developments. I mentioned that I had some reviews in my business units yesterday. I also had reviews with my four shale organizations, which are nicely sharing their successes. And the Permian is doing well. I mentioned the Marcellus is doing very well. The Duvernay in Canada, they've taken the practices and implemented them very quickly to get down the cost curve, and we're working closely with YPF and trying to put those same practice in place. We've delineated, we know where the sweet spots are down there. Now we're starting a horizontal drilling program, and we expect to get better. But I think you'll see a more balanced portfolio, and I think you'll see projects that will have good economics at moderate prices, as we work to standardize and take costs down. So we'll have some optionality in the portfolio. And I just \u2013 I can't envision having two big LNG projects at the same time. The Tengiz project is a significant capital project, but I don't see anything like having two Gorgon and Wheatstones plus several Deepwater developments stacked on top of one another. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer, John. My follow-up is, really, it's kind of on the head count reduction and the fact that you are now getting to the point where these major developments are coming onstream. Are there any portfolio consequences of having to amortize or rationalize a smaller head count across a much larger portfolio? And, of course, the tail changes when Gorgon and Wheatstone come on. So I'm just wondering if outside of the disposals you've given us so far, is there another round of portfolio restructuring that we should maybe look for at some point in Chevron's future? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John S. Watson: Yeah, there are some changes that will happen in the portfolio. First, just a general comment on the people reductions. One of the large areas for reductions is in Australia. As we ramp down these projects, obviously, you need fewer people. That was known, and in most cases, we had \u2013 Australia has a provision for fixed-term employees, and so those \u2013 some of those people will be coming down off \u2013 will be coming off the payroll. We've got a significant reorganization that's taking place in Angola. And frankly, as we've gone through our business units and gone through our portfolio, we have found ways to make our organization simpler. I don't know any other way to say it. And so we'll be seeing reductions in a lot of different places. Some of them have already happened, in the Marcellus in the North Sea and in our home offices. So we've season those kinds of reductions. There is some portfolio work that I would \u2013 some of it I would classify as normal as assets mature. You saw the \u2013 for example, we sold our Netherland operations. Our view was that the Chad business was sort of on that \u2013 a lot of the value had already been extracted, so we sold out of that business. So there are assets that get mature where another operator \u2013 as you know well, there are smaller companies or others that want to grind out that last little bit of value that may take on opportunities that won't fit in our portfolio. And so sometimes there's a good match for them, and we'll sell those. Those can result in reduced employees, and I expect it will. But I would classify that as a normal part of our business. These reductions don't include any huge \u2013 the reductions that were forecasted don't include a major portion of the divestitures. The divestiture portion, at this point, is looked at as maybe 10% of that employee reduction, and I would classify it as more routine activity. Doug Leggate : Thank you, John. John S. Watson: Thanks very much, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Hey. Good morning, everybody. We've covered a lot of ground today, so thank you. John, I know other than matching the cash flows, improving upon project execution is a key focus for you and Chevron. Positive advances in the quarter. Can you discuss the changes you have made here and your confidence that execution will improve as you move through this key execution phase? John S. Watson: Yeah, you're right. We are focused on that. You know, Jay Johnson went through some of those in a little bit of detail, and Jay, of course, is really good on projects. And I guess I would say there are a couple of things that I would highlight. I mentioned Angola LNG earlier, and that is symptomatic of something that's hit the industry, I think, overall, and that is engineering and engineering maturity. So we simply have to \u2013 in order to have better \u2013 a better understanding of what we're going to build, we have to advance engineering further. So understanding pipe diameter and things down to a more granular level so that we know what materials we're going to need and we can do better cost estimates is, I would say, number one. You know, the example we've given is the Tengiz project, which is a big one that we'll move forward with here. But that one \u2013 we're over \u2013 we're 35% done with the engineering now, and we'll be somewhere close to 50% by the time we take final investment decisions. So that's number one. But once you complete the engineering, you also have to do more reviews of that engineering, and, I would say, at a higher level, taking a look at constructability of facilities so that you don't \u2013 so that you're sure what you build really is what you want. I'll give you an example. One of the changes we're making in Angola LNG is designing more flexibility in the front end of the plant. It's an associated gas project, and so there's greater variability in feed quality. And I think if we had done more work at the front end, perhaps, we would have designed that with more flexibility in mind. So those are the kinds of things that we're going to need to do. We also have to be very cognizant of the contracting work that is \u2013 the kind of contract that you sign and what incentives are in that contract for the contractor. And that will dictate the level of oversight better. We're likely \u2013 for example, we're likely on the Tengiz project to do more in the way of coordinating the activity of subcontractors on that job, ourselves. So all of these things, I think, are going to make us better, not to mention the usual things around quality assurance that the industry have seen and things of that sort. So the answer is, yes, we're working on improving execution. Evan Calio : Great. And my second question Anchor, it looks like great appraisal results. Any comments on reservoir quality, size range or next appraisal steps, and maybe even somewhat related to Doug's question before. I mean, in a down cycle, do you see an advantage in developing these longer cycle assets where you can cement or secure a lower cost structure versus an onshore asset where you benefit faster on cost savings, but you will presumably reflate over time with a higher decline rate? Maybe how do you think about that? John S. Watson: Yeah. We have to \u2013 we just finished the second well, and so we're going to drill \u2013 we're likely to have another appraisal well that we'll drill, but we're sort of assessing those results. It's likely to be a hub scale type development. You recall, we've said previously that hub scale assets are going to be 400 million to 500 million barrel type developments, and so we feel pretty good about this one. We've got more work to do, but we feel good. As far as doing them off-cycle, this one needs more work to do before we can progress it. So there's a cycle time to that. Costs, I don't want to give you the wrong impression, costs have come down. Deepwater rig rates, you can get deepwater rigs a lot less than previously. They have come down. I think the opportunity, if you talk to some of the equipment providers, they would say the industry can do a better job in standardizing to help them drive costs down. I think the tendency is to think we can continue to extract money out of the supply chain just based on working rates down, but we also have to work with them to help them become more efficient in what they do. And finally, some of the big cost reductions are in drilling efficiency, which I noted \u2013 which I noted earlier. So our view \u2013 just to be clear, our view is that hub class developments in that 400 million to 500 million barrel range can be developed at moderate prices that wouldn't be out of line with the kinds of prices you all are thinking about, and that tie-backs in the 100 million to 200 million barrel category can also be economic. But we're going through our plans right now doing exactly what you described in trying to decide which of these to move countercyclically and which are just going have to wait. Evan Calio : Makes sense. Thanks. John S. Watson: Thanks, Evan. Thanks Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, everyone. John S. Watson: Hey, Paul. Paul Sankey : John, a year ago you were guiding to $40 billion of spending in 2017; now you're guiding to $20 billion to $24 billion. Can you break down what compromises that $15 billion? And just a very quick follow-up as well. Can you give us the start date for Tengiz? Thank you. John S. Watson: Yeah, but, you're saying a year ago. If you're saying before oil prices dropped, yeah, we were guiding to a higher level of spend because we've got a good queue of projects, and that would be the opportunity set that we would contemplate (50:27). Paul Sankey : Yeah, I guess what I wanted to know is what projects, how much of it is cost saving, how much of it is deferred projects? Which projects have been deferred? The specifics of where we got the $15 billion to $20 billion of savings from. Thank you. John S. Watson: Oh, it's across the board. I mean, there are some specific projects. An example, yeah, we've talked about the Rosebank project. We've talked about the Indonesia Deepwater development project. Both of those are not in these forecasts in terms of significant spend during the planned period. I think both projects will ultimately go. Kitimat was on our list. We're pacing that project as well. Multiple Angola projects were in pre-feed, so there were a lot of projects. Bear in mind, some of these projects we think will go, and it could be that they start in the third year of the plan. But for now, a lot of these have come out, and we're going to pace them. Paul Sankey : But I guesstimate that about half of it is cost savings from lower prices, and half is deferred projects. Is that an \u2013 I'm guesstimating. I just wonder. John S. Watson: Yeah, Paul. Look, I don't have a precise number for it. Certainly our view of development costs for the shales have come down significantly during that period, but I don't have a good breakdown for you on that. Sorry. Paul Sankey : Okay, and just the start-up for Tengiz? John S. Watson: Well, it's a function of when we take FID, but we'll give you more details on it. But you can think of it as being into the next decade. Paul Sankey : But just to be clear, I think that you said that the spending in the 2017 number does include some Tengiz spending? John S. Watson: It does. It does. Paul Sankey : Got it. John S. Watson: I mean, we've been doing work to get the port ready. We've been doing work on site infrastructure. I mean, one of the lessons learned on these big capital projects is that you need to take care of some of these certainly long leads in certain cases and site infrastructure and preparation work. So we're spending some money as part of the feed work that we're doing to get greater certainty on costs. But this is a five-plus year kind of construction project, so you can think of it as being into the next decade. And we'll give you more detail after we take FID. Paul Sankey : Thank you, sir. John S. Watson: Sure, thank you. Unknown Speaker : Thank, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please. Blake Fernandez : Folks, good morning. Just two quick points of clarity, if I could. For one, I presume that the CapEx numbers you're providing here include equity affiliate spend. I think historically that's trended around $4 billion and has been self-funding. I'm just trying to see if, for one, making sure that, that is in there, and is that a fair estimate in those numbers? And then, secondly, U.S. natural gas has been ramping up pretty healthy as far as production is concerned. John, you mentioned a low breakeven on Marcellus. I just wanted to confirm, is that the main driver of that? Thanks a bunch. John S. Watson: Yeah. The answer is yes. It's $4 billion to $5 billion in equity and affiliate spend. Remember, as we ramp up the Tengiz project, we've got the CPChem project. We've got some significant spending that's taking place in affiliates. And your second question on Marcellus, we're not shutting down activity completely there. Don't get me wrong. But we're not going to be running six to eight rigs or anything like that in these kinds of conditions. Right now we've just a couple of rigs that are running there. Blake Fernandez : Okay. And John, if I could confirm this. Equity affiliates, that should remain self-funding, is that correct? John S. Watson: Not necessarily. I mean, in general the answer is yes. It's depending on where prices are. I mean, it depends on circumstances. Because as the Tengiz project ramps up, there is significant spend. And there are loan provisions that are being worked as a part of that project, some of which will be equity partners' loans. Blake Fernandez : Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow up a little bit on some of your commentary around the longer cycle project spend. The deferrals that we've seen, I mean, I guess it comes from a combination of things, which is either lower levels of operating cash flow as well as kind of an effort to drive down project costs and improve economics. As you think going forward of where you are right now, I mean, your effort to continue to defer at this point, is it driven primarily by this point by your outlook on cash flows, or do you think that there's still a meaningful amount of either cost deflation on the projects, or, I guess, strategic engineering improvements on your end that have to happen? If cash flow is sure to improve, do you feel like you're at a point where the industry will be able to start to re-invest in those, or is there still gains to be made? John S. Watson: It's a fair question. I would say a lot of it is cash flow driven right now. We're still in the final throes of our revisions to the Tengiz project cost estimates, but we have a pretty good idea where that's going to land. And we have a pretty good idea of the sort of the glide path on technology and where costs are going to go for deepwater projects. But there is some uncertainty on price, and, look, I know my shareholders value our dividend. I know our shareholders value increases in the dividend. And I know they value us investing in high-return projects, and so there is some uncertainty on price. And we want to be sure that \u2013 we've kept our balance sheet in good condition, and we want to be sure we just strike that right balance to continue to pay and grow the dividend and invest in good projects. So we're just working through the cycle and kind of living within our means while we take cost down. One of the things that happens if you're taking on fewer projects is the organization will focus harder on getting more efficient at what they do. And we need to do that. We've got a very good U.S. upstream business, but we didn't make any money in this quarter. And so, we need to get more efficient at what we do, we need to look at our structures and we need to get our costs down. And in the meantime, we're going to be ready for some of the projects that I talked about earlier to move them forward. We'll have some countercyclical investment, but we do need to live within our means. Ryan Todd : Thanks. So then maybe if I could just get your quick thoughts on maybe on global gas demand, Asian gas demand, maybe even more in particular and whether probably less is a relation to Gorgon and Wheatstone, as those are contracted to a large extent. But has there been any shift in your view on global gas demand or Asian gas demand longer term? And how would that affect potentially your longer term view on incremental LNG projects going forward? John S. Watson: Yeah. That's a fair question. I think overall, demand is set to grow very rapidly. And I think the conventional wisdom has been that you're just going to see natural gas displacing coal and gas demand just growing at very rapid rates. Gas has to be competitive with other options in the portfolio for these developing countries. Affordability is very much key, and so while we see literally a doubling of LNG consumption if you go out 10 years versus now, very significant growth in demand, I don't think that's changed. What has changed is the supply picture. We have seen a number of projects take FID and a number of projects are under construction, and the world economy isn't growing quite as fast as we might have thought a few years ago. It's still growing, but it isn't growing quite as rapidly as a few years ago. And so it's a well-supplied market right now. There still are contracting opportunities out there. Customers do value security of supply. They do value having a known source of supply. Not everybody wants to run their economy on spot gas. And so I think there are a number of buyers that want to firm up supply. For example, we signed a medium-term contract earlier this year, and we think there are other opportunities to do that. And as you see slowdown in FIDs on this, I think you'll see consuming countries take stock of that and start to think about additional commitments more toward \u2013 that would be more geared toward supply in the early to middle part of the next decade. Ryan Todd : Thanks, John. I appreciate it. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Ryan. John S. Watson: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read: Yeah, thank you, and good morning. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Roger D. Read: I guess I'd like to kind of get a little more into some of the impacts of potential production declines from \u2013 that you've mentioned from the equity spending at Tengiz, but think about spending on non-operated projects that you're on or non-operating legacy production, and how that may impact the sort of revised production guidance we should think about, or even as a challenge in the 18 and beyond world. John S. Watson: I'm not \u2013 what \u2013 is there a special non-op question or concern? Roger D. Read: No, not a specific one, but let's just think about anywhere where you're not necessarily making the decision, right. You're dependent on someone else for that. How do you maybe take that into account in your forecast as a risk factor? John S. Watson: Well, certainly we're in dialogue with operators. For example, Total is operator in some of the West Africa projects that are potentially in the portfolio. We're an operator of some, and they're an operator of some. And so the dialogue has been pretty good. I would say the biggest area where we can get influenced, frankly, is in the Permian where we've got some smaller companies and they're very good at what they do, but their budgets can move around a little bit. But that's nothing that we can't deal with and accommodate. But I would \u2013 I don't think that's going to determine our flexibility in our capital budget. Roger D. Read: Well, I wasn't thinking so much of capital budget as I was just - you mentioned earlier the underlying production decline kind of being close to 1% in your outlook. You're thinking maybe more of the 2% to 3%, and I'm just kind of wondering what would push you to the 3% or potentially beyond the 3% being these things that are not necessarily in your full control. John S. Watson: Well, it's \u2013 I'm not going to push the 2% to \u2013 I'm not going to say the change of 1% to 3% is a function of non-op decisions, because I think everyone in the industry is doing similar things now. We've been reasonably well aligned on budgets with our partners, whether we're the operator talking to them or they're the operator talking to us. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Roger. Roger D. Read: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next - John S. Watson: We've got time for one more. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI Group. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. John S. Watson: Good morning. Unknown Speaker : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : John, your new capital management plan appears to be one of the more direct steps towards better capital allocation outcomes that we've seen announced thus far in a super major category on these calls. And on this point, I wanted to see if you'd elaborate a little bit on the drivers of the proposed changes. Meaning, a few minutes ago, you talked about how the cyclical element, which is in response to lower oil prices and the need for cash flow to cover the dividend at some point was part it. But also, is there an element of the new plan which relates to the more challenging, competitive condition that appeared to have been a factor for the longer term industry returns in recent years? So the question's really, what's driving the more disciplined approach to investment at Chevron internally when you guys put this together? Meaning, is it cyclical, is it secular, is it both? Could you just spend a minute on that? John S. Watson: Yeah. Truthfully, I would say that there's an element of all the things that you described. I think in general we were heading through a period where we had a disproportionate amount of our spend in big, long cycle projects. So we were going to head to a period where we were going to be digesting those projects and then we would supplement those with a more ratable number of long cycle projects, but then continue to invest in that new base of assets that we've acquired. And so I think that pattern is playing out. I think the issue is what can we do to enhance returns? We've said before, we took down our price deck a little bit from where we were before. And so there is a new reality in that sense, and whether that's due to industry supply conditions or the U.S. dollar or a lot of other factors that have taken commodities down, there is a new reality, if you will, in the commodity price environment for both oil and gas that we're seeing. The industry has been fabulously successful in providing supply. A lot of it is through shale, but also elsewhere. So our focus going forward directionally is consistent with what we would have done anyway. But we've taken spend down, as I commented earlier, to help us really focus on getting the most out of the assets that we have and taking costs down so that we can improve returns. It's unacceptable for us to not be able to make money at whatever commodity price the market is giving us. And that's where we are. Now, I do think commodity prices will improve, and I've said that, but we need to improve our returns. And so, I think that's the focus. And as I commented earlier, if you push the organization in that direction \u2013 I mean, we're already seeing \u2013 I mean, it's hard to put together a business plan right now because the organization is achieving good things in terms of getting our costs down, and it's hard to be forward-looking to know exactly where all the efficiencies might come from as the organization gets more focused on making the best of the assets that they have. So maybe that's the way I can describe it. So it's all of the above including taking costs out of bigger projects going forward. Doug Terreson : Thanks, John. John S. Watson: Okay, so. Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in the company. Jonathan, back to you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead. John S. Watson: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Frank Mount, the General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. Turning to slide three, today we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details, but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. In 2015 we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015. The downstream business produced strong financial performance underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a five-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%. Despite the strong operating results, an oversupplied market led to prices fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low-price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend, both operating expense and capital, to levels consistent with current conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this. Pat will now take you through our financial results. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thanks John. I will be presenting three slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with a tabulation of special items are available in the appendix section of the presentation on our website. Turning now to slide four, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion, or $5.6 billion excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5% and our debt ratio at year end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases. Turning to slide five, cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our two year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion and at year end our net debt stood at $27 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%. Slide six compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 results. Special items such as asset impairments, project suspensions and other charges, along with lower gains on asset sales, reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $14.6 billion between periods, as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower tax items. I'd like to now turn it back to John. John S. Watson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, we are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramped down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and repace investments and by challenging supply chain costs. Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiatives to rationalize head count and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining cost in growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost saving projects are implemented. Turn to slide eight. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. In December we announced a 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital program allows discretion in our spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase and we expect further reductions in our capital program. Turning to slide nine. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio work. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions have captured good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and 2017 we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments. Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value. Turning to slide 10. In 2015 we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects including Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh, along with shale and tight production growth of approximately 30% contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting the increases was the effect of a shut-in of the Partitioned Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%. For 2016, our production guidance is a range of flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestments. To clarify, production from the Partitioned Zone remains shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contributions from major capitals project startups and ramp ups will be significant in 2016 and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty in exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value-driven on all sales. Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels, which in turn will result in somewhat higher base decline rates. Turning to slide 11, our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflects strong well performance results and new geologic data in these plays. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit sharing and variable royalty contracts. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%. Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turning to slide 12, at Gorgon system commissioning from train 1 is in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and system cooling under way. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We'll be ramping up train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for a train 1 startup will come from Io-Jansz wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. On trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site and construction is progressing. Lessons learned from train 1 are being applied and key milestones are being achieved on schedule, with startups expected at approximately six-month intervals after train 1. Turning to Wheatstone on slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunkline is ready for service, and final tie-in work is ongoing. Six of nine wells are drilled and completed offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty are complete, and tank hydro testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be mid-year 2017. Train 2 module deliveries are underway and on track. Turning to slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. On the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. What I would like to talk about is other projects that we have that are also contributing to our performance. If you look at the chart on page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter. Chuandongbei, the first train on Chuandongbei, has come online. And here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is under way. We expect to introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Bangka in Indonesia, and Alder in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected startup later in the year. I mentioned that price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. If you look at slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by WoodMac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. Consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wild card, or uncertainty if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remained much more resilient in 2015 than most predicted. With the significant contraction in global investment caused by low prices, the world would see supplies drop off. WoodMac shows that occurring this year, thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue. Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility in our spend, Chevron will be advantaged relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and prices begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Phil M. Gresh: Hey, good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. John S. Watson: Good morning, Phil. Phil M. Gresh: Thanks for all the color today. The dividend coverage priority is obviously key and very clear. On the third quarter call, you built us a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable in the $50 or so environment and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So I guess what I was wondering is looking out to 2017, if we're sub $50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx you really don't want to go below? John S. Watson: Well, our flexibility continues to grow, and Phil, we're obviously working that number very closely. The level of spend, if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp down from major capital projects. So for example, this year we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously finishing Angola LNG, and then as we wind down Gorgon and have a little more to spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you gain $4 billion right there, and then our flexibility grows as time goes by. We obviously have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have. And it obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction. We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area, because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority is to pay and grow the dividend, and in order to do that, obviously you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first two priorities that we have consistent with good economics on the spending. We've indicated that we're in a long-cycle business. And in such a long-cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long-cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertised that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that's really indicative of needing to have a strong balance sheet. But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs in the business, and right now we're in the downs with prices low. And so we'll use our balance sheet this year, almost regardless of where prices are during the year, and we're going to cut costs. We're going to reduce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We've talked to the rating agencies. They see our internal forecasts around our business. They see more than you do, in other words. And so we'll be very clear where our priorities are and where the flexibility is. And then they have to do their job. But we think that we'll retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand these ups and downs. Phil M. Gresh: Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And then just on the projects, I appreciate all the updates there. Maybe you could just let us know where you stand on the FID for Tengiz, and given what you've been saying about the macro environment and how long it's going to last, where does that stand today? John S. Watson: Yeah, well as you know Phil, it's a good question. Tengiz as you know has been a very good business for us in Kazakhstan. We and our partners have had very good relationships there, and we've had a lot of success, financial and otherwise. And the next phase of opportunity there is the wellhead pressure management project and the future growth project. And we've been working this for some time. And we consciously delayed FID when prices came down. We consciously delayed FID so that we could get additional definition around the project, get greater certainty around what the costs would be. And frankly to drive costs down, given the opportunity that is present given conditions in the industry, and we've had some success with that. But we're not at the point where we're ready to take FID today. With low prices that we're seeing, we're working closely with our partners to ensure that we have adequate funding for the project and to further take costs down. We have been pacing investment. We've been doing critical infrastructure work, but we're still working this project to get it in condition for FID. So I think you'll see us continue to pace investments and we'll keep you updated when we can. We do think these projects are good. We do think that they will go forward. But we're continuing to work it to drive costs down and get alignment on financing. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil, appreciate it. Phil M. Gresh: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please. Paul Y. Cheng: Hey guys, good morning. John S. Watson: Good morning, Paul. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng: John, two questions if I may. For 2016 you give a range of $25 billion at the low end and you indicate that given the market condition, you'll most likely to go down to $25 billion. If you really have to, are there are any additional area that you would be willing to cut and drive it down further? And what that area and by how much, or that this is really the minimum that you can go, given the major project spending? The second question if I could is a quick one : We understand that you have one of the strongest balance sheets, but the credit agencies are also becoming increasingly hostile to the energy sector and looks like they may have a sector downgrade anyway. So what may be the minimum credit rating that is acceptable by the company? John S. Watson: Okay. Well in terms of flexibility, when it comes to capital program, we've given you that range for a good reason. As I indicated, we've got some committed spend that's likely to go forward regardless of the price environment, and really it pertains to the big LNG projects and the projects that are under construction. So we're going to continue to work spend down. And there's always a little bit more flexibility. There's the uncertainty of exchange rates and things of that sort. But I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the $26.6 billion that's in our budget and below the range that we've talked about, because I don't want to shut in all rigs around the world, for example. There are obviously are things you could do that I don't think are the proper things to do, given our expectations going forward. For example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our costs down and we want to keep that momentum going. So we have six operated rigs. There are 14 non-operated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting costs down. And obviously at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supplies are going to be needed and we want to continue the activity that we have there. Need to continue to drive down costs, but want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside the range. Maybe I'll let \u2013 I offered some comments on sort of the philosophy, but maybe I'll let Pat talk a little bit about interaction with the rating agencies and her view on what sort of minimum requirements might be. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so as John said, the rating agencies need to do what the rating agencies need to do and they have conservative oil price scenarios out there and I think that's understandable. If you were in their position, you would be doing the same thing. And I think it's perfectly reasonable to think Chevron, along with everybody in the industry in this particular price environment, would be up for review. They've indicated that many of the companies are up for a review. I'm certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering goes through. So if a downgrade does occur, and I think they're moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be the only one that that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing. And in terms of a minimum, I guess I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet, even if there were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flows. And I think that is the profile that we put forward to the rating agencies. John S. Watson: I'll just say, you asked about flexibility on CapEx for 2016. I don't want to suggest there isn't additional flexibility for 2017 and 2018 because there is, particularly if lower prices persist. But we've given you a range that reflects what we think today, based on the forward look. Obviously if conditions remain where they are today, we'll review those numbers just as we would all our other operating statistics. Paul Y. Cheng: Thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. John S. Watson: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please. Jason D. Gammel: Thank you, and hi everyone. I just wanted to ask about, as you're reviewing potential capital expenditure reductions, how the deepwater program actually fits into this discussion. Because I note a string of successes in both exploration and appraisal that's occurring in the deepwater right now. So how do you think about that drilling program? And then secondly within the deepwater, how do you see that competing over the medium term? Do you still see that as being within the cost curve based upon your own projections of where oil prices could go? John S. Watson: Yeah, Jason, it's a great question and it's one of the areas that I think we and others in the industry are looking at very closely. And I guess if I can take just a second to sort of to back up a little bit. If you look at the macro environment on where supplies are going to come from to meet any demand estimate that might be out there, the world's going to need deepwater oil. It is a significant resource, and over time those barrels are going to be needed. Now, right now the costs in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have onshore. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our analyst meeting that we felt it would take larger accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful, so the precise numbers are being worked. But you're going to need bigger accumulations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure. And then tiebacks similarly will need somewhat higher prices. We have some special charges in the fourth quarter, and $0.5 billion was writing off Buckskin and Moccasin. And that's a project that we thought would go forward. First, we thought it might have the potential to be a hub, and then we thought it had the potential to be a tieback. And I won't say that that project couldn't have gone forward and that it wouldn't meet minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we've got better places to put our money. And so we made the very difficult decision to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it was going to require a couple billion dollars of investments over the next few years. And we just felt over the next few years, we're going to have better places to put our money, notably the Permian. So there are tough choices being made. Now, we have a good position in the deepwater. We've been as successful as anyone there. And we have been successful in driving costs down. We've seen I mean really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in 2015 versus 2014. So our experience in the lower tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding it and driving costs down. We're encouraged by what we've got at Anchor. We've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development with a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of partners in the industry to try to create a hub class development. But this is a work in progress for us to make sure we can have a resource cost balance to make these projects attractive to meet our thresholds. I'm confident we'll be able to do that. It's just we were pushed with Buckskin and Moccasin, and you're seeing others make similar choices if it doesn't quite fit relative to their alternatives. Jason D. Gammel: Appreciate those thoughts, John. If I could ask a real quick follow-up. The $1.1 billion write-down that you had in the upstream, are you able to provide any split between exploration and depreciation on that? John S. Watson: Why don't I let Pat give you a little bit of color on some of those. Because you're right, it's important to know which. It does hit multiple lines on the income statement, and you saw that those numbers were up a little bit. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so I would just say for the full year, if you look at the income statement, the X, the special items that are categorized under exploration expense would be about $1.1 billion. And if you look at the full year for DD&A off the income statement, the special items amount to about $3.5 billion. Jason D. Gammel: That's great. Thanks very much, folks. John S. Watson: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Good morning. I think you're going to get 17 different questions on the same theme, but just you talked about $20 billion, $24 billion of CapEx in 2017 and 2018, and I think on the last call you mentioned sort of a slower rate of growth, 1% to 1.5%. Obviously that rate of growth would also help project execution and hopefully costs will come down. If you were to go down to a lower number of terminal sort of CapEx for a period, maybe just talk a bit about the growth implications beyond 2017. How would it affect the growth rate? And then I have a follow-on. John S. Watson: Yeah, I'm not sure I'll be answer to that fully here. I think we'll probably give you, we will give you a more complete answer when we get to March where we have a chance to run through it. But I would just say, if you look at growth not just through 2017, but through 2018, we feel pretty good about it. And that's largely a function of the projects we have in flight. In 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in 2017. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come on during that period, projects like Hebron in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that period, notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017. Now ultimately the cumulative effect of the reductions in capital, if they persist at a low level, will be felt. But I think we'll have a little more resilience than people think. Now, that's other things being equal, depending upon where prices are, depending upon asset sales and things of that sort. But in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production indefinitely, that would be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you previously. We have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the activity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little longer-term outlook in our upcoming meeting in March if that's okay. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And then the follow-on is on the OpEx and SG&A part of that reduction of 13% to 18% from $61 billion down to a lower number. I mean, obviously the market helps give you some OpEx and then there's some structural changes that you've made, some difficult decisions. I mean, should we think that there's another big structural shift that you can make to maybe even outpace the market in terms of OpEx and SG&A reductions, say into 2017? John S. Watson: Well, we're working really hard and we're pulling all levers. Obviously, though, the cost in goods and services in our procurement group is having a fair degree of success. I will say we've had more success in the US than internationally, number one. And so we'll continue to drive that hard. That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies. Just as an example, we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of 2014 to the end of 2015. There are another 4,000 coming this year and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower and we do have a number of projects that we'll be ramping down. Now, we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question we're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. So our desire is to keep moving that. Now, I will say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on new assets, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. There's still some final allocations for what goes in the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure, but it's down over $2 per barrel and I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down. Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream had record performance this year, and as you know they've had restructuring under way for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to reduce costs, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream costs. The corporate center we've obviously looked at and made some significant changes. A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be felt and the ongoing work that I've described in the upstream. So my message is we're driving it hard, but we're trying to be thoughtful so that we keep the talent we need for the long haul in the organization. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Makes sense, thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ed. John S. Watson: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI Group. Your question, please. Doug Terreson : I wanted to get some clarity on the 0% to 4% growth projection and the point that John made a few minutes ago about higher decline rates. And specifically, is it reasonable to assume that we're going to have growth this year from the United States, Africa and Australia and declines elsewhere? Is that the accurate way to think about it? John S. Watson: Africa, Australia, and the United States. Doug Terreson : Yeah. John S. Watson: I think that is a pretty good way to look at it. We tend to look at it by project. But we do have obviously the shale and tight that's growing and ongoing ramp up in the deepwater. Obviously, the projects in Australia and then Angola, and volume from Angola LNG. So I think that's a pretty good characterization of it, yes. Doug Terreson : Okay. Okay. And then also, John, on the neutral zone, there's been some more commentary on progress and so my question is, is the project real to your knowledge? And if it is, if we are seeing progress underway, what period of time could those fields return to full production if in fact there was movement, meaning is this something we should think about in terms of weeks or months or quarters? So just an update there would be appreciated. John S. Watson: I'm sorry, I missed the first part of it, which location? Doug Terreson : Yeah, John, on the neutral zone there's been some commentary. John S. Watson: Sorry. Yeah, in the Partitioned Zone, look, I gave you guys a long explanation last quarter. The fields, they're still shut in and there have been ongoing dialogue between the Saudis and the Kuwaitis. And as I described before, there's plenty of incentive to bring those fields back online and I probably have to leave it there. Doug Terreson : Okay. John S. Watson: What I'll tell you, implicit in our assumption is about, is a mid-year startup. The middle of that range includes a mid-year startup, but remember 2014 production was about 80,000 barrels a day. When you start up mid year, you don't start up at 80,000, you start out at something lower than that because the facilities have been mothballed and preserved for a period of time. So that's what's reflected. To the extent that agreement is reached, and there have been discussions, to the extent agreement is reached and it's started up sooner, it'll be to the higher end of that range and to the extent that it continues, the bottom of the range is zero if they don't start up at all this year. Doug Terreson : Okay, fair enough, John. Thanks a lot. John S. Watson: Sure. Frank Mount : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thanks, good morning everybody. Frank Mount : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : John, I know I've kind of tried this one before, but in light of the further collapse in oil prices, I wanted to ask again about growth versus growth per share. And what's really behind my question is whether investing in a highly uncertain environment in what I'm guessing are potentially sub-economic assets, is it an argument just for outright deferral and outright declines that can be picked up again through share buybacks, if indeed oil prices did recover absent any major capital commitments? I'm just wondering philosophically how you think about that, given the potential risk to your credit rating that we stand right now. John S. Watson: No Doug, actually I think it's a fair question. I mean the message I've been trying to convey is that we are dramatically cutting investment going forward. We all have to make estimates of what oil and gas prices will be going forward, but in terms of longer-cycle projects, we aren't initiating any. As I've described, we've got some momentum in the system from projects under construction, but we are, you are going to see us preferentially favor short-cycle investments. And if they don't meet our hurdles, we won't invest. Taken to the extreme, we're not just going to invest to hold volume. We're going to invest where we think we can get good returns. And so we've repurchased shares in the past and we'll do that again. We won't fund opportunities that we don't think will be effective for the company. And you and I can both put some hindsight on some of the things that we and others in the industry have put money in right now, but we're tightly scrutinizing what we're spending right now. And I hope I can make that really clear to you. I mean, that's indicative of the kinds of choices we made with Buckskin Moccasin. It's indicative of the kind of changes we've made with a big development in the North Sea. That's the direction that we're going, again trying to balance our expectations for the forward curve. Doug Leggate : I appreciate your answer, John. I know it's not fun for anyone right now. My follow-up is really, I don't know who wants to take this, but it's on the asset sales. There seems to be, everybody and their grandmother seems to be looking to sell assets right now. I'm just wondering if you could characterize how you see the depth of the market, and whether or not you think you can still execute on that program. And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John S. Watson: Yeah, no, that's a real good question. In fact, I think your point is spot-on. I think it's a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets out there, particularly obviously oil-related assets. And that's why I've been pretty circumspect around asset sales. We sold $11 billion over the last two years, but we're giving you a $5 billion to $10 billion for the next two years in the numbers that I've given you. And from a strategic point of view, there's some opportunities out there that I think will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them. If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example over the last two years, there was a lot of strength in the infrastructure market selling pipelines, for example. And on strategy grounds and on valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investments in the pipeline business to those that are critical to our upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those. Things like Caltex Australia, we thought values were very strong and assets had \u2013 we'd been very well aligned with them, but they were heading off potentially in a growth direction. And we felt that from our strategic point of view that it'd be best to exit when we did. So we've been very careful. And I can tell you the assets going forward, we don't advertise them, but if you look at the ones where there's information in the public domain, I think you'll see that those are assets where there are potential buyers out there at good value. So I think your admonition is a very good one, and it's why we haven't put big numbers out there. Doug Leggate : Appreciate it. Thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Evan Calio : Hey, good morning, guys. John S. Watson: Good morning. Frank Mount : Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio : Hey, John, you answered the Tengiz question before, yet are there any FIDs that are currently baked into 2016 and your 2017 to 2018 budget ranges? And I guess as it relates to CapEx, I mean how much flexibility is there to open or reprice contracts within projects post-FID? It appears to be there's more flexibility than at least what we had perceived? John S. Watson: Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously for any project we had in flight, we went back to all the project teams and created an expectation that they will look to try to capture cost reductions. In some cases where you've bid contracts and the terms and conditions are fixed, you are where you are. But on anything where you have not taken FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we've delayed our costs. I mean, part of the recycle of the projects is to see if there's a different development scheme and things like that. For example, Rosebank has a different development scheme. But part of it is also to be sure you can capture the cost reductions that are available, that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes you have to just say we're not going to do this if we don't get better costs, and that tends to focus partners and others. So we expect to see declining breakevens as a result of those initiatives, both to reframe projects in some cases, or to try to drive costs out. In terms of what we've got actually planned, most of the effort, most of the things that we would call FIDs are really things like infill drilling. So for example, the next phase of drilling at Agbami, the next phase of drilling at Jack/St. Malo, which are utilizing existing rigs and drilling off of existing to support existing infrastructure. In terms of big new greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price/cost balance I've been talking about. And that's why I say we have significant flexibility going forward as we complete things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Mafumeira Sul, Angola LNG and others. Evan Calio : Great, so it sounds like they're not currently in the budget. Let me just add a follow-up question or a smaller item. Are the startup volumes at Gorgon, are they at spot or contract pricing, and can you give us any color or update on the spot LNG market and whether you see an ability to term up any incremental uncontracted Gorgon volumes? And I'll leave it at that. John S. Watson: Yeah, in general the sales will be under contract. In fact, you've probably seen recently we have signed a couple of additional HOAs. We said all along that we thought that it's appropriate to have about 85% under long-term contract for Gorgon and Wheatstone. And with those HOAs, assuming those turn into SBAs, we'll be over 80%. So we feel pretty good about that. And those are medium-term type contracts that we've put in place. So we feel good about it. But during the ramp up, we've got contracts that are available for these volumes. Now as far as the overall LNG market, it's lousy. When you look at spot cargos and prices, and I expect we're going to go through a challenging, as an industry, we're going to go through a challenging period for any volumes that will be sold spot into the marketplace. Evan Calio : Appreciate it. John S. Watson: Thanks, Evan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Question, maybe you've talked kind of indirectly a bit about your view towards the short cycle on the US onshore in the near term, and I appreciate some of that color. But can you talk about trends and activity levels and volumes, in particularly in the Permian? And I guess just in a broader sense how you look to manage the short cycle spend over the near to medium term. I mean it sounds like it's clearly taking preference over long-cycle spend, but what's dictating the difference between spending $3 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion and so on? How do you manage that over the medium term? John S. Watson: Yeah, it's a fair question. I mean the short answer is there's some judgment that we're applying. We have been on a pathway in the Permian of first assessing what we have. So we've been drilling both vertical and horizontal wells. Over the last year, we've really converted our entire program to horizontal wells, and really getting, an overused term, but getting our factory model in place. And we've done that. And our costs are now very competitive with some of the best in the business. So that is taking place and we want to continue that effort. Our view is not that prices are going to stay at the low range they are today. But part of living within your means is limiting just how many rigs you deploy. We've got six operated rigs today. We got 14 in our JV rigs that are operating today, and we think that's about the right balance. We have flexibility to move up. And what I've told our people, if they stay on the cost trajectory that they are, we're going to look to fund them. The economics in some of the best areas at strip type prices work. They're not as good as we'd like at higher prices, but they work. And so that obviously is guiding us, but I would hate to lose the momentum that we have in the Permian with some of the cost reduction efforts we have under way. We've told you, we got 3,000 locations that we think meet economic threshold at $50. So obviously, prices aren't $50 today, but it's indicative of the strength of the portfolio that we have. Ryan Todd : Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one kind of step-back question. We spend a lot of time these days talking about how rough everything is and all the costs that are having to be cut. But maybe if you tick around and just look at the other side, can you address any positives or opportunities that you're seeing? I mean, a resetting of the cost structure is clearly one, but anything that you're seeing emerge as you look towards your position in your business for the next cycle, some of the positive things whether it's resource capture or fiscal terms, or any other opportunities that are kind of a silver lining of what we're seeing right now? John S. Watson: Well, thank you for a silver lining question. We're looking for those internally too. You're right, it is very tough times. A couple thoughts that I'll give you. One, I think the cost reductions we're going after, most of them will be permanent. For example, the efficiencies that we've gained in our drilling, those are permanent regardless of what happens to rig rates going forward, so whether it's a deepwater that I talked about earlier or onshore. So that's number one. Number two, I think the benefits that we're taking on in some of our organizations and some of our structures, I think a lot of that will be permanent, and I think we've undervalued what simplicity in org structures can provide. So obviously we're taking out some layers. We've got rolling reorganizations that are being implemented around the world, and I think that simplicity and clarity will be a positive for the business. In terms of resource capture, there are better opportunities today than there might have been a year ago. And the balance between what I'll say the expectations and value of resources getting better aligned. So there are opportunities emerging. I mean, our priority is obviously the things I've been talking about this morning. But we are in a resource business and you do want to be attentive to the opportunities that are out there. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Neil Singhvi Mehta : Hey, good morning. John S. Watson: Good morning. Neil Singhvi Mehta : John, you made the comment that non-OPEC supply has been relatively resilient over the course of the year. You also made the point that the base decline rates was less than 2% in your portfolio over the course of this year. How does that compare relative to history? And as you look at 2016, how do you think your base decline rate looks like towards the midpoint of guidance? John S. Watson: In general, I mean the two are somewhat related. Our base decline has been good because we've operated very reliably and we've actually gotten quite efficient in our business. So we have been able to mitigate the declines. We've also flagged though, that with the lower level of spending on base business, infill drilling in places like Bakersfield and elsewhere, you are going to see declines slightly higher. And so that's why we've suggested that, and we do expect to see that across the industry. The history has shown during downturns like this, you can see an increase of 1% or 2% industry-wide in that base decline, so that is, I think that's clear. In terms of the resiliency that we've seen in production, it's partly related to that. But to me it's been, if you look at 2015, the impact of projects that were in flight has probably been more than we as an industry anticipated. So we're not the only ones with Jack/St. Malos and Bibiyanas and other projects that are under construction that are coming up. Secondly of course, you've had the impact of hedges in the unconventional business, and the brief uptick that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow some additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity. But increasingly, all that's wearing off as all the projects come online, as base business declines start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes. The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on host governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments living within their means is social, the choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that's been given by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. So I think the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things into balance. You still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously Iran is bringing volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable. Frank Mount : Thanks, Neil. Neil Singhvi Mehta : Thanks, Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning, everybody. John, you've part answered this question. My original question was going back to the volumes. It looks like quite a big percentage range, but in barrels a day it's only about 100,000 barrels a day for 2016, that's to say the 0% to 4% range of uncertainty. You part answered the question because you addressed the partitioned neutral zone. Can you talk a bit about the variances in the other elements, so how much volume potentially variances there in the startups, the divestments, the price effects and the spend levels? Because it feels like that 100,000 variance actually is not that wide. It seems big in percentage but not so much volume. Thanks. John S. Watson: Yeah, that's a very good observation. The range is wide. And you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. Paul Sankey : Thanks. John S. Watson: Just if you look at the difference between $30 and $60 per barrel, just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves aren't all linear in different locations around the world, so there is considerable variability from price alone. If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the three trains at Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day, and we've said that we expect production to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. There are industry averages around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. To the extent you're at the high end of that range where you have a smooth startup, we have the well capacity, so you could have a very rapid ramp-up. Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you encounter something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter and to have cargos in the second quarter, but there's variability around that in the ramp-up. And so all of those \u2013 and by the way, there's a second train at Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then there's just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low $30s, we're going to drop rigs as the price moves on. And the last piece, and it's one that I won't provide much in the way of specifics, is really divestments. Because we've indicated for example that our shallow water, our shelf activities that we have packages for sale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. And then there's some other potential assets in the upstream that are under consideration, but it really depends on getting value and the timing of those. And so that is why you get a range. And you are correct, the range can be broader than indicated there. But I felt if I gave you any broader range, you'd say this wasn't very helpful. Paul Sankey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alistair Syme from Citi. Your question, please. Alastair R. Syme: Thanks very much. John, can I just come back to your comment on the divestment market. You said it's a terrible market for selling assets, therefore I guess it must be a great market for buying. Appreciate the balance sheet constraints, but what leads you away from temptation? John S. Watson: What leads me away from temptation. Well just, I know you've heard me over the years, but if I just to ground everyone that's on the phone, we've said over many years that we're in the resource business. It's declining, and we'll replace resource through a combination of exploration, discovered resource participation and acquisitions. And Chevron has done that over time. Our growth position has been pretty good, and so M&A hasn't been a particular priority for us. But we are mindful of the opportunities that are out there. I wouldn't want you to think our focus is anything other than getting the projects we have under construction, and completing the work we have and ramping up the assets that we have, because I think we've got a pretty nice business profile going forward. But we do need to look at what is out there and we're going to be value driven. But there are opportunities that could present themselves in the current market. So we'll be mindful of that. But remember, we're trying to grow the dividend and invest for the long term here, and so we're not driven, we're not particularly transaction driven in any period of time. I have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Asit Sen from CSLA. Your question, please. Asit Sen : Thanks, good morning. A quick one on shale, if I may, and tight oil. On slide 23 of the presentation, the year-over-year production bridge, shale and tight oil is shown as an impressive 44,000 barrels a day in 2015. What was the split between Permian and Vaca Muerta? And also can we get a full year 2015 shale and tight oil production for Chevron? John S. Watson: The increase, of that 44,000, about two-thirds of it was Permian Wolfcamp, and the rest of it was between Argentina and some of our Appalachia activity. And in terms of what's forward looking, I think I'm going to leave that to the security analyst meeting that we've coming up in March, where we'll give you a little deeper insight into our work in the Permian and kind of the range of ramp-up that we can see there. And we've done that every year, and we'll update you this year based on both the cost improvements that we've seen and then realities of the price market that we're in. Okay. Asit Sen : Thanks, John, and since we have you, one macro question on Iran. And you already talked an Iran ramp-up. And are you involved in any discussion that's been mentioned by your European peers? John S. Watson: Well, I'll answer the second question first, no. We're not able to do that, so we don't. I would just say that we've got our hands pretty well full. We always look at opportunities when it's legal for us to do so around the world, but I don't have any particular insight into Iran. You've seen the range of speculation around their ability to ramp up production. Some have speculated that it's going to be a little harder than advertised, but I don't have any particular insight to offer you. And perhaps others can help you with that. John S. Watson: Okay, I would like to thank all of you for being on the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company and your participation. We look forward to seeing you at our March meeting in New York. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right, thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Joe Geagea, Executive Vice President of Technology, Projects, and Services. Many of you know Joe. But for those of you who don't, I thought it would be useful to highlight that he leads our technology, procurement, and project functions. He also oversees our centers for excellence for upstream, including drilling. Also joining me on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. I'll begin with key messages from our March 2016 security analyst meeting, followed by a recap of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Joe will provide some color around our spend reduction initiatives and discuss recent updates on key projects prior to my concluding remarks. Turning now to slide three, our Analyst Day was about seven weeks ago now, and I thought it would be worthwhile to reiterate the primary messages from that series of sessions. Preserving and growing the dividend is our first priority. Our intention is to be able to cover the dividend in 2017. Our capital spend profile is coming down. We are completing major capital projects already under construction but otherwise reducing long-cycle spend. We are lowering our cost structure to better match a low price environment by improving efficiencies, streamlining the organization, and working with suppliers to achieve cost reductions. At the same time, we expect our cash inflows to be growing. Production increases will occur as we bring on and ramp up projects. While volume growth is sensitive to any number of unknowns, such as prices, divestments, ramp-up profiles, we anticipate volume growth through the end of the decade using reasonable estimates for these and other uncertainties. The cash generation of the new assets coming online is substantial, to the point where these production adds are expected to raise the overall cash margin per barrel of the entire portfolio, even absent any increase in price. This year, we plan to use some of our borrowing capacity to complete projects. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we believe we can come through the lows of this price cycle with long-term financial strength intact. Our investment will shift to a higher proportion of short-cycle projects. Not only are many of these brownfield opportunities, but they will give us greater capital flexibility going forward to help limit further debt increases. Finally, we are focused on improving financial returns, reducing pre-productive capital, moving towards more short-cycle higher-return investments, lowering our cost structure, and improving execution on major capital projects. Turning to slide four, an overview of our financial performance; the company's first quarter loss was $725 million or negative $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, the loss for the quarter totaled $211 million or negative $0.11 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 22%. Our net debt ratio was 18%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4.2%. Turning to slide five, cash generated from operations was $1.1 billion during the first quarter. Obviously, upstream cash generation has been heavily penalized by low commodity prices. Downstream continues to generate strong cash flow, although seasonal patterns are evident. During the quarter, operating cash flow reflected about $1 billion of working capital requirements as well as certain pension contributions. In addition, affiliate dividends were modest in the quarter, a pattern that is clearly price-related. And we expect cash generation to improve going forward as our costs come down and as prices move up. Cash capital expenditures were $5.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 27% from first quarter 2015. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.9 billion, and our net debt position was about $33 billion. Turn to slide six, slide six compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2016 results were $3.3 billion lower than first quarter 2015 results. About half of this quarter-on-quarter decline was in special items and foreign exchange. Overall, special items accounted for a negative variance between quarters of $755 million, the bulk of which related to last year's recognition of both asset sale gains and the favorable impact of changes in UK petroleum tax regulations. A swing in foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $900 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Excluding special items and foreign exchange, upstream earnings decreased approximately $1.6 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating and exploration expenses. The realization change was in line with our sensitivity of $350 million per $1 change in Brent. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by approximately $475 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower corporate tax items. Turning to slide seven, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2016 with the fourth quarter 2015. First quarter results were $137 million lower than fourth quarter. A swing in special items, mainly the absence of fourth quarter's impairment and project suspension charges, increased earnings by $930 million. Foreign exchange impacts went the other way, decreasing earnings by $365 million between periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by approximately $750 million between quarters, primarily reflecting lower realizations, again in line with our sensitivity. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange were lower by $163 million. Weaker refining margins were partially offset by stronger trading results, lower operating expenses, and the absence of year-end inventory charges from a draw into higher-cost prior-year layers. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges. Slide eight compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp-ups, primarily at Gorgon in Australia, Chuandongbei in China, and Lianzi and Moho Nord in West Africa, increased production by 11,000 barrels per day. The absence of planned and unplanned downtime, mainly at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, increased production by 25,000 barrels per day between periods. Shale and tight production declined 5,000 barrels a day between quarters, as external constraints such as weather impacts and downtime at a third-party processing facility impacted the Permian. Price and cost recovery effects associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day between quarters, as lower crude prices were more than offset by the impact from lower spend on cost recovery. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and other adjustments. All this said, first quarter volumes are up about 2% from full-year 2015 production. This is right in the middle of the guidance range we provided in January and reaffirmed in March. We still believe this guidance is appropriate. Slide nine compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 38,000 barrels per day, primarily due to production ramp-ups from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh, and West Africa, in addition to startups at Gorgon in Australia and Chuandongbei in China. Shale and tight production increased by 37,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Permian and Marcellus in the U.S. and the Liard and Duvernay basins in Canada. Volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by 16,000 barrels per day, as the positive impact from lower crude prices was partially offset by the impacts of lower spending on cost recovery. The shut-in of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by approximately 76,000 barrels per day. The decrease of 30,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and higher downtime activity, partially offset by production from new wells and favorable impact from reduced external constraints. Turning now to slide 10, we are making good progress at reducing our spend. These charts use a rolling four-quarter average to illustrate capital and operating expense reductions. When comparing the rolling four-quarter average of first quarter 2016 to the same period of the prior year, capital outlays are down 19%. In December, we announced a C&E program of $26.6 billion for the year. But as we noted in March, we are now targeting closer to $25 billion for the year. As we continue to finish major capital projects under construction, we will move to an absolute lower level of annual spend in future years, as evidenced by our $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you for 2017 to 2018. Affordability considerations at the time will be paramount in determining actual budgets. Capital intensity will be going down. Capital discipline will be going up. You see the same downward pattern on operating expense. Expenses continued to rise through 2014, but then notably turned south in mid-2015, as our deliberate cost savings initiatives began to take hold. The rolling first quarter 2016 average is 6% lower than the comparable figure a year ago. There are some transitional costs such as severance and rig termination fees that are incurred as we take steps to compete more effectively in a lower price environment. Once we're through with the transition costs and as we carry on with the implementation of our various cost savings initiatives, we expect to see continued movement towards a lower sustainable cost structure. Cost reduction momentum should continue through 2016 and 2017, as the full run rate of our actions is recognized. Joe will now walk you through some specific examples of our cost reduction efforts before offering an update on key projects. Joseph C. Geagea: Thank you, Pat. Turning to slide 11, I'll start by providing some examples in support of Pat's analysis. Our efforts have focused on achieving sustainable reductions and improving efficiencies. On the organizational side, to date we have reduced our employee head count by more than 4,000 relative to year end 2014, and we are on target to achieve approximately 8,000 total employee reductions by the end of 2016. We're also on target to reduce our contractor workforce by about 6,500 from 2014 levels. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you examples of our improved drilling efficiencies in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico, so today let me give you an additional example from a different region of the world. In Thailand, operational discipline and streamlined processes have enhanced drilling execution efficiency, resulting in about 45% lower average days per 10,000 feet drilled in a two-year period, as you can see in the graph. And we are continuing to outperform our regional competitors. We're also focused on improving our efficiencies and logistics. One example in West Africa includes shifting from department dedicated vessels to a centrally-managed fleet using a decision support center. As a result of this effort, we expect to achieve savings of 30% and reduce the number of vessels in that region by about 40%. We're also continuing to take advantage of our size and scale. In a different part of the world, we are coordinating contract awards with one supplier across three different regions and reducing the number of vessels by optimizing marine vessel size. One of our focus areas is to retain gains achieved during this industry downturn. We are doing this across the globe. For example, in one region we are taking advantage of the current downturn to negotiate with our main supplier, lock in lower rates through 2022, and upgrade with newer and more capable equipment. It not only improved our rates but is also expected to improve our reliability. As we look ahead in the supply chain, we see opportunities for more strategic supplier relationships and standardization. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you the cost savings achieved in the oil field tubulars category. These reductions were achieved through standardization and supplier rationalization, where we went from having 35 suppliers in the past to four going forward. On Gorgon, we have worked to standardize and intend to replicate subsea equipment, generating procurement and installation efficiencies as well as considerable cost savings. And lastly, we've been working at standardizing the valves for some time, and we will start deploying these standard valves on future projects. Turning to slide 12, let me give you some project updates. At Gorgon, we commenced LNG production on March 7. We ramped up total production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day, and we shipped the first cargo on March 21. Since late March, we have incurred downtime at the plant due to mechanical issues with the propane refrigerant circuit of Train 1. Repairs to this equipment are nearing completion, and we are in the process of reinstating the propane refrigerant circuit. We expect to restart Train 1 in the next few weeks and resume LNG production within the 30 to 60-day estimate we provided previously. We still expect to achieve Train 1 ramp-up within the previous guidance of six to eight months from initial startup. Construction on Train 2 and Train 3 is progressing as planned, and we anticipate these trains being ready for startup at roughly six-month intervals. Turning to slide 13, at Wheatstone, all nine development wells are completed. We expect to release the drilling rig in the next few months following well cleanup activities. Offshore platform hookup and commissioning is progressing on track, with this work expected to be complete well in advance of plant startup. At the plant site, piping, electrical, and instrumentation work is progressing well. Our plan reflects observed performance rates on other Australian LNG projects. Actual rates are currently on track with our plan, and the outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Train 2 construction work is also progressing on schedule. Twelve of 24 process modules required for Train 2 startup are now on site and module deliveries are meeting scheduled milestones. Turning to slide 14, I'd like to share brief updates on the other projects which we are expecting to start up this year. At Angola LNG, gas has been introduced into the plant and the team is working through the startup process, with dehydration ongoing ahead of commencing liquefaction. We expect LNG production imminently and anticipate shipping the next cargo in May. At Mafumeira Sul, hookup and commissioning is ongoing. All structures, topsides, and pipelines are installed and the living quarters platform is now occupied, enabling increased manpower on piping, electrical, and commissioning work. Batch drilling of the first 10 wells is complete and first production is expected later this year. At Chuandongbei, Train 1 started up in January, and we were able to ramp up to full capacity within 30 days. Train 2 came online in early April, and ramp up is in progress. We expect to start Train 3 this quarter. At Alder, topsides have been installed and subsea installation work is progressing. At Bangka, well completions are currently ongoing. First production is expected from both these projects later this year. Pat will now share an update on our asset sales program. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right, thanks Joe. Turning to slide 15, asset sales are a routine part of our business. They generate needed cash and they enable a more strategic, effective, and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next two years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10 billion in sales proceeds. The assets targeted for sale are marketable, and we believe the prospective transactions are executable as well. We generally do not discuss specific assets targeted for sale until we have a transaction. However, there has been growing media coverage since our Analyst Day on a few of these prospective sales, and as such we wanted to provide updates where possible. The chart highlights some specific transactions that are in the public domain. You will note the vast majority of these are not oil price sensitive, and thus we expect to be able to obtain good value on the sales. There were no significant transactions in the first quarter, but activity has picked up in the second quarter. Already known second quarter transactions include the sale of our interest in two gas storage facilities in Western Canada, the sale of our KLM pipeline and Western San Joaquin crude oil pipelines in California, and the divestiture of 19 fields and associated assets located primarily in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Shelf and in Louisiana state waters. In 2015, we signed an agreement to sell our New Zealand downstream operations, subject to certain regulatory approvals. Those regulatory approvals were received yesterday, and we now anticipate final closing midyear. Just last week, we reached an agreement to sell our assets in Hawaii. The sale includes the 58,000 barrel per day refinery, interest in a 58-site branded service station network, four product distribution terminals, pipeline systems, and other downstream-related assets. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half 2016. In addition, we are soliciting interest to sell our 75% shareholding in South Africa downstream. We are also exploring potential interest in our geothermal business and Myanmar upstream assets. In aggregate, while it's always difficult to be precise about specific timing, we currently have line of sight on around $2 billion in proceeds, maybe a little higher, for 2016. And because we have multiple transactions in the queue, including those not highlighted on the slide, we have confidence in achieving our two-year $5 billion to $10 billion target. Turning to slide 16, I'd like to close with another slide from our recent investor sessions. It's an illustration of how we get cash balanced next year. In this slide, we used $52 Brent, as it was the actual average price in 2015 and in line with average sell-side analyst price targets for 2017. However, we are committed to balancing at any reasonable price. Spending will come down significantly this year and next, as major development projects get finished and come online, as we high-grade future investments to shorter-cycle, higher-return opportunities, and as we get more efficient and lower our cost structure. Cash generation will grow, not only because of more production, but also because of accretive cash margins on the new production. We'll continue to streamline the portfolio. In short, we are taking the steps necessary to compete in a lower-price environment. If a lower-price environment persists for longer, we will adjust and pursue even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven. We intend to be a resilient competitor regardless of the price environment. Okay, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we have a lot of folks trying to get questions in, so please limit yourself to one question and perhaps one follow-up if that's necessary. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Neil Mehta : Hey, good morning, guys. Joseph C. Geagea: Good morning, Neil. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Neil. Neil Mehta : So just, Pat, I wanted to start off on dividend growth and just your thoughts on raising the dividend in 2016. Is that still a priority for the company? And then how we should think about timing. Patricia E. Yarrington: Sure, yes. Sustaining and growing the dividend is still the first priority from a cash use standpoint for the corporation. It long has been, and it continues to be. Obviously, our immediate financial environment makes this challenging. We have long said that we'll raise the dividend when our cash flow and our earnings allow it to be sustained. And obviously in first quarter, that was not the circumstances that we found ourselves in, and therefore a deferral was prudent. I think going forward, the timing will obviously be dependent upon future cash, future earnings, what happens to price, what happens to our project ramp-ups, how all that plays out in future quarters. We'll also have to take a look at what we think is happening to commodity prices over a longer sweep of time because, again, we're looking at a dividend as being essentially a commitment in perpetuity. We're very aware of our 28-year record of consecutive annual per share payment increases, and that will be taken into account. So the board will take all this into account as it looks at dividends each and every quarter. Frank Mount : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please. Blake Fernandez : Folks, good morning. When I look at the composition of the upstream earnings, it seems like the U.S. screams kind of lackluster compared to the international component, and to me that's a proxy for short-cycle versus long-cycle. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how you envision the economics there changing as far as short-cycle maybe improving relative to long-cycle longer term. Joseph C. Geagea: Okay, let me start by restating that prices were very low in the first quarter. As Pat mentioned, there were a number of one-time events in the first quarter which adversely impacted our production. Now going forward, we still expect to realize the growth range we provided at our analyst meeting. The key for us is to really exercise the things within our control, and that is to continue to drive costs down and to improve our efficiencies. And we have given several proof points in the past about how much progress we've done in that regard. We're now in full horizontal factory mode in the Permian. We've brought our well cost down by about 40%. And we have about 4,000 well locations that offer us a 10% rate of return at around $50 WTI. And when you add on top of all of that the royalty advantage that we have, we see our activity in the Permian as being very, very strong. So the key for us is to continue to be competitive, and we do that very well because we also have NOJV, so we have a good line of sight on how well other people are operating in the basin, and of course we screen and base our own economics. And lastly, the royalty advantage gives us a tremendous boost here. Frank Mount : Thanks, Blake. Blake Fernandez : Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: I'd just like to add too that as we lower our operating expenses from a corporate standpoint as well as in terms of organizational efficiencies, you're going to continue to see those benefits come through as well. And I talked earlier about some transitional costs, severance costs being one of those that I would highlight, that impacted the U.S. segment in this particular quarter. And as we move through that, you'll obviously have stronger earnings once those are concluded. Joseph C. Geagea: And to support Pat, our costs at the center have gone down by about 20%, and many SBUs in our upstream in particular have gone through tremendous reorganizational changes, and we're going to see the fruit of that over the next few quarters. Blake Fernandez : Got it. Thank you very much. Frank Mount : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Paul Sankey : Hi, Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Paul Sankey : Pat, you provided on slide 16 an illustration of how you can get back to flat with a $52 assumption and an arrow pointing upwards on price recovery. If that arrow was pointing downwards \u2013 and as you mentioned, you had prioritized the dividend and going into further cost savings and further CapEx cuts \u2013 how low could you go on CapEx? Can you give us an idea what the absolute base number is for you guys? Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: I think, Paul, I don't want to go to an absolute base number. We've given you a range of $17 billion to $22 billion. And that range really will \u2013 I think the $17 billion number was low given a representative or reasonable set of price expectations. But frankly, if we find ourselves in a different place, affordability is a paramount consideration here for us, and we will continue to prioritize and high-grade our opportunities. Our primary methodology in terms of capital allocation starts from what do we absolutely need to do to maintain reliability, maintain the asset integrity. And after that, after we have concluded what that is for the operation, then we build up our capital program after that, and we have a great deal of flexibility. So each and every one of those layers of additional spend will have significant hurdles that they have to overcome, and affordability becomes an overriding consideration. So we'll continue to manage the capital down commensurate with the price environment. We'll continue to push forward with our asset sales. I mentioned only $2 billion or so line of sight, maybe a little bit more for this year, but we see our way clear to the $5 billion to $10 billion program. And obviously, for us to have confidence in saying it's $5 billion to $10 billion, we've got more lined up behind that because we know not every transaction will be executed in the timeframe that we've outlined. So we feel confident about our ability to get cash balanced at any reasonable price here. Paul Sankey : Got it. That first number that you gave, what is that number? That's not $17 billion is it? That's the starting point number. That's the number I'm looking for. Patricia E. Yarrington: The $17 billion... Paul Sankey : No, you said you started out with... Patricia E. Yarrington: It was the bottom range that we gave for C&E prospectively for 2017 to 2018. Paul Sankey : But the number that you said you start with is an absolute minimum for integrity. That's the number I'm looking for. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, and we haven't publicized that number. It would be low because it really is just from an asset integrity and asset reliability standpoint. All I can say is the vast majority of our capital program is above that and would give us opportunities for flexibility. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. I appreciate your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, your question, please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Good morning, Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Ed. Frank Mount : Good morning, Ed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) So a key message from the Analyst Day was, obviously, as you get these big projects lined up, a shift to shorter-cycle shale, but also monetize the large brownfield opportunity which you already have behind existing facilities that you built, you should be much more capital intensive. That's a good thing. On the other hand, your debt burden is clearly going to be much higher. It depends how long the down cycle lasts. So can you talk a little bit about where you want to end up in terms of debt burden? It's good news that you've talked about extra disposal candidates over and above the $5 billion to $10 billion. But talk through how you're going to get the debt down to a more useful level. Patricia E. Yarrington: Ed, the way I look at this or the way we look at this really is that, obviously, when you're at the peak of a price cycle, that's when you want to have restored your balance sheet, have an ultra-conservative balance sheet, and that allows you to come through a price downturn. Right now we're sitting at a 22% debt ratio. We showed a slide at the security analyst meeting that said we could take somewhere between $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental debt. That would take us up to about a 30% debt ratio. There's nothing necessarily magic about the 30%. It was just an indicative place to do a measurement, ourselves versus peers. But I would see as you go through the lows of a price cycle, you would expect your debt burden to increase into the 30%-ish range, maybe a little bit higher on a temporary basis. But if you look through the whole cycle, I think a good place for a company like Chevron with projects that we take on, our size, our scale, our scope, would be probably in the low 20% through the cycle. But getting into the 30%-ish range, we could handle that if it's temporary. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And then a very quick one. Just on the actual quarter, were there any restructuring charges affecting the cash or anything else that we should focus on in terms of the cash generation, or was it more in line with the macro sensitivities that you would have expected? Patricia E. Yarrington: I would say cash from operations was low this quarter operationally, obviously, because of crude price. But we did have the working capital consumption of about $1 billion. And there were several items that were not particularly ratable. Pension contributions were one of those. Affiliate dividends weren't particularly ratable as well. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, Pat. Good morning, Frank. Good morning, Joe. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Doug. Frank Mount : Good morning. Joseph C. Geagea: Good morning. Doug Leggate : Guys, I guess this is a follow-up to Ed's question because the question that seems to be coming up for a lot of the oil industry right now is when do you start re-upping spending in contrast to when do you \u2013 or how far do you repair your balance sheet? Now obviously, with companies of your size, the issue is long-cycle capital projects. In light of your comments just there, Pat, about the balance sheet getting up into the 30%, should we think about you as in harvest mode until you get that balance sheet back to where you want it to be? And I wonder if you could just characterize for us what your appetite is for large-scale new project sanctions. And obviously, at the top of my mind is Tengiz. Patricia E. Yarrington: I'd just go back to our cash flow priorities. Dividend is number one, reinvesting in the business number two. And then prudent financial structure, strong balance sheet is number three. By virtue of the opportunities we have ahead of us in terms of moving towards more short-cycle, frankly, all of the advantages that we have in the Permian, we have growing capital flexibility. So we will see shorter cycle movement there, and that obviously puts less of a strain on your balance sheet because you can adjust those as conditions permit. But we are going to continue to go forward with major capital projects, and FGP [Future Growth Project] is the poster child for that. That's an important project for us, an economic project for us to go forward with. And we will continue to do those. So I think of it as being over time a better balance between short-cycle opportunities and long-cycle opportunities. We're coming off a period that was significantly weighted by long duration, highly capital-intensive projects, and we're moving the portfolio now, our investments now, to a better balance between those. So I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility to not only reinvest in the business in short-cycle, take on selective, high-graded, wonderful projects like FGP, but also then have opportunity to restore the balance sheet. Doug Leggate : Okay, thanks for the answer, Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: Those balancing activities, that will all be part of our balancing considerations as we go forward. Doug Leggate : So there is no debt target as such then? Patricia E. Yarrington: There is no debt target as such. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your question, please. Evan Calio : Hi. Good morning, guys. Frank Mount : Hi, Evan. Evan Calio : I know there has been an increased focus on project execution, emphasized on the third quarter call from John [Watson] and the Analyst Day, more engineering, less reliance on third parties, and more oversight. Maybe, Joe, because you're on the call today, how do these plans increase your confidence in the ability to improve execution as you deliver this broader slate of projects? And where the biggest areas for continued improvement or execution risk as you bring them online? Joseph C. Geagea: Thank you. I'll start by acknowledging that we do some things well. We have delivered good projects. We have Jack/St. Malo. We have the Bibiyana expansion. We have Agbami 3. These are three recent examples where we actually delivered on cost and schedule. Having said that, we and the industry have learned a great deal over the last few years. And the only thing we can do is to actually take those learnings and apply them on future projects. Gorgon Train 2 and Train 3 and Wheatstone Train 1 and Train 2 will benefit from all the learnings on Angola LNG and Gorgon Train 1. All the things, the initiatives we highlighted at the analyst meeting in terms of what it takes to actually improve our chances of execution, we are committed to doing those. We're moving a lot of things in house. We're going to focus on design and engineering. We're going to ensure those designs. We're going to pick the right contractors. We're going to work hard on the right contracting strategy. We need to get projects ready for execution, and we're applying all of those on FGP. And recall the slide we had back in March. FGP is going to be wonderful for us because it is countercyclical. We're going to go into a period where there is capacity in the industry. We're going to go into a period where we will have the right organizational capability working on those projects. And I think it's a tremendous time for us to actually deliver better on those projects. We will have lower execution risk as well on the base shale and tight. We have done look-backs on our short-term investments. And we don't talk about them that much, but they actually beat the expectations always. So as we move into short cycle, we're very confident in delivering those as we take the learnings on the MCPs. Whether it's FGP or other projects we consider doing, I believe our chances of improving execution and delivering those projects should be improved. Evan Calio : That's great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays, your question, please. Paul Y. Cheng: Good morning, guys. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul. Frank Mount : Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng: Joe, I'm just curious. I think a lot of people comment, especially in the U.S. shale. There's high cost deflation maybe coming pretty close to a bottom. So I don't know whether you agree. And also I want to see if you do, does it make sense now to start to lock in the supply cost curve, given that you may be close to a bottom? And how far \u2013 if you guys are willing to do that, how far you may be willing to do it? Joseph C. Geagea: Thanks for the question, Paul. I agree with you, I think our opportunity is to work with suppliers and to see if we can have an arrangement that actually give us a better shot at cost, and we're already having those conversations with our suppliers. Now key to this is how much capital we're going to put into those activities. And as Pat said, we have to consider all the lenses before we commit capital. Our intention is to move in that direction. I believe we have the organizational capability to deliver on this, and the conversations we're having with our suppliers tell us that we can do so. And those conversations with respect to locking in rigs and material give us greater confidence that we can sustain some of the savings and the efficiencies that we're seeing right now, so we're exactly working on the kinds of things you're suggesting. Paul Y. Cheng: Joe, can you comment in terms of that? To what extent are you willing to do say lock in for your expected 50% of your supply requirement for the next five years or lock in for three years, five years, any kind of the magnitude that you can share? Joseph C. Geagea: All I can tell you is that it takes also the supplier to be willing to have those conversations. We clearly have talked about one year, two years, potentially three years in certain areas on rigs, and we're willing to consider that. But like I said, they're going to depend on the program that we have, the pace at which we want to invest, but all of those are on the table. And I think the suppliers are increasingly willing to have that discussion with us. And they're going to see us with the position that I've described earlier in the Permian as a key customer for them. They're going to view those relationships more strategic. They're going to be willing to work with us on everything in the contracts. It's not just the rate that is important. It's that there are a lot of other clauses in the contracts that are importable. So they will see us as a reliable customer with a commitment to the region, and they clearly want to do business with us. Paul Y. Cheng: Thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh: Hey, good morning. Frank Mount : Hey, Phil. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Phil. Philip M. Gresh: Just to follow up on the asset sales commentary, you had talked about $2 billion or so for this year, and so it back-end loads the high end of the $5 billion to $10 billion target. So maybe any additional color you'd have on whether the oil price environment or the asset sale environment in any way pushes you towards the low end or high end of that range? How are you thinking about it now? Patricia E. Yarrington: No, I think what we're really just seeing is acknowledgment that some of these transactions take much longer to close for regulatory approval reasons or whatnot than you might think. And so we're just being cautious in terms of the guidance that we're giving, not only in terms of the $5 billion to $10 billion. We feel that is executable; those are transactable. But pinning it down to whether it's going to happen in the next nine months is very hard for us to say at this point. We have a number of transaction activities underway, and getting the precise timing as to whether it closes in 2016 or it closes in 2017 is where the difficult challenge lies. They can be very lumpy. I do agree it's back-end loaded for this year, we believe. But I think it's also likely to be back-end loaded for the 2016 to 2017 time period. Overall, we still have confidence in that $5 billion to $10 billion range that we've indicated for the two years. Philip M. Gresh: Understood. How much is locked in for 2Q, by the way? Patricia E. Yarrington: I won't give a number completely for 2Q. I'll just say again, for line of sight for this year, we anticipate somewhere around $2 billion, maybe a little bit more. I don't want to get precise on the quarters though. Philip M. Gresh: That's fine, thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: I feel good about April because it's almost closed, but I don't want to get any more precise than that. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Douglas Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Frank Mount : Good morning, Doug. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Doug. Douglas Terreson : Today's commentary seems to emphasize that cost productivity and asset sales and performance from new projects is going to lead to stronger cash flow for Chevron, and that seems pretty reasonable to me. And on this point, I have two questions. First for clarification, does the divestiture under consideration in Myanmar represent the majority of the position in that country? And the second question is somewhat different. If the industry does recover and free cash flow does materialize, the question is whether there are likely to be changes to Chevron's capital priorities over the medium term. And I ask this question because I think Pat talked a few minutes about greater focus on returns being likely in the future, but I don't think much was said about how share repurchases might play into the mix. So just wanted to see if we could get some color on the capital management priorities and how they might change over the medium term, if they do at all. Patricia E. Yarrington: I don't really see our priorities changing over the medium term. I mean, we're consistent in how we use the cash and the priorities we have for that. We've laid out the investment program not only for the rest of this year but for 2017-2018, where it's a shift to the shorter-cycle investments. There will be selective major capital projects that get pushed into the portfolio, pushed into the queue. FGP is obviously the headliner on that. I don't see share repurchases coming into play in the medium term here. That is the last use of cash, and I don't see us being in a position where that would be a relevant item for us in the medium term. In terms of Myanmar, it is a full exit. Douglas Terreson : Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Pat. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Roger D. Read: Thanks, good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Frank Mount : Hi, Roger. Joseph C. Geagea: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read: Just to follow up on the $52 laid out for 2017 and the expectation I guess of cash flow neutrality, the CapEx $17 billion to $22 billion, should we think of the asset sales as what impacts the range of CapEx if the price were to average $52 in 2017, or what are some of the other factors there? Patricia E. Yarrington: No, I think you're asking about the capital flexibility we have between the $17 billion versus the $22 billion. And - Roger D. Read: If oil were $52, what would then determine $17 billion versus $22 billion? I understand the range. I'm trying to understand what would affect which part of the range and whether or not asset sales are part of that assumption. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, so the overall objective is to get balanced in 2017. And obviously, if we're falling short on asset sale proceeds for a reason or other, we would want to take that into account in determining what the capital outlays are because it really is the objective to get balanced. So there would be a tradeoff potentially there if we weren't seeing the execution on asset sales. We don't anticipate that being the case, however. In terms of the prioritization, though, let me just go back to the logic and the process that we have for building up the capital program. We start with the asset integrity and reliability foundation, and then each and every layer of projects above that competes on its merits on a returns-focused basis. And we will balance the short-cycle investments and we will balance initiation and commitment to larger longer-cycle capital projects. Again, the only one of size that's queued up here in the near term would be Future Growth Project. So we will take all of that into account. The overarching objective though is to get balanced on cash in 2017. Frank Mount : Thanks, Roger. Patricia E. Yarrington: And we continue to be very focused on capital discipline, and so there will be high hurdle rates for all of the projects coming forward for possible inclusion in the capital budget. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Anish Kapadia : Hi. I just had a question looking at some of the pre-FID projects. I was wondering if you could give an idea of where the oil price breakeven has come down to for some of these key projects, such as the Tigris complex, some of your Upper and Lower Tertiary discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, and also Rosebank in the UK. And then the second question was just looking at returns, I was just wondering. If you look at things internationally, does anything come even close on a risk-adjusted basis to the Permian just when you take into account the high geological, fiscal, political risk? I'm just wondering how you look at that capital allocation. Thank you. Joseph C. Geagea: Thank you Anish. I'll take the deepwater question first. Just to it put in context, we're already producing about 140,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico in the deepwater, and we do that through five operated assets and four non-operated assets. We're also the largest leaseholder in the Gulf. So in the near term, with that footprint, we do see many brownfield deepwater opportunities. In fact, 80% of our development spend over the next few years is going to be geared toward brownfield development, such as Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti, where we actually have good economics. We've already said the single-well breakeven is typically in the $20 to $40 Brent range. We've also demonstrated tremendous improvement in drilling and completion efficiency, so we continue to bring the cost equation down. Now if we're talking about new greenfield development, we've got a few things that need to happen there. Obviously, we need scale in the resource, but we also need to rethink about how we bring our development. We talked before about optimizing our development concept, where we could be trading lower plateau and maybe NPV for greater capital efficiencies. And this is another place where we actually need our suppliers. We need to work closely with them to continue to drive the cost down. This is an important area for us to be good at, and we're committed to do that. Now in terms of how does the Permian compete, we just can't be a Permian company. We have a lot of other places where actually we have good resources. We talked about Tengiz. We talked about Thailand. We talked about Indonesia. Australia is going to give us those opportunities. So yes, while the Permian give us tremendous advantage, the size of our company will require us to actually be broader and to put our capital in places where we can get good economics but not to be solely a one asset class company. Frank Mount : Thanks, Anish. Anish Kapadia : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets, your question, please. Brad Heffern : Good morning, everyone. I guess with Gorgon coming very close to the finish line at this point, I was wondering if you can give an update on ultimately where the costs are expected to land for that project, and also if on Wheatstone you're still using the same budget. Joseph C. Geagea: I'll start with Wheatstone. We're still operating under the same funding appropriation, which we have communicated to you previously. We do acknowledge we've seen cost pressures. But at the same time, these have been offset by favorable foreign exchange. We're working very hard to mitigate those cost pressures. Earlier this week we had a good review of that project, and we are very encouraged by the progress. I alluded to that in my prepared remarks. So the progress we make over the next eight to 12 months will be very important in terms of where we're going to end up. But for now, there's really no reason to change our view on the cost. And again, Wheatstone is a huge resource base for us, and it is very important to deliver it. Now in terms of Gorgon, we've seen cost pressures on Gorgon. But at the moment, really, we're not going to change the cost estimate that we have provided previously. Frank Mount : Thanks, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James, your question, please. Luana Siegfried : Hi, this is Luana Siegfried in for Pavel. Good morning. Thank you for your call. I have two quick questions on U.S. production. So I was wondering if you could share a little bit more details on U.S. production, which grew only by 0.4% year over year, even with Jack/St. Malo and solid production from the Permian. Frank Mount : I'm sorry, this is Frank. Could you please repeat that? I was confused by the question. Luana Siegfried : Sure, Frank. I was just wondering which plays that are actually in the U.S. are offsetting the growth factors like Jack/St. Malo or the Permian? Frank Mount : So can I repeat? I think you're basically saying where are we seeing some base declines in the U.S. that offset the growth we have in the MCPs. Patricia E. Yarrington: A piece of that obviously is coming from asset sale divestitures if you're looking at first quarter to first quarter. A significant piece of Gulf of Mexico, multiple asset divestments occurred. Luana Siegfried : Perfect. And if I may, I just have another quick one in the U.S. Do you guys have any updates on Bigfoot, the latest startup for the production? Joseph C. Geagea: Is the question about Bigfoot? Luana Siegfried : Yes. Joseph C. Geagea: There is no change from the prior guidance we gave, and that is the second half of 2018. Frank Mount : Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, it looks like that concludes the lineup of questioners. So I want to thank you very much. I want to thank everybody for their time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron, and we appreciate your participation. So, Jonathan, I'll turn it back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our Upstream business prior to my concluding remarks. Turning to slide three, slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets, where through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion. And our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. During the second quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%. Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year to date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items \u2013 for example, those associated with tax loss positions \u2013 reduced year to date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets, and pipeline assets in North America. Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. At quarter end our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion. And our net debt position was $36 billion. Turning to slide five, slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. In both quarters depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Turning now to slide six, I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. Net special items for impairments, project suspensions, and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations in line with our price sensitivity as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million, as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. The variance in the Other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items. Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our Upstream operations. Jay? James William Johnson : Thanks, Pat. I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key Upstream projects. Slide seven compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay, and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day, as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei, and Angola LNG. And we saw initial production from Gorgon. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria, and fires in Canada. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments. The chart shown on slide eight was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable. And we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by mid-year, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015 this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron's share. We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our Upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day. And we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time our long anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all three trains at Chuandongbei. We are also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day. Turning to slide nine, funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity, or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion, and initial operations into Train 2 and Train 3. Construction on Train 2 and Train 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all nine development wells has been completed and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical, and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress, as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning, and startup activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan, with startup expected six to eight months after Train 1. Slide 10 shows our other 2016 startups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant, and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded four LNG and seven LPG cargoes. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. At Chuandongbei, Train 3 started up in late May, and all three trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There have been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul, or Bangka. Turning to slide 11, our next capital priority is to fund high-return short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantaged acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our analyst meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less cost. Turn to slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development costs by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our analyst meeting in March. Our recovery per well is also improving, as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions, and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator whose royalty position provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. Slide 13, in addition to the Permian and other large-scale short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development costs and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high facility reliability and the startup of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month. Turning to Slide 14, a major brownfield opportunity that we've talked about many times is the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Turning to slide 15, FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells, and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending, and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate. Go to slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably. And I'll update you on a few examples. Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment, and labor required to execute the project, and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost, and more effective leadership. Turning to slide 17, we're pleased to see this project enter execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO, and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir. And FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. This counter cyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity, and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future in-field drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants, as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron. And this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future. I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Now turning to slide 18, we are delivering on our committed spend reductions. You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past three years. Year to date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less. For 2017 \u2013 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range, as our primarily goal is to be cash balanced. Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015. And we expect a downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year, as we realize the full-year run rate of organizational actions and supply chain initiatives. Turning to slide 19, just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year to date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion, covering several transactions, New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California, and Upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on the slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price sensitive. And there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable, and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016. I'd like to close the presentation here on slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online. And we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as back-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash balancing program. Looking out the next 12 months to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be; strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretion at the same time. That's a powerful combination, offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to growing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividend, and the value they place on our long history of annual dividend payment increases. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Please do keep in mind that we have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and perhaps one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get everyone's questions answered. Jonathan, can you please open the line? Operator : Certainly, thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please. Philip M. Gresh: Hey, good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Frank Mount : Hey, Phil. James William Johnson : Good morning. Philip M. Gresh: Thanks for all the color in the slide deck today. My two quick questions are going back to the Analyst Day and then tying it to what you said today. The first one would just be on the production growth outlook, looking out to 2017 in the fuzzy bar chart. At the time, at the Analyst Day you had mentioned that the 2.9 million to 3.0 million [barrels per day] target generally still held at that point in time. Obviously there has been a lot of transitory items this year and then there are some asset sales. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of an update as we look ahead to 2017, either on the number itself or some of the moving pieces we should think about with respect to that number. James William Johnson : So I think as we look forward at the production, the thing that's coming through are the major capital projects. And as they start up and we're seeing good performance out of those, I think that part of our performance is very strong. As is the growth coming from assets like the Permian and our other base business. And actually our decline rates have been very good. We will see potentially some decline. We're expecting to go maybe from the 2% into the 2% to 4% range (sic) [zero to 4% range] because of the cutbacks in capital. But we still see pretty good performance from all of our base assets. The asset sales program, we'll give some further updates when we get to the SAM meeting on where we stand there. Some of those were already baked into that forecast. And of course as we move forward and build a business plan this year, a lot of it's going to be responsive to the environment that we find ourselves as we move forward. I think a key thing is that these new barrels coming online from Permian and from these major capital projects are accretive to our existing portfolio. And so we expect to see strong cash generation as we move forward. Philip M. Gresh: Okay. And then my follow up is just on the Permian. At the Analyst Day you had talked about a potential doubling of the capital budget to meet this strong growth profile through 2020. It sounds like the costs are coming in very well. So maybe just talk about how you think about growth versus capital preservation? If you can do more with less, would you focus on reducing the capital? Or would you try and actually increase this production target over time? James William Johnson : We'll give further updates on our production targets I think at the SAM meeting. But what I would say in the meantime is we continue to want to grow our Permian business. So we are adding an additional rig in August. We expect to have a total of four additional rigs. So that's going from six currently to 10 rigs by the end of this year in the Permian. And would expect to see good performance coming from those rigs. One of the things we've tried to do is take a measured pace, so that we preserve the productivity and the capital efficiency that we've been able to capture so far. We want to make sure we do that as we ramp up. And we feel quite confident we can do so. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil. Philip M. Gresh: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Frank Mount : Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey : I think I've got the longest term question I've ever asked here, which is the Kazakh concession expires in 2032. Is that correct? James William Johnson : Yes, 2033. Paul Sankey : 2033. Is that included in your economic assumptions as a sort of end point for the \u2013 I mean I know it's kind of crazy. But obviously if you're investing for stuff in 2022, 10 years, 11 years is not that much later in terms of the scale of the project. Are the economics that you've run assuming that the concession goes away? James William Johnson : Yeah. We base all of our economics and decision-making on the actual end of life of the concession. But obviously there's considerable upside I think both for the country and for the companies if we continue to progress the concession with an extension. Paul Sankey : Got it. Thank you, Jay. Nearer term, were there any special items that we should consider in the cash flow? I asked a similar question to Exxon. That makes this an unrepresentative quarter, because obviously the cash balances right now are not even covering the dividend. Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. Paul Sankey : Is there anything special? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I'd mention two things. I mentioned them in the official comments. One is working capital and the other is deferred tax. And on a year-to-date basis both of them are worth about $2 billion each. From a working capital standpoint, I indicated that we expect a portion of that will reverse this year. The deferred tax impacts will also reverse. And you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case we can either take these back against prior income. Or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case I know for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, are negatives right now, but they become positives in the future. And so when you think about this impact, and it's pretty significant on a year-to-date basis. Again, $4 billion across the two of those. Paul Sankey : Yes. Patricia E. Yarrington: When you take that into account and you think about Gorgon and Wheatstone coming online and the $2 a barrel margin accretion that we gave you over the whole portfolio, our outlook on cash flow generation going forward is quite positive. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Paul Sankey : Could I just ask a quick follow-up? Sorry. The working capital effect, isn't that from prices going up during the quarter? So wouldn't it \u2013 why would it reverse if prices went further up from here? Patricia E. Yarrington: So I mean a part of it is inventory, part of it in this particular time just happened to be cargo timing on receivables versus payables. So we've analyzed it to quite an extent. And we're pretty comfortable saying, somewhere in the neighborhood of at least half of it will go down between now and the end of the year. Paul Sankey : Yes. Patricia E. Yarrington: We obviously are being impacted by lower activity and then just changes in prices and cost structures. Paul Sankey : Thanks, Pat. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Y. Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning. Frank Mount : Hey, Paul. James William Johnson : Hey, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng: Jay, two question in here. First, Gorgon Train 2 and 3, previously I think the expectation is that maybe a little bit sooner. Train 2 will be maybe the third quarter and Train 3 will be the first quarter 2017. And also I think that the historical data that you guys are suggesting 3 months to 6 months of the startup period or the ramp-up period. Now talking about 6 months to 8 months. Is that being just conservative on your part? Or that there's something fundamentally when you're looking at the LNG business lead you to believe that the ramp-up period and everything, that may just take a bit longer than historically has been? James William Johnson : Paul, couple things. We've always said that our expectation is that Train 2 and Train 3 would start up at roughly six-month intervals. And we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2, and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We are seeing very good construction progress on Train 2 and Train 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time, but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make, as we've started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there it's pretty much as we expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been six to eight months. We base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from startup to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with. And so you have periods of downtime, as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on startup, tuning, loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime. And the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that six to eight-month ramp-up period. But again with Train 2 and Train 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1 \u2013 they're identical designs \u2013 it gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second two trains Paul Y. Cheng: Second question on Tengiz future growth project. Maybe I'm wrong, but my current assumption is that if I have, say, $10 on the transportation cost, and 5% is on the price realization to Brent price, and assume a 20 \u2013 there's 18% royalty and 30% income tax, it looks like even at $80 Brent, I only get maybe less than 10% internal rate of return for the full project. I just wanted to see whether you can comment on that, whether that internally that you guys looking for a much better return. And if it's $80, why will you, say, sanction the projects? James William Johnson : So I think our economics are a little bit different than yours, Paul. I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract. But we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail. But it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall \u2013 or sorry, FGP overall, I think there are a couple things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's given us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place because effectively this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz, and we've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant, that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP. And since startup, we've been able to increase the capacity of that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place. And FGP carries incrementally large gas handling capacity, more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits that are yet to come. Of course when we talked about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there are other assessments out there like Wood Mac [Wood Mackenzie]. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched accurate reservoir model, history match model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project than what Wood Mac is counting on. Both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project. Paul Y. Cheng: Thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Frank Mount : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : I wonder if I could have one for \u2013 thanks. I wonder if I could \u2013 one for Pat and one for Jay. Pat, I'm not quite sure how to ask this one, but it's a follow-up to Paul's question about deferred tax. One of your competitors, ConocoPhillips, gave some sensitivities about what the impact of deferred tax is. It's quite meaningful. They say on earnings, every $10 is like $1.5 billion on cash flow. However, up to a certain level, like $60 oil, it's about $2.5 billion for every $10. I'm guessing it's the same kind of thing you're getting at. I'm wondering if you could give some sensitivities around just exactly that issue. Because obviously the deferred tax credit back could be quite material. Patricia E. Yarrington: Doug, it's a great question. I'm not prepared here to give you a sensitivity around it. It is one of the primary areas of exploration, I would say, as we go through our business planning cycle here over the next couple of months. It's a critical element for us to understand jurisdiction by jurisdiction what the price sensitivity is over a variety of price levels. And so it's something I don't have today, but it's something we are investigating ourselves. And in the future we'd be in a better place, off of this current business plan that we're putting together, to be able to address that question. Doug Leggate : My guess \u2013 this is an observation. But my guess is, including myself, a lot of folks are scrambling to understand that. Because I think it could be a big delta on folks' expectations of your future cash flow. My follow up is really for Jay. And I don't know to what extent you can answer this, Jay. But my understanding is John [Watson] was recently in New York over the last several months and was talking about the longer-term spending restrictions if you like, or the level at which he expects to see, beyond your current five-year planning horizon. And more importantly had indicated that the unconventional portfolio could really become a very large part, like 25% of the company by the middle of the next decade. I'm just wondering if you can frame that in terms of implications for additional long cycle projects, and whether my understanding of that is accurate. James William Johnson : I think John's comments about unconventional becoming a larger and larger part of our company are valid. We gave you a capital range of $17 billion to $22 billion for next year. We have both TCO and expansion of our unconventional built into that number already. We're actually getting very granular in our planning of capital allocation across all the assets in the company. And making sure that that capital is flowing to where we expect to get the highest return. Unconventional, with the de-risking that we've been able to do in \u2013 particularly in the Permian. And then the way we're using best practice in one field to spread to all the others we have \u2013 the Marcellus, the Permian, the Duvernay, Vaca Muerta \u2013 is really showing benefits right across our unconventional portfolio. And we're quite excited about the role this is going to play going forward. As to large major capital projects, we will still have some. That's an important part of our portfolio. But we're going to take a measured approach to these. We're only going to be approving the ones that represent the best value for us. And it's going to be in balance with the other opportunities we have, as we maintain a very disciplined capital program going forward. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Doug Leggate : To be clear, Jay, just a point of clarification. That 25% number is broadly right. But it's a global number, not a U.S. number? Frank Mount : Yes. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes. James William Johnson : Yes. Doug Leggate : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please. Blake Fernandez : Folks, good morning. Frank Mount : Good morning, Blake. Blake Fernandez : Jay, I realize you went through the execution readiness on Tengiz. I guess my question is really around the potential for that $6.2 billion of contingency to maybe not even come in at that level. I mean I realize you're pretty well along on several fronts. But is there an opportunity to lock in costs at this point? And I guess I'm just trying to understand, is there a potential to mitigate the risk of that $6.2 billion coming to fruition? James William Johnson : Absolutely there's a chance to mitigate the risk. I mean what we've really tried to do is both be reasonable and as practical \u2013 realistic I should say \u2013 in our view of what contingency is required on these very large projects. And this is based on our past, but also the industry experience in executing these projects. But then what we've tried to do is take our experience on other very large projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone, as well as projects we've done in Tengiz, and build those in. We've looked ahead and said, these are the areas that cause us difficulty on these projects. And we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges. And our work to advance the engineering before FID, but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first steel for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and at the 90% point, and design assurance verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews. And we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced, so that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence. We think all these brought together along with our experience in Kazakhstan is going to help us really stay focused on mitigating any use of that contingency. Contingency is expected to be used. What we're trying to do is reduce the risk and uncertainty, so that we can minimize how much of it we do have to use. Blake Fernandez : Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yes. Good morning. I guess first question just around CapEx and OpEx. You've been making some good progress. And you've got these downward arrows suggesting that in the second half of the year we'll still see further progress. I'm just wondering, maybe just give us an update as perhaps where OpEx and SG&A, where the new bottom of that cost structure could get to? Patricia E. Yarrington: I think on the capital side, we've given you everything that we anticipate at this point in time. Right now we're sitting at the midway part of the year, trending on, yeah, $25 billion sort of range. We think that's where we could end, possibly a little bit lower than that. We're actually trending on $24 billion at the 6-month mark, but we're thinking $25 billion might be \u2013 sorry. $24 billion may be where we end the year. So somewhere between $24 billion and $25 billion I think is the appropriate level for you to think about. And then in terms of 2017 and 2018, we've given you the range there of the $17 billion to $22 billion. But obviously we need to be market responsive. And so right now we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if in fact the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that. Or certainly at the very low end of that range. So that's as much guidance as I can give you on capital at the moment. We're rolling up the business plans. And we'll have more to say as we get towards the end of the year. On operating expense our target really \u2013 we came down on operating expense $2 billion between 2014 and 2015. And our target is to come down another $2 billion between 2015 and 2016. We have a number of organizational impacts that have occurred through the first half of this year, but there will be more that will come in the second half of this year. And we also continue to work through the supply chain. We've got another set of targets internally for continued effort to reduce costs through the supply chain. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And then a question for Jay. One of the criticisms I guess with the majors, which you addressed in slide 12 on the Permian, is the relative costs and the EURs. I mean you have \u2013 I think last year at the Analyst Day, what did I see? It was $7.1 million. And now you're talking about some of the average wells in some of the plays being $5.6 million. And your EURs I think at the Analyst Day were I guess 960 million [BOE] in the Delaware and 850 million [BOE] in the Midland. But obviously the purer plays who've been able to I guess get out on the front foot in terms of press releases are doing a lot of work with completion technology to boost EUR. So maybe just give us some color as to how you see your competitive positioning relative to I guess a lot of the people who are just the other side of the gate? And even in some of the same wells as you? James William Johnson : I think we're now fully competitive with these other players. And we may not be flashy, but we're steady. We have taken all these learnings in. We've been very methodical in our approach and very systematic. Our goal as I said before is to be fully competitive on an operating basis, so that when you add in the advantaged royalty position, it gives us a clear incremental value proposition over competitors. We'll continue to stay focused on this. And as I said we're ramping up the number of company operated rigs. But we're going to do so in a manner that allows us to maintain those efficiencies. The one other thing I'd say is that our current view is that we're building infrastructure into some of these initial development projects. And as that infrastructure comes into play, it provides a solid foundation for us to continue to incrementally improve economics as we move forward. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please. Douglas Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Frank Mount : Good morning. Douglas Terreson : Pat, a few of your competitors recently committed to new capital management plans and performance metrics, by which they plan to be held accountable in the future. And on this point you guys have had a pathway to improve returns in your materials for a few quarters now. And you've clearly made progress on the cost side based on today's results in I think it was Slide 18 or so. So my question is, if oil prices and financial performance recover in 2016 and 2017, can you envision a scenario whereby your financial priorities might shift for an intermediate term period? Let's say a return of capital to shareholders having greater priority than spending for instance. Or do you feel that between the cyclical timing and the low costs that we have today and the quality of your portfolio, that higher spending would almost surely be in the best interest of shareholders? So the question is about how you weigh these different financial options in the recovery scenario? Patricia E. Yarrington: Doug, we've had the same financial priorities for a long period of time. Dividend return to shareholders being first, and then reinvestment in the business second, and then having a prudent financial structure being third. And I don't see those priorities changing going forward. We're going to obviously work to balance those priorities under the circumstances that are presented to us. Douglas Terreson : Sure. Patricia E. Yarrington: I do think \u2013 I don't see that there's significant \u2013 see any increases coming for us. I think we're going to increase our dividend when cash flow permits it. We're going to make the investment profile that we've talked about, where we're moving to shorter cycle, higher return projects. And not as many of the long duration lower return projects. FGP/WPMP is the only significant project that we have taken FID. We do see additional major capital projects in our future. But they're not going to come with the same pace that we have had most recently here. We want to be much more ratable and predictable in our capital program. And we are going to have to take some of the cash that we're generating in the future and use it to restore our balance sheet Douglas Terreson : Sure. So thanks for the clarity and the update. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get an update on two areas of disrupted production. First is the Neutral Zone, and the second is Nigeria, recognizing the latter could have some sensitivities. What update can you provide on the return to production? James William Johnson : So in the Partitioned Zone, this is really an issue between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They continue to engage to work this forward. Our view is that we would like to see a return to production. That's what we advocate. But in the meantime what we've done are two things. We've tried to bring all the preservation work and maintain the field in a state of readiness, so it can be restarted. We've also done quite a bit of work to understand and use the opportunity with our technical people to model the entire field and look for efficiencies that we can build into this field when it restarts. And we've been quite successful in some of the planning that we'd have for the restart. We've also been bringing our cost structures down. And there will be more of that to come as this continues forward. In terms of Nigeria, this is an area where we've operated for a long time. There are some issues there. The government is working these issues. Our priority is on protecting people and making sure that we protect our operations. But I really won't say too much more about it, other than this is an issue that continues to be addressed by the government Neil Mehta : And if I can ask a quick follow-up here. Pat, on your comments on return of capital. For the last two decades to three decades you've raised the dividend every year. Are you still on track to do that in 2016? And just if you can comment on the broader strategy around dividend growth? Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. What I can say is that we're fully aware of the 28-year annual dividend payment increase. We're also fully aware that an increase needs to occur in 2016 if we are to keep that pattern alive. The board fully understands the value of the dividend increase and they understand the value of growing the dividend over time. So the board will be looking at cash generation and our ability from a sustainable sense to support a higher dividend going forward. I guess I would just reiterate. We do see our cash flow circumstance improving over time here. We've got the confidence in our future growth, in production. We've got confidence in our future cash generation. I'll take you back to the $2 per barrel margin increase that we showed at the security Analyst Day on the portfolio. Assuming flat commodity prices, that's the margin accretion that we get out of these LNG projects predominantly. It raises the cash margin on the entire portfolio. And we also believe that we can compete very successfully and sustainably over time here with a much lower capital program because we've got assets, for example, like the Permian and other unconventionals. So we feel very comfortable about what our future holds. Neil Mehta : Great. Thanks, guys. Frank Mount : Thanks very much, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Hi. I guess good afternoon, everybody. Frank Mount : Hi, Evan. Evan Calio : Jay, maybe a follow up on Paul's prior question on Tengiz. It really gets to this concern that it's a lower return project, given future lease expiry or otherwise. I'm not really asking for confidential terms. But can you share any expected project return at sanction? Or how it compared to other projects, while gating in the portfolio even maybe by tier? James William Johnson : I can't really get into divulging our economics and our view of it other than to say we have been very disciplined in our capital. We're putting that capital where we believe it's going to give us a good return. We look at a lot of things when we consider the performance of a project. And part of it is the risk we're taking on as well as the potential for additional upside to be gained, and I talked about those earlier. Ultimately, the economic value of this project will be a function of the prices realized over the period of time between now and the end of the concession. But we're taking a lot of steps to make sure that we're building as much value into this as we can. We see it as an attractive project. Evan Calio : Great, maybe just a brief follow-up if I could. What is the percentage of total project financing targeted here, just to help better understand what the future cash flow, at least out the door, look like? James William Johnson : The financing is really in place as an assist. The entire project is not being funded by the financing. We have a combination of co-lending, we have a bank facility, and we have the bond issuance. So that combination coupled with the cash generation of TCO, which is actually quite strong, should provide sufficient funding for the project as well as ongoing value to the shareholders. Evan Calio : Thanks. I appreciate it, guys. Frank Mount : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks, maybe one follow-up on the Permian. You have a chart there on the slides, which I think is again relative to the Analyst Day presentation, showing the multiyear outlook for growth in the Permian. If you think about the assumptions that are in that chart, both in terms of activity levels and well performance, how would you say that things are trending in the basin right now relative to your assumptions there? Are the wells performing better than assumed in the base case there, activity levels similar? And where would the bias be? Is there an upwards or downward bias do you think for that multiyear outlook? James William Johnson : So you can see the red line shows where we actually are relative to that view, and we're on plan with the initial growth there. And as we said, we saw over 20% growth in the Permian relative to last year. Now that's done even with less rigs. We're running about the same number of rigs we expected on the company side. Our non-operated rigs are actually less. But we're actually accomplishing our objectives with fewer rigs. We're going to be going from six rigs to 10 rigs by the end of this year. So we're staffing up and ramping up our activity level. I would say the bias on this is upward going forward. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks. And then maybe if I could switch gears to the Gulf of Mexico, you've had a number of different projects in various stages of appraisal or development there. Any thoughts on how those resources are shaking up where the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 how you see those types of projects stacking up potentially within your portfolio going forward? And maybe one specific one, one of your partners that was in the joint development project I think for Tiber-Guadalupe-Gibson and those recently impaired leases in those fields, is that project still on plan going forward, or is that one that you guys may be walking away from? James William Johnson : So I think of the projects in two categories. We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they are very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development cost down, and we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig costs go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them right-sized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go with smaller facilities that have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiency. So as we look at driving the cost per barrel and the development costs down, I think that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and ultimately the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't really want to comment too much further, but we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger D. Read: Thanks, good morning. James William Johnson : Good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Frank Mount : Good morning. Roger D. Read: I guess just a quick kind of follow-up on the CapEx side. So looked like you're going to underspend this year potentially, at least on track for it. And you think about the guidance for $17 billion to $22 billion over the next couple years. Should we think about the benefits this year are something that are transitory? Or something that are looking a little more permanent? And then maybe either get more for $17 billion to $22 billion? Or you can potentially underspend $17 billion to $22 billion as we think about the next 3 years? Patricia E. Yarrington: Roger, I think one of the primary drivers in moving from the 2016 circumstance to 2017 and beyond is the trailing off of these projects under construction. I mean just the LNG projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, for example. I mean that is a significant reason behind the drop-off in the capital spending between the years. But also going forward, as we've talked about the portfolio shift that we have, where we have a lot more of our future investment coming forward in this shorter cycle Permian based activity, as opposed to the long cycle and large duration major capital projects, that's really what drives the change in the absolute level of spending. We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at a $17 billion range. So I think of it as being a sustainable sort of capital level under prices that we have today. Roger D. Read: Right, I understood sustainability. I was more just trying to understand of \u2013 is the fact that you're tracking under the $25 billion due I guess more to the large projects that do come to an end? Or are you seeing an actual improvement in sort of underlying spending, service costs, equipment costs, whatever they are? Trying to think about it, is $17 billion to $22 billion, should it really be maybe $15.5 billion to, say, $20 billion, or something like that? James William Johnson : Building on what Pat said... Roger D. Read: On an apples-to-apples comparison. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes. James William Johnson : Yes, building on what Pat said, I think there's a lot of things that drive capital spending. And it can be everything from our current price environment to foreign exchange rates. But what we've really focused on in this near term have been two things. One is driving down the pricing from our vendors and contractors. That's probably more transitory. But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations. And we've talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects. And it's partly doing things better internally. And I've talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects. And that really helps us execute better. And that's sustainable through this period. Frank Mount : Thanks, Roger. Roger D. Read: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please? Frank Mount : Hi, Brad. Brad Heffern : Hi, everyone. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hi. Brad Heffern : I know we're past the top of the hour, so I'll keep it short. I was just curious on the impairment commentary in the prepared remarks, I think weaker reservoir performance was mentioned. Obviously we're all used to seeing price related impairments at this point. But I was curious if you could put a finer point on what assets that related to? Is it all legacy stuff? Or is it anything from major projects over the past few years? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean there were multiple assets involved. But the largest single contributor here was Papa-Terra in Brazil. James William Johnson : Yeah. So Papa-Terra is one where we've been disappointed in the performance of this asset. We have gone ahead and seconded a number of our Chevron people into the operators' team. We're working with the operator to determine not only what is happening with the reservoir, but also where we go from here. So we'll give you more update at some point in the future. But at this point in time it's largely around Papa-Terra and the performance. Frank Mount : Thanks, Brad. Brad Heffern : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I think that wraps us up for the conference call here for the second quarter. I appreciate everybody's interest in Chevron and appreciate your questions in particular. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia Yarrington : Okay, thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President Mid-Continent Business Unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million and special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items, as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the Appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items; for example, those associated with tax loss positions reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion for total proceeds over this year and next. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil or TCO in support of the FGP project. This outflow is reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliates. The first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation, and the project pace of investment. At quarter-end, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. Turning now to Slide 5; Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million, lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim, and the absence of third quarter 2015 assets impairments increased earnings by $535 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem. Turning now to Slide 6; here I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items, and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat rent prices. Lower operational expenses offset essentially by lower listings and adverse tax impacts. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 7; here we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp ups continued at Gorgon Jack / St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production. Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other Brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall basic decline rate to less than 2%. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was the TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second generation plant. Based on nine months of actuals and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. Turning now to Slide 8; as we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor as previously discussed is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget, and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of six weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were onsite for the turnaround. The team work proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation, and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon Train 1 production is stable, and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tons per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine tune the system. Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargos and 16 LPG cargos. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August, and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventional and from our base business investments. Turning now to Slide 9; at Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day which is about 5 million tons per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargos to-date, and with both Trains now running, we expect to ship an average of two to three cargos per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon, and are pleased with our progress. Our modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now onsite and the installation of piping, electrical, and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project cost relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be $34 billion. Chevron share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce? Bruce Niemeyer : Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 10, as we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this we have implemented a well factory modeled at the most -- modeled after the most efficient short cycle operations in Chevron and in industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable high value outcomes at sufficient scale that our material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we have identified and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve. Turning the Slide 11; you can see Chevrons acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron operated developments in blue and are non-operated development areas in purple. We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple stacked geologic targets. Today we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional $350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix; some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price, and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. We're active in several company operated and non-operated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up on our ninth rig as we speak, and expect to be at ten by the end of the year. Another ten rigs are currently drilling our non-operated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil gas split, availability of surface infrastructure, and our overall certainty of outcome. Turning to Slide 12; to achieve strong returns we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow; capital efficiency, operating expense, and product realizations. The graph in the upper right corner shows development cost per barrel which in our view is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all sub metrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities, and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense; the lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense, and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades. So attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. Additionally, G&A which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain, rather than simply selling production at the well-head. Because of this we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. Turning to Slide 13; we expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed, to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow. Now I'll hand it back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat? Patricia Yarrington : Okay, thank you, Bruce. Now on Slide 14; we continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the charts the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range, previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays, in fact potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with a lower for longer price environment. Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed, sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment which is underpinned by confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth, notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well, and Train 2 is successfully online, and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next five quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these five trains sold under long-term contracts, and at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost. Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course we are not resting on these recent accomplishments, we will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low price world, our Permian assets they speaks directly to this. Here we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns focused manner. With cost coming down with C&E and capital intensity coming down with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I've just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value are key components supporting that objective. So this concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question or perhaps one follow-up if necessary, we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, could you open the lines, please? Operator : Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason gamble from Jefferies. Your question please? Jason Gammel : Thanks very much everyone. And thanks especially for the incremental disclosure on the Permian, I'd like to direct my question there. Bruce, you mentioned that the finding and development cost was probably one of the most important metrics that you have in the basin. Can you talk about how you are benchmarking yourself against some of the E&P companies in the basin and how you think that might improve as you get your infrastructure into place? Bruce Niemeyer : Thanks for the question, Jason. On Slide 12, we showed finding and development cost per barrel. The lighter bars are the Chevron operated activity, and the darker bars are those of our and NOJV competitors where we also invest. The -- that is our best direct benchmarking comparison because we invest in the wells and we're able to see the full value chain that is created. We are able to address the issues directly at financial performance that aren't often available from a less complete dataset. I suppose there is a narrative that a company of our size can't be competitive but in the case of Chevron, we are. The NOJV partners that are listed on this chart are some of the best in the basin, and you can see on the chart that our performance today is competitive and improving. Jason Gammel : That's great. If just as a follow-up, can you maybe address the pace of development that you think you could achieve? I recognize that you've got your projection of volumes through 2020 but with such huge acreage position, what type of rig program do you think you could ultimately apply in the basin? And then I suppose the other question there would be, just given the position you have, would you maybe consider monetizing some of the position through acreage sales or through joint ventures? Bruce Niemeyer : Let me start with pace first. So we are already growing; as I noted, we've initiated the growth, in fact we've added five rigs over essentially the second half of 2016. That's the pace of rig additions of about one rig a month. Productions grown from the third quarter of last year by 24% further supporting the notion that we're growing. And our pace and rate of indications [ph] are intentional. Again, we're focused on returns -- I don't feel capital limited in the Permian Basin, and our additions are targeted to ensure that we're getting the outcomes we intend and that are supportive of high returns and eventually generate -- generating free cash flow. We do expect to grow, as you noted you can see that on the Slide 13. And as we go forward, we have options; we continually monitor our performance and we adjust. Patricia Yarrington : And Jason, let me just add a thought to that. As you know, we have had a practice when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't a longer term strategic value or it felt others could -- would offer more value for us and it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales and we've had a very routine practice of asset sells over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process though is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there has been a great deal of fluidity in that valuation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding but there still has been significant movement. In some cases pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000 fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of -- if in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do a valuation an appraisal work -- get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer term development plan, than -- that of course we would look to other monetization options. Bruce Niemeyer : Thanks, Jason. Jason Gammel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please? Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. Thanks. A follow-up for Bruce on the Permian. How much do you guys spending there annually? Could you give us an idea of the level of CapEx and the outlook for CapEx? Bruce Niemeyer : Yes, Paul. We're spending presently in the area of about $1.5 billion annually, across both the company-operated and our non-operative joint venture programs. Paul Sankey : So the outlook for that is flat is it or is that going to go up? Bruce Niemeyer : I would expect it to go up. The -- at our current pace we're delivering a growth profile, you can see on Slide 13 what we shared at the Analyst Day last March in terms of production growth and there will be some growing activity that would support that. We are continually getting more efficient and so the -- the capital invested that we expect going forward will be more efficient as kind of reflected by the finding and development cost trend that we showed on Slide 12. Paul Sankey : Understood. So if I look at the Tengiz expansion, you are spending -- previously in September you had said $18 per BOE of development cost for I think a $36 billion investment. Why would you be spending so much less in the Permian at what I think looks like a $10 F&D cost per barrel? Maybe that one is for Pat. Patricia Yarrington : Yes, it is. So Paul, just a couple of things; I mean if you go back to Slide 13 here, I think we have said that -- and we said this back in the same and throughout the year here that we could see that top like -- the top end of that light blue portion of the profile there would result in approximately a doubling of our current activity levels. And so we're spending 1.5 here, you can see us potentially doubling that, and that is kind of the current view that we have but again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the Future Growth Project and -- I think you know it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects -- these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the well-head pressure management project because the field would go into decline, it would be in serious decline and that would be loss of value in the legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies that's a joint development concept, and there is a lot of upside that has not been kind of built-in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say about FGP that relate to the debottlenecking, what we've been able to demonstrate in the past -- we hope to be able to do on a go forward basis. There is additional gas handling facilities built in here that will overtime allow greater oil production, contingencies we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent, even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FIB. And then of course down the road, obviously we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there is a lot of potential upside to FGP, I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters. Paul Sankey : Got it. So what you are saying is the $18 is a very conservative -- $18 per barrel development cost is a very conservative number and it would be competitive with the Permian ultimately when all of these things are considered? Patricia Yarrington : We think we need both assets in our portfolio, yes. Paul Sankey : Thank you, Pat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please? Paul Cheng : Good morning. Two questions if I could. Bruce on the -- what is the recovery rate that you use to get to that 9 billion barrel? Are you just saying 10%, 12% -- what do you expect and foresee that recovery rate may change over the next, say five years? Bruce Niemeyer : Yes. So the 9 billion barrels is from a portion of our acreage that is currently highly characterized, it varies by horizon and by area in the basin, be it Midland or Delaware Basin; recoveries are generally single digit and we know that in a basin were to play at the state of maturity there is a lot of upside potential. We have a technology organization that's working hard every day to take the first stage of development and improve upon it, much as we have in other asset classes that we operate in and are more mature. Paul Cheng : Will you be willing to give in what the forecast -- what that recovery rate may look like in five years? Bruce Niemeyer : No, not at this point. Paul Cheng : Okay. Pat, a second question then on Wheatstone, you're talking about the cost increase. Given the lower Australian dollar and supposedly weaker labor market which has translated into better productivities; can you elaborate a little bit more on what's causing the cost increase? Patricia Yarrington : Sure, Paul. As I said, we're now expecting a $34 billion total project cost. So that's up about $5 billion from the original AR. That original appropriation request was taken in 2011 and as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yard, it came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards, but even so, modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete and so the rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured, the engineering definition -- the definition -- the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say the second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know we had FGP when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement practices that we're putting in place for future projects. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please? Phil Gresh : Good morning. Bruce, you had made a comment on one of the earlier questions about free cash flow focus and I'm just kind of wondering if you take together what you've said about capital spending and the production outlook; when would you expect the Permian to become free cash flow positive? And how do you think about some of the assets in the Permian that might need some more material infrastructure spending? Is that something that you guys are really willing to spend a lot of money on in the next few years or are you more focused on kind of more immediate cash flow? Bruce Niemeyer : Thanks for the question Phil. We'll provide more color and specifics in the Analyst Day next March. We do have internal projections on when the overall program reaches free cash flow, and that obviously depends on a number of factors including the trajectory that we pursue and I'll remind you again, we have many options to adjust based on the results that we see. We do have an integrated approach where we not only connect the upstream activity that we're engaged in drilling and completing wells, but pair that with midstream activity to move our product to the market centers that we choose. We typically engage in that through commercial transactions; it's a very competitive basin, there is a lot of companies that operate in that space. We typically deploy our capital in the areas where we can differentiate our performance and drilling and completions, and then working with high quality third-party suppliers, look to them to move the crude to market, operate the gas processing and NGL fractionation activities. Phil Gresh : Okay, got it, thanks. And then my follow-up -- I guess maybe this would be best for Pat, kind of following on what Paul was asking about $10 F&D in the Permian, $18 for Tengiz. Where would you say -- as you're assessing the deepwater opportunities in the portfolio, particularly the brownfield side of things; how would that stack up at this stage as costs continue to come down? Patricia Yarrington : Brownfield would be very good. Greenfield would be a little bit more challenge but brownfield would be very good. Phil Gresh : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please? Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Pat and Bruce and Frank, I am not sure who wants to take this one -- but I guess that Chevron has always been a company led by large-scale major project developments, explorations, and so on. And I guess what I am really trying to understand here is what are the limiting factors on the Permian given its flexibility, lower execution risk, the absence of the cost issues you've have had and things like Gorgon and Wheatstone. I guess what I'm asking is -- is the Permian big enough to drive a much more meaningful strategic shift and how it allocates -- Chevron allocates capital longer-term? Is that what we're looking at here? Patricia Yarrington : I think best if I take that one here, Doug. I think when you have such an extraordinary asset base in the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense. Such huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single asset class company; so we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, we have the Tengiz project that we talked about, we have the LNG project. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio over here and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian. But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle high-return attributes does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental but the dollar is going to go and I think Permian will get the first call but we will manage it as a portfolio, and overtime you should still expect us to have some significant other projects but we can pace those projects quite nicely I think and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities the Permian provides for us. Doug Leggate : So is it pretty simply, Pat, the Permian is going to take market share from the rest of your portfolio, is that a good way of thinking about it? Patricia Yarrington : I think that's reasonable within limits. I think that's reasonable, yes. And we'll go through more of this in the Security Analyst Meeting, we'll go through more of this in March because I think that's really where it's the appropriate time to lay out on portfolio. Doug Leggate : And I guess a related question my follow-up is; there has been -- we haven't talked much about disposals and I guess in a couple quarters. I am guessing a high grading exercise, if you want to call it that way, the Permian changes the map a little bit in terms of what competes for capital. There has been some speculation around Bangladesh which is sizable obviously, I think you have talked about that publicly. Can you just give us an update as to where you see the changing map on disposals, both in scale and perhaps any identified assets that have changed since the Analyst Day? Patricia Yarrington : Yes. We really haven't changed our view -- I mean we look at asset sales when we can get good value, that's first and foremost; not strategic or we don't see kind of the compelling relationship within the Chevron portfolio. We've announced certain assets for sale and we've put a list out in the second quarter there; the list essentially is the same, I can't confirm that there are commercial discussions going on in and around Bangladesh. But I'll go back to the primary element here which is, we want to get good value. And so on any of these transactions that we've sort of queued up and are beginning to have people into data rooms, either in an early round or a secondary round -- if in fact we don't get the value proposition that we're seeking, then we'll just move on. Doug Leggate : Thanks very much. Bruce Niemeyer : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please? Ed Westlake : Yes, good morning. So that Slide 12 is great, and shows how you've made improvement. I mean I guess you're still a little bit above the development cost of the non-operated JV partners, maybe is that geographical, is there some different ways that you approach the business? So just maybe some color on that. Bruce Niemeyer : Sure, Ed. We're providing you on this chart quarterly data and it's an aggregation of everything that was completed in that particular quarter, and you're right to suspect that there is a little portfolio aspect to what goes on in any particular quarter. We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware basin on the company operated side, and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see two quarters where the company operated bars are a little lower and the last two quarters whether the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland Basin, mile and a half laterals and ROE comparable in that activity or not and what do we address about that. So the overall performance is competitive and I will tell you that there is a competitive group, there is a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing and because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in the new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period. Ed Westlake : And then I mean -- I mean this is just a great portfolio with also tax and royalty advantages. And you will want to get after it; the rest of the industry is getting after it. Maybe just give us some high-level thoughts about inflation. On the one hand there is probably still learnings that can improve that development cost as you progress. On the other hand, things might get a little hot over the next few years. So maybe just some high level thoughts as to how you think about that? Bruce Niemeyer : We've certainly driven in the last two years to a very positive position. We operate in a dynamic price environment and dynamic activity environment. Over the last few years we really leverage the scale of Chevron where we have an advantage to do so. So tubulars or the pipe that goes in the wells is a key cost component and Chevron buys a lot of pipe around the world; so we're able to leverage our worldwide supply chain effort to bring advantage to pricing to what we do. We also consolidate work with key suppliers -- have consolidated work to give us the right combination of unit price, execution performance access to technology and the ability to grow with us. And then we've put in place some contractual arrangements with unit based fixed terms, some are index based, some use performance incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve, irrespective of what commodity prices are doing. Structurally the things that stay with us in any price environment are multi-well pad designs which we've done for a very long time, the acreage position that we have that allow us to drill longer lateral lengths, efficiencies as we engage in on a daily basis in terms of something we call zipper fracing [ph] where you have activities occurring simultaneously. And those will stay us regardless of what price does. Ed Westlake : Thanks, Bruce. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please? Neil Mehta : Good morning, everyone. Pat, really good progress here on capital spending. Where do you believe we're tracking relative to guidance here in 2016 for CapEx? And then relative to the $17 billion to $22 billion, any early look of how the deflation you've seen in '16 will carry forward? Patricia Yarrington : Yes, so I think we had said before that 2016 we thought would come in at 25, around 25. I think last time I said even below 25 and this time I'm really thinking we'll probably be closer to 24. So significant reduction from a year ago time. We're in the process of doing our business plan, right now the range that we've put out for '17 to '18 is in the $17 billion to $22 billion range. I think we will be in that range, we're just going through and doing the prioritization at the moment and we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan and I don't really want to get ahead of that but obviously all of the efficiencies, the cost efficiencies that we've seen -- Bruce just talked through some of those in his business unit but those are going on around the globe in terms of supplier optimization, supplier rationalization, and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue and I think we will hold onto that. The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will all will be the Permian because that's where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening in the rest of the world; investment is not going to those locations. So we're not seeing those kind of cost pressures, so we believe the efficiencies through the supply chain organization we've been able to capture will hold there. Neil Mehta : That is a good follow-up. And maybe this is for Bruce here, as you see activity pick up in the Permian, do you see any bottlenecks, either from an infrastructure perspective, labor perspective, or other parts of that resource that will make it difficult for you to achieve the high-end of the range that we talked about? Bruce Niemeyer : We certainly recognize Neil that we have to plan ahead and we do so. When you think about takeaway, our efforts in maximizing realization have a secondary component which is flow assurance to make sure that we're able to move to the market centers locations where we ultimately wish to sell without being disrupted. When you get to the supply of drilling and completing wells, the suppliers that we work with, we pick intentionally, in part for their ability to grow; both in terms of the availability of the equipment, the type of equipment we want, and their staffing plans in terms of how they will staff and maintain that staffing going forward. So there will be some changes overall in the basin but we're taking a multi-year view and able to look a little bit into the future and based our planning around that. Neil Mehta : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please? Blake Fernandez : Good morning. Pat, going back to some of the -- back to the deflationary pressures you're seeing on CapEx. I think you alluded to a $50 Brent breakeven which is pretty consistent with what you had articulated before. Is it fair to think that that number is trending lower also? Patricia Yarrington : We are working very hard to get that number lower, absolutely. And it certainly has moved down from when we first put that target out there, yes; meaning our actuals are moving in that direction. So yes, we are trying as best we can through operating efficiencies, capital efficiencies to have our outflows contained relative to the inflows that we anticipate coming out there. So it's what I consider to be a cost structure reset and a capital expenditure reset given the environment that we're in. Blake Fernandez : Okay, fair enough. And then, Bruce, on the Permian, it looks like you are trending above the top end of guidance or your range. Obviously you're adding rigs, we probably haven't seen the full impact of that yet. Is there any reason to believe that you are not on-track to potentially surpass what the upper-end of this range is here? Bruce Niemeyer : Well, we're ahead now and our guidance remains the same at this point to 2020, 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a day. Our Analyst Day in March is the typical time where we would unpack more of that for you and everybody else. Blake Fernandez : Good deal, I appreciate it. Bruce Niemeyer : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? Evan Calio : Good afternoon and good results today. My first question, staying with the Permian; Bruce I know some of your acreage in Southwest Reeves overlaps Apache's recently announced Alpine High Play. Can you share your view on the viability of that play, potential economics and how that would or may compete for capital with this Permian core that you have laid out today? Bruce Niemeyer : Sure, Evan. Let me start first by saying we're excited by this activity and hope it's fully successful. We have 180,000 acres in our portfolio and you can see it there on the slide. But it's a great example of how our strategy has played out across the Permian allowing the industry to de-risk and create data that can refine our assessment. Alpine High, that area in the southern part of Reeves County is right now on our overall portfolio pie, in that wedge it is -- that is labeled less than $20,000 per acre, subsurface. And the subsurface is structurally more complex, it appears to be a little more gassy and it's far from existing infrastructure. But additional positive data certainly has the potential to move that area to higher value and if it does, we go through a regular resort of priorities and we would adjust our activity as that indicated. Evan Calio : Great. And then maybe my second is -- it's a follow-up to some prior Permian questions. But just to understand, I mean does the upside to your Permian production range, which is the same as it was in May despite improvements here; does that represent the limit to how much you can grow in a capital efficient manner and maybe that looks achievable on a 30-rig program by the end of 2020? And if so, like what are the limiting factors in your current plan to how much the Permian can take and subsequently grow? Bruce Niemeyer : Our focus in the near-term and quite frankly throughout is on capital efficiency. And we are focused not on chasing a particular production curve -- growing production is important, growing bond is important but retaining efficiency throughout what we do, and we have many options; going forward to adjust our pace of activity up and down. We have the ability to grow activity but it is returns that we are ultimately focused on and that will drive our decision making going forward. Evan Calio : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please? Brendan Warn : Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you are sitting in the world. I'm going to ask a question away from the Permian if I can; if I could just get an update on Rosebank in the UK North Sea, just in terms of -- I know you are out sort of rebidding and renegotiating. Just how you're seeing that project stack up in terms of its cost? And if you can give any update I can have a follow-up, please. Patricia Yarrington : Well, I think all I can say at this point -- I mean we are in essence staying with that project in feed while we're trying to get the development costs down. So I don't have a lot of specific information to provide for you but obviously with what's happened to oil prices, what's happened to the optionality that we have here in the Permian; there is a competing for capital element that Rosebank has to fight for within our portfolio. So when I was continuing to work at it -- we've recognize how important Rosebank is to the region, we recognized how important it is to the U.K. but we have in the past been able to take a look -- a second look at the design and get costs down. In the past we've been able to kind of re-characterize the subsurface and work improvements in there, and we're just still on that same process. Brendan Warn : And then a follow-up, just how much would the weaker pound assist that project in terms of economics? Patricia Yarrington : Obviously it would help but I don't have the ability to quantify that for you at the moment. Brendan Warn : Okay, thank you. Thanks, Pat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please? Anish Kapadia : Hi, my first question was on some of your other potential international project sanctions. I wanted to get a little bit of an update on the Gulf of Mexico projects, where you are at in terms of the appraisals and potential development. So the ones I was thinking of were the Anchor projects, the Tigris project and Sicily. Patricia Yarrington : So an anchor we're still in the appraisal process; we feel positive about it but we're still in the appraisal process there. On the Tigris there is multiple fields that are involved here; appraisal drilling has been completed and we have filed for a suspension of production here. Officially [ph], we've allowed to leases to elapse. Anish Kapadia : Okay, thank you. And then I had a question for Bruce on the Permian. Again, thank you for the useful slides that you've put out. In terms of the -- high graded area that you have talked about, the 600,000 acres; within that I was wondering if you could give some idea of the number of locations that are contained within that in your current thinking. And which benches you're looking at are you currently thinking are going to be developed in that acreage? Bruce Niemeyer : The areas that are at the top of our Q vary between the Midland and Delaware Basin as do the horizons. The things that we're most interested in are again those that create the right kind of full cycle returns. And so the oil/gas split between those areas, the cost of execution of those areas are what causes it to be in the Top Tier for us. So in the Midland Basin, Wolfcamp B and lower Sprayberry are two area -- are two horizons that we like a lot. We also like some aspects of the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin. We're drilling wells in a few other horizons but there isn't a one-size fits all; you'll move to one part of the basin and that particular horizon that you're interested in is just not as great a value as others. So what we do in these development areas is -- put together a strategy that paces development based on value. We go to best performing horizon on a return basis first, and then follow it with the others. And that -- there is not a simple answer that's fits the whole basin. Anish Kapadia : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please? Ryan Todd : Hi, thanks. Great result, maybe I'll stick up on the trend and ask one Permian question followed by another one. In the Permian, if you look at your acreage, if you look on the map on 11, and you've shown this map a number of different times but I mean you've still got a lot of checkerboard acreage across core portions of the Permian basin. Any further interest at this point in potential JVs or partnerships like you did with Cimarex in the past that would allow for an increasing amount of long laterals and capital efficient developments? Or how do you think about managing that acreage going forward? Bruce Niemeyer : It's a good question. We are actually very actively engaged in swaps working with individuals that we don't have rights to checkerboard at acreage and we've actually executed quite a number of those, it does allow us to extend laterals, concentrate facilities and infrastructure in certain places. We will also contemplate joint ventures where that leads us to the right kind of return outcomes. If a combination of acreage in some way leads to a more efficient result but I would tell you that what's been more active for us in the last year and a half has been finding acreage consolidations that we can make through swaps and that's bolstered by the fact that our company operated execution is becoming highly efficient, and those are the sorts of activities that are driving returns to the top of our Q. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could ask one -- maybe a question for Pat there, kind of a high-level philosophical one. I mean if we -- if we look at what the majors such as yourself have been able to do in terms of capital reduction over the past couple years; I think it's been quite impressive. And as we look forward over the next let's say two to five years, and I realize there is a lot of variable in this. How do you think about what a reasonable level of sustainable CapEx is? I mean if you talk about potentially being sub-$20 billion a year in a 2017, is -- has there been enough structural cost deflation or efficiency gains that that is kind of a reasonable medium-term level to think about longer-term? Or does that still feel like capital starvation mode and there is a need to bounce back into some level in the 20s as more sustainable over the medium-term? Patricia Yarrington : Yes. So I think the critical variable that you're leaving unsaid there is what's happening to price. You know just a little bit on price, I think our own view here is that in the medium-term here we're potentially going to be range bound; we are constructive on price and we do think overtime, here you will -- there will be price appreciation but we see it being relatively modest. But in the period that we're talking about here, I don't see that change -- changing our view of the $17 billion to $22 billion range being appropriate for us. You are hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have and the great thing about that is -- that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible and so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years. And the only other major project that we've sanctioned at this point in time is TCO and our share of that in terms of an outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider that to be very manageable and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you. So I think that's a reasonable range on C&E to expect for us under a regional -- a reasonable range of prices that might be anticipated. Okay, I think we have time -- all right, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off but I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please? Pavel Molchanov : Thank you, guys. Just a quick one about Nigeria. You mentioned losing 28,000 a day in Q3. What kind of recovery have you seen on your Nigerian assets so far this quarter? And what is embedded in the exit rate guidance that you gave for the year? Patricia Yarrington : Well, I mean I think we have two factors going on; we have had some instances of sabotage as we've talked about, we had a more recent one here in the last couple of days. So that's it -- obviously a detriment that is impacting Nigerian production. But on the opposite side we've got a [indiscernible] expense \u2013 extension, plateau extension investment coming online. So I think that it's not a huge factor in terms of a variance and what we're showing for the December exit range. Pavel Molchanov : I appreciate it. Patricia Yarrington : Okay, thanks. All right, so I think that concludes our call for the third quarter here. I'd like to thank everybody for your time on the call. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everybody's participation on the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please, go ahead. John Watson : Thanks Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Okay, let's start with the key messages on Slide 3. I've said we needed to do five things well to adjust the lower prices. First, finish project under construction which reduces spend and brings on new revenue. Gorgon Train 1 and 2, Shandong Bay, Bangka, Alder, Angola LNG are all on production and stable. In 2017 progress will continue with Gorgon Train 3 and Wheatstone coming online. Second, we need to reduce capital expenditures and focus on work that's profitable lower prices. 2016 capital was down 34% or $11.6 billion from 2015. We're further reducing capital spending in 2017 and investing a larger percentage of capital in short cycle high return opportunities presented by our advantage portfolio. Third, we are lowering operating expenses by getting more efficient in all that we do. 2016 operating expense was down 9% or $2.5 billion from 2015 and we expect further reductions in 2017. Fourth, we need to complete planned asset sales. We're on track with $2.8 billion in proceeds in 2016 and we expect 2017 proceeds will likely move us toward the upper end of the 2016, 2017 guidance range of $5 billion to $10 billion we previously communicated. And finally we need to do all of this while operating safely and reliably. The result, free cash flow is improving with momentum building through 2016. We expect to be cash balanced in 2017 and the cash flow improvement continuing to 2018 and beyond. Our actions support our number one financial priority which is maintaining growing the dividend as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. Turn to Slide 4, Chevron's total shareholder return outpaced our major competitors and the S&P 500 in 2016 and is number one relative to our peers for any cumulative holding period going back 20 years. We appreciate the support from our investors but recognize markets are forward-looking and expectations are high. We need to continue to deliver on our commitments and manage our advantage portfolio for growing cash flow and competitive returns. Pat will not take you through the financial results. Pat Yarrington : Okay. Thank you, John. Turning now to Slide 5 which is an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $415 million or $0.22 per diluted share while earnings for the full-year 2016 were a loss of $497 million. Excluding special items and foreign exchange, Chevron earned $1.8 billion in 2016. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Fourth quarter results were impacted by non-routine item and timing effects. Downstream results were weak reflecting adverse timing affect because of a rising crude price environment and an extensive turnaround at the Richmond refinery, a once in every five year event. At the same time, fourth quarter corporate charges which are known to be non-ratable were heavier than in average quarter. Our debt ratio at year was 24%. During the fourth quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.29 per share. 2016 was our 29th consecutive year of an annual per share increase. We currently yield 3.7%. Turning to Slide 6, cash generated from operations was $3.9 billion during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter cash flow benefited from stronger oil prices but had offset the seasonal downstream margin patterns and the Richmond refinery turnaround. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow totaled $12.8 billion, a function of low oil and gas prices and weaker downstream margins than in 2015. 2016 working capital consumption of approximately $600 and lower affiliate dividends relative to earnings reduced operating cash. We had deferred tax items of nearly $4 billion for example those associated with tax loss positions. These will benefit cash in future periods. Proceeds from assets sales for 2016 were $2.8 billion. Cash, capital expenditures were $4 billion for the quarter and about $18 billion for the full year excluding expense expiration. This continues a trend towards lower outlays. At year end our cash and cash equivalents totaled $7 billion. Our net debt stood at $39 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 21%. Turning to Slide 7. Slide seven compares 2016 annual earnings to 2015. Full year 2016 results were a loss of $497 million or approximately $5 billion lower than the 2015 results. The impact of special items primarily due to lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings by $515 million. Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by about $710 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $798 million between periods as lower realizations were only partly offset by lower operating costs and exploration expense. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by $2.8 billion, primarily due to lower margins. Recall that 2015 downstream margins were among the strongest we\u2019ve seen in a number of years. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects higher cooperate charges and interest expense. Full year 2016 results are in line with our standing guidance of $350 million to $400 million in net charges per quarter for the other segment. Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2016 with the third quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter sales were approximately $870 million lower than the third quarter. The absence of third quarter 2016 gains from special items reduced earnings by $290 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $50 million between periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased approximately $850 million between quarters, primarily reflecting crude utilization, higher volumes and lower taxes. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were lower by $765 million. This outcome was primarily driven by decreased volumes and increased operating expense, associated with the Richmond refinery turnaround, lower worldwide margins and an unfavorable swing in inventory timing effect. The variance in the other segment is largely driven by adverse tax effects and corporate charges. These impacts are non-ratable and tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And now I'll turn it back to John. John Watson : Okay. Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, 2016 capital spending was $22.4 billion, that's approximately $4 billion less than our original budget and more than $11 billion lower than last year. Cash C&E was $18.7 billion. Productions are mainly from finishing our major projects under construction, pacing and hi-grading future investment and realizing efficiency gains and supplier cost reduction. In December we announced a total capital and exploratory budget for 2017 of $19.8 million which is right in the middle of our $17 billion $22 billion guidance range for the period out to 2020. Cash, capital and exploratory expenditures, which exclude affiliate spend are expected to be $15.1 billion. 70% of our expenditures in 2017 will generate cash flow within two years, reducing cash flow cycle time and financial risk. 2016 operating expense was $25 billion better than we had most recently guided and more than $2.5 billion less than last year. We're sizing the organization to fit the work we anticipate. Our employee workforce is down $9,500 since the end of 2014. We've improved work processes and have negotiated better rates from contractors and vendors. Upstream operating expenses excluding fuel are down nearly $3 per barrel since 2014. Most significant workforce reductions are behind us, but our focus on improving efficiencies in all aspects of the business continue and we expect further progress on OpEx in 2017 and beyond. Slide 10 shows the sources of changes in production between 2015 and '16. 2016 net production was $2.6 million barrels per day. Growth continues from completing and ramping up major capital projects, our short cycle shale and base business work was excellent particularly in light of significant reductions in spending. We limited declines in mature fields by improvements in reliability and drilling work and an effective work-over program. Production was impacted by the ongoing shut in of the partitioned zone, security issues in Nigeria and Gulf of Mexico asset sales. Looking at the fourth quarter bar, you'll see the fourth quarter was strong and production growth is accelerating. As we start the year two trains at Gorgon are running near capacity. Angola LNG is operating well and the successful Agbami and TCL maintenance shutdowns are behind us. We expect production growth this year of 49% at $50 per barrel before asset sales. The uncertainty reflects variables such as the speed of major capital project ramp ups, external events such as the timing of the partitioned zone restart and ultimate base decline rates. Growth comes from a number of areas. First, we expect to see full-year production from project started up in 2016. Gorgon train one and two, Shandong Bay, Angola LNG, Alder, Bangka and we also expect to see partially a contribution for project starting up in 2017, Gorgon Train 3, Wheatstone and Mafumeria Sul for example. Shale and tight production headlined by the Permian will also show growth as we take advantage of our valuable acreage. Base declines along with full year 2017 impacts of sales consummated in 2016 will both reduce production. The impact of 2017 asset sales on the timing -- on the timing of the close of the individual transaction is one variable. Our current estimate is a reduction of 50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. Turing to Slide 12, the chart on the left side shows our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range for asset sale proceeds for 2016 and 2017. In 2016 we made good progress with $2.8 billion in proceeds as we sold assets for value that were not essential to delivering on strategy, didn't compete for capital, with our current opportunity set and were worth more to others than to us. Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017. We expect proceeds close to the top of the guidance range. With new assets coming online in the benefits of portfolio actions, we expect to increase cash margins. The chart on the right shows a doubling of production in the more than $25 per barrel category and a reduction in low margin barrel. Despite a sharp reduction in capital spending we have a strong reserve replacement year exceeding 100% before asset sales for the one and five-year periods. We saw significant adds from the final investment decision on TCO's future growth project. Additionally there are reserves added from improved reservoir characterization in several areas and strong well performance in shale and tight and various other locations. Lower commodity prices benefited entitlement volumes from profit-sharing and variable royalty contracts. This was partially offset by lower economic produce ability in a few assets. Asset sales resulted in a RRR reserve replacement rate slightly below 100% consistent with the expectation of 2017 asset sales impacting production we also expect an impact on 2017 reserves from the sales. Let's talk now about some of the major activity starting with Gorgon. Gorgon currently is stable with growth output of over 200,000 barrels a day and 130 million cubic feet of domestic gas output, a total of 39 cargos have been shipped 10 since the beginning of the year. Train 1 ramp up was below expectations as we work through start-up issues we've discussed previously. All learnings from Train 1 were applied to Train 2 and consequently Train 2 ramped up over 90% of capacity within a week and continues to exceed expectations. Train 3 is also expected to benefit from these learnings. Construction is complete and we're well into startup and commissioning. We expect first LNG early in the second quarter of this year. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are on the foundations and the site is under permanent power. Ongoing hook up and commissioning of the offshore platform is the critical path activity. We're leveraging our experience from Gorgon and incorporating learnings into our ongoing activities. We expect Train 2 to start-up six to eight months following Train 1. Turning to Permian, we\u2019re making excellent progress. Last year we lowered unit development costs by 20% and lowered unit operating costs by 35% compared to 2015. We're improving recoveries and our results are validating expectations around improvements in type curves. We're currently running 10 company operated rigs and we're adding a new rig about every eight weeks. The story keeps getting better. We'll update this chart and provide much more information about our Permian operations at our Analyst Day in March. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind we actually have a very full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary and will do our best to get all of your question answered, thanks. Jonathan please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : Hi, good morning. I just want to start on the 2017 production guidance. If I look at that guidance maybe on an absolute volume basis at the midpoint it would be around 2.75 million barrels a day. And I know it is a little bit stale, but a couple of years ago you had talked about a 2.9 to 3.0 type of range and obviously a lot has changed from then to now. But I was hoping maybe you could help bridge some of those moving pieces between project timing, asset sales, P and Z effects and really just trying to think through ultimately after 2017 how much additional uplift to volumes there would be from projects. John Watson : Yes, it's a good question. If you go back to that time we did put out an estimate of 2.9 to 3 range and actually the results were shown - now are very consistent with a couple of exceptions. The first and obvious one is the Partitioned Zone. We were producing - we expected we'd be back up and operating and that's about 70,000 barrels a day. So that's a clear delta. The second is the effects of asset sales that we didn't anticipate at that time. If you add up what's already closed, you can get another 70,000 barrels a day pretty quickly. And so you put those two together and that's 150,000 barrels a day and that really explains it. Now as you point out, there are some other ups and downs notably, some delays in capital projects, but the flipside of that is we got benefits the shale and tight volume is growing, Jack St. Malo has performed better than we expected. We have some price, a little bit of benefit from price effects. But those about offset. So the two big items are really the partition zone and asset sales and you get kind of right back into the zone we talked about. Phil Gresh : Okay, got it. That is very helpful. And then the second question would just be on the longer-term CapEx budget. Looking at the bars that you gave for 2017, there's still $2 billion in there for Gorgon and Wheatstone and then another $2 billion plus it looks like just looking at the bars for projects that are outside of Tengiz. So I guess I was just wondering how you are thinking about that $17 billion to $22 billion range, especially as we look at 2018 and you potentially have a couple billion still rolling off. Are there a lot of projects in the queue that you think work in the mid-50s or how are you thinking about that now? John Watson : Yes, first, if I got back a year and you told me we would be able to get our spending, do all the work we did this year and have spending at $22.4 billion, I wouldn't have believed it. So we've made remarkable progress in bringing our cost down. I had my drilling guy in the other day and he gave me an examine, the wells we drilled in 2016 if we had had the productivity we had in 2014, we would have spent $1 billion more. So the drilling efficiencies that we have put in place and I was just in the deep water. So the efficiencies we put in place had allowed us to bring down cost. So the trend of spend is down and as you point out we have some major capital projects that are being completed. If we're still in the $50 to $55 world, you'll see us tracking at the bottom end of that range. Now we have -- we're showing a range out of 2020 that's a four-year period and so when we think out over that time period obviously a lot of things can change. Notably, I would expect that we would see an increase in unconventional spending. We talked about ramping up the Permian and I think that will be the case. We were budgeting about $2 billion this year, but you could easily see another $1 billion there. We have very little activity in the Marsalis now. I would -- we've gotten very efficient there. So we would expect better market conditions and an offtake capability there. We made good progress in the Duvernay, Argentina. So just in the shale and tight area, you could see some increases, but again that's short cycle, high return activity. Now we do have some opportunities in the portfolio that if we continue to make good progress on concepts and delineation drilling, things like Anchor and Tigris and we've highlighted Rosebank and a few others. So we have a good queue of projects, but we need to make sure that those have right economics associated with them, but all of that can comfortably fit in the range that we've talked about, but I'll just say that if where at $50 to $55, you should expect spending to go down next year. Thanks Phil. Phil Gresh : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Banc of America, Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You have normally talked about the base business and the tight unconventional business kind of in the same breath as one offsetting the declines in the other. So I guess my first question is, in the context of declining rates and maintenance spending, your budget this year puts that number about $8.5 billion. Is that how we should interpret Chevron's definition of maintenance CapEx on a go forward basis? At least for the portfolio as it stands today? John Watson : Yes, I think that if I understand the question, we've been trying to isolate the shale from the other base business activity, just because it's such a high profile activity. The fundamental nature of it has a lot of similarities with base business in the sense that it's relatively short cycle activity and it has to compete for capital with for example infill drilling in Bakersfield or Thailand or places like that. So I think that's the right way to look at it and that's why we talked about declines in the 2% to 3% range and despite the big drop in capital, we were able to maintain that sort of a decline rate, but I think that's the right way to look at it and I think we'll generally separate the shale from the base business, so that you have transparency in that way because you're right, when you put them both together you know if you lump them together it will mask what's going on in the underlying sort of conventional business. So if I understand your question right, I think the answer is yes. Doug Leggate : Okay, I appreciate that, John. That is what I was trying to get at. I guess my follow up is also in the Permian. I realize you probably want to hold some details for the Analyst Day, but just to kind of frame this. So Exxon has done the [BotCO] [ph] deal, they are talking about going to 15 rigs; my understanding is it's a fraction of that number today. You are talking about adding a rig every eight weeks, stepping up your spending and so on. Can you give us some idea, John, what is the strategic thinking here? Is there a real pivot away from large capital projects at least in the short term to work with Permian? And if that's the case, how big a piece of the portfolio would you like to see the Permian ultimately represent given things like dividend commitments and other portfolio decisions that you have? And I will leave it there. Thanks. John Watson : As told on Slide 15, we haven't updated since the last time we talked but we will update it, the next time that we see and if you - if my foreshadowing was any good, you know that it's likely to improve. So we have taken a different approach than some on the Permian. We've taken the approach of trying to delineate understand what we have and then put together plans that consider off-take, consider infrastructure and really get lined out so that we can steadily grow over the period consistent with generating good returns in this business. Now we told we've been able to bring our cost down but we will continue to ramp up. We talked about over next couple years getting up to 20 rigs but we're not limited per se, we're only limited by the good planning that we can do, the planning on infrastructure around a rig contracts, the quality of crude, frac spreads and other aspects of this so that we can move forward rapidly and we\u2019ll continue to do that. It's kind of interesting, we hear a lot about how rapidly others done but the facts are we only have five non-operated rigs running at the end of the year and we've been steadily going during the year and so there's a lot of up and down that other operators put in place. We want to do as we add rigs we want those rigs to be in service to us going forward we want to steady ramp up and not whipsawing our organization around. And so you'll see it steadily growing and I've told my group in the Permian that they are not capital limited, they just need to be sure that they are disciplined about their spend, that we get good returns on it, and that we properly evaluate the acreage. Just want to anecdote for you, the kind of getting the efficiency argument that might be of interest. We added to our resource base 500 million barrels this year in the Permian without spending any money. And we did that by watching what offset operators have done. So obviously these are continuous plays we were able - so we have been able to learn by being a little bit behind others we have been able to learn and that's help us to prioritize the stand that we're doing. So we will prosecute our agenda, you'll see the potential on growth profile rise. In an overall sense it wouldn't surprise me to see our unconventional activity be 25% of our production by the middle of the next decade. So this is a really solid asset class but it's one it's going to be driven by our ability to generate good returns and fit the proper role in the portfolio. Doug Leggate : Appreciate the answer. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Good morning, John, Pat, Frank. There has been some investor questions about Gorgon and Wheatstone timing especially with some of the choppiness around Train 1 in the fourth quarter. But it sounds like your messages, you think everything is tracking well here. Can you give us an up to date on what the confidence level is around construction execution at the assets and what the greatest risk to timing at Gorgon and Wheatstone ramp is? Frank Mount : Well Gorgon is done I guess would be the way I would describe the construction is completed on Train 3, Train 1 and 2 are operating near capacity in fact - the only remaining thing to do is to bring on the Gorgon offshore field. We've been running on the Jansz field and so we will fill out those plans 100% when the Gorgon field comes online shortly. So in terms of construction activity at Gorgon all is good. Now we do have - we do have to have an effective startup and commissioning process and we had some bumps on train one. We talked about that before, but I've been really pleased that the organization has taken all that in and addressed anything that might from that those learnings on train two and on train three. It's obviously been very effective on train two and I've got no reason to believe it won't be effective on train three, but a strong startup in commissioning is really key for Gorgon but my subtlety in my comments was we expect LNG early in the second quarter. So I think the story of Gorgon is a good one. At Wheatstone we're making good progress, certainly at the plant and I think the comment I made is the critical path activity is the offshore platform. Now the well worth subsea flowlines, pipelines umbilical, all that is complete. Train one construction is nearing completion and commission is underway and so the critical path activity is in some of the platform piping systems. They\u2019ve taken a little longer to complete and be commissioned. We've supplemented our workforce on the platform, but it hasn\u2019t changed our expectation of a midyear start date. But it's just the ongoing activity and ebb and flow in the construction work, but the plan is still for midyear startup of that plant, but the message I'm trying to give you is it's pretty good and as activity winds down, you can really focus on the work faces that are still open, high grading crews and so I expect you'll continue to see a good story coming out of this but it's obviously a little bit earlier in the process, so there's more work to do on Gorgon, but it's also progressing well. Neil Mehta : And shifting to policy, there is obviously a lot of changes under this new administration. One of the things that's caught a lot of investor attention is the border tax adjustment. John, what is your view on whether that is good policy and whether that has a meaningful impact on global oil prices in the refining business if it goes through. John Watson : Well Neil, I've seen what you published and others and I think you've assessed it reasonably well. Let me make a couple of comments. First, in an overall sense I've been very pleased with the agenda that the Trump administration has. We've seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade and putting a much, much more balanced cost-benefit framework in place to assess the value of those regulations freeing up infrastructure pipeline, all of that is quite positive for our business for the country job creation and a lot of things. So that is very much a positive and we all know that our tax system is not competitive. We want American companies to be able to compete and so there's a lot of work being done to try to bring down corporate rates so that we can compete both at home and abroad for capital and of course menstruation has a focus on bringing jobs and capital back to the U.S. and lower rate will help that. In my view, they're looking for pay-for, they're looking for ways to make those always happen and so they're looking at a variety of different concepts and the truth is, there are a lot of different ideas being floated right now and I think they're looking for input and we'll continue to provide it. President Trump has indicated that the border adjustment concept is complex and I would agree with that. And so I think we need to take a close look at perhaps the consequences of that both some of them could be positive and the unintended consequences in terms of impact on consumers, exchange rates and knock on effects on the global economy and I have no doubt that the anticipation will do a good job of doing that and will settle on the right kind of tax reform at the end of the day. But I think we need to have a little patience for the different ideas that are being put out there and hopefully we'll get to the right outcome. Thanks Neil. Neil Mehta : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. John, could you talk about OPEC this year and the impacts that you anticipate? My understanding was that Partitioned neutral Zone would be part of the cuts. But also I would be interested if you had observations on some of your other areas of exposure. And a couple of the more obscure ones would be obviously Venezuela and whether or not -- exactly where you are at in Nigeria right now. Thank you. John Watson : Sure. The short answer is I don't expect a significant impact from any of these things on our operations, certainly in Venezuela and Nigeria indications are they been operating at lower rates and we've had no indication that we're going to be impacted. When I look at the Partitioned Zone, and you look at the public comments that have been made by Kuwait, they have a strong desire to get the onshore Partitioned Zone where we - where that Saudis and Kuwaitis are partners and we represent the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have a strong desire to get that online and they have indicated that it won't have an impact on quarters. So to me the issues are between the two governments and if they can resolve those, we will be able to bring it back up and I think both countries have flexibility in terms of which fields they produce and where that volume will come from. We think those are high margin barrels when they come online. I mean if you look at the work during this time and we've been down there, our people have taken the time to dramatically reduce costs and they have taken a close look at the reservoir and we've got a queue of base business activity that is very high return, it will compete with the best we've got in the world and it's very economic. So I think the Kuwaitis understand that. And I think there's a desire to move it back to get it back on production but look this is - these are issues between governments, I'm not going to give you a forecast of when that might be resolved. Paul Sankey : Right, but on balance you are expecting little impact from OPEC. My follow up is on decline rates. John, you have talked in the past a lot about them. Have you been surprised by how little global oil supply has declined post 2014? But do you anticipate an acceleration in declines? Thank you. John Watson : It\u2019s a really good question Paul. I think the shorter answer is, I have been surprised at how resilient production has been in many locations around the world some of that is we just keep getting better. If you look at for example some of the Deepwater developments that we and others have, we've been on plateau at Agbami for a long time, we\u2019ve been in plateau in some of our Gulf of Mexico projects and I think we and others are getting very good at extending plateaus and technology only goes in one direction. We hear about in the context of the shale but the same thing is true in other conventional activity. So I think the short answer is, I have been little surprised and with the benefit from - for example in Russia from declining exchange rates and things of that sort, it's made some of that base activity more competitive. Ultimately however you do need new major capital projects to fill the gap if you look out a few years and we are not just seeing FID's been taken on significant new Greenfield opportunities and so at some point we do need - we do expect to see at least in the conventional area some declines in production and there is a limit to this and it has surprised us that it's held up as well as it has, but at some point you're going to need new activity. Paul Sankey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : John, I wanted to come back to the comment you made about 70% of capital spend having an effect on production within two years. Now I assume part of that is still spending on major capital projects that start in that time. But, nevertheless, it does illustrate how much you are shifting towards short cycle spend. And really the question is how has this changed how you manage the risk profile of the Company on a move forward basis? Thinking really about how you view uncertainty of earnings from the production profile by not having the big step changes necessarily being as impactful? And how you think about the balance sheet without having those big capital commitments? John Watson : I think it's true. There are - there are different kinds of risk when you think about it Deepwater development versus some of the base business activity or some of the shale development and so we're cognizant of that and I think that driven some of the comments you heard me and Pat make about how we look at the balance sheet. During the period of time in the early part of this decade, I was very clear going back to five years plus. We were heading into a period where we had significant major capital projects, we were going to keep some capacity on the balance sheet and so we had more cash than debt on the balance sheet. And so because we knew we were going to be drawing on that - drawing on the balance sheet. Now we didn\u2019t expect to see the drop in prices as big as we saw but it proved to be pretty wise to keep that capacity on the balance sheet. Now we're on a different period. We do have the Tengiz project but I don't see the same anything like Gorgon, Wheatstone or Tengiz in our future. We could see a deepwater development but none of these are of that same magnitude and with the drop in interest rates that we've seen during that period, debt is a very effective form of financing. And so we want to keep some capacity on the balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in and be in a good position to take advantage of opportunities, but you I think you'll see us carrying more debt on the balance sheet than we have in the past. We've talked in the 20% to 25% debt range and we think that balance is keeping some capacity and taken advantage of the low cost of debt. The key for us is having some financial flexibility around our capital spending that really reduces the execution risk and means you don't have to keep that as much capacity on the balance sheet. Jason Gammel : Can I ask one follow up, please? John Watson : Sure. Jason Gammel : Okay. I just wanted to -- I have two quick questions about what is included in the production guidance. If I look at the chart on page 10, if I take the net of the base decline and the base investment, it implies a mitigated decline rate of 1%. Could you tell me what factors into the guidance range and then also how the Partitioned Zone factors into the 4% to 9% guidance range. John Watson : Sure. I think if I understand the question, the base decline that we show by the red bar are kind of in the 2% to 3% range and we do have a range, the bottom of the production range in our estimate that we put forward, assumes that we get nothing from the Partitioned Zone this year. The top of the range assume it starts up about midyear or so. So those are the two variables and that's why we put the fuzzy bar and some brackets around it because I just can't -- I just can't handicap that perfectly, but the base decline is that 2% to 3% range. Jason Gammel : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please? Paul Cheng : Hey guys. Good morning. John, if we look at the industry it seems like you already bottom and the Company is in good shape, that projects are coming on stream and you should reach cash flow neutral not and it depends on the projects should be cash flow positive. So can we -- using this opportunity that you're already resizing your company also for this -- currently the lower oil prices. So, can we step a step back and maybe that you can tell us that how the next 5, 10 years how you want to position? What are the roadmaps that you have in mind? How do you want to differentiate yourself with the peers and the other international major corporations? Is it that everyone is now saying that oh I mean there is no differentiation, we're in commodity business and the big major IOC is really in a disadvantage on the business model? So, can you help us that to wrap it altogether now that you no longer -- not you necessarily, but for most other people that no longer is in the mode of survival, can we look a little bit further out, now can you afford that business to look at it and saying that give us what is the roadmap? John Watson : Sure. Well Paul look, it won't surprise you that I don't agree with some of those assessments. I think we're in a terrific position and some of the TSR data that we show even looking at independence over a period of time we look pretty good and I would say that we are differentiated from some of our competitors and let me see if I can describe why. We aren't integrated oil and gas company and we have shown a bias toward the upstream portfolio. We think over time, we can earn very strong returns and that we have competitive technology and assets to do just that. We do have a strong downstream and chemical business. It earns good returns. It has complementary activity that add value to some of our resources around the world as well as a lot of very talented people. So we will have a downstream and chemical business, but certainly we will be predominantly an upstream company and that in and of itself is a bit of a difference from some of our competitors. Within the upstream, I think we also differentiate ourselves by the quality of the assets that we have. There are risks to being a company that's only in one particular asset play regardless of how good that play is. We got a diverse portfolio for example if you look at our position in Australia, the resource base we have there will have five LNG trains plus a position in a six that's or a third project down there in the Northwest shelf. We have a very advantage manufacturing position and a lot of resource that can feed those facilities over time. So Australia is a terrific asset. Tengiz we have talked about. That distinguishes us from many of our competitors and the Permian is of course the emerging asset and we got a terrific position there that I think is the envy of a lot of others and you will see - you are seeing us and you'll see us in the future really get after that business. And I haven't even talked about the talent we have and the asset position we got in the deepwater and elsewhere. So we have a very good portfolio that I wouldn't trade with anybody and I think over time the diversity in that portfolio will show benefits and anyone asset has some risk associated with it from an industry perspective and I think we've got a position that second to none. Now our approach is going forward is to - we know we have to improve returns because in a lower price environment the financial returns haven't been what you and I would want them to be but if you look at the cost trends and efficiency trends we've got and - where we\u2019re putting on capital going forward as capital base roles over I think we've got some very strong assets so that going forward the assets that we got the investments that we\u2019ll able to make will earn good return. So I think all of those things distinguish us in what is - from a topline point of view a difficult time that we're emerging from and one that will not likely be the same $100 environment that that we saw a few years ago, maybe that's a long answer. Paul Cheng : Really great. Just a quick second one, Venezuela. Any insight to how bad is the industry - oil industry in the country at this point? And do you think that any systematic risk is likely? Or that if not, then do you think that the current production capacity actually will be able to hold relatively flat or will you going to continue to see this decline for the year? Frank Mount : Well for the most part I\u2019m going to comment on our operations and we've been able to navigate pretty well down there have good relationships in Venezuela but we've been able to maintain and we have a structure in place that is enabling us to continue work, enabling us to continue to invest and enabling importantly to enable the contractors, the tax authorities and ourselves to get paid. And so that seems to be working very well. What I point out is despite the - obviously the concerns about what's happening in the country right now and some difficulties there encountering, they have a huge resource base and Chevron is well respected there and I think there's an opportunity for us to play a very constructive role in Venezuela going forward certainly maintaining the existing assets that we have and potentially as time goes forward participating in other opportunities there but it's unquestionably difficult time thus far we've been able to manage it working well with the government. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Ed Westlake : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the margin improvement chart into 2017, that was very helpful. Obviously as you shift to short cycle and Permian you probably also get, plus with deflation, some benefits on the capital intensity side as well, which should lead, as you pointed out, to returns and free cash flow. You spoke about debt balances, but what about growth say over the next decade versus dividends, buybacks? I mean any philosophical changes there? John Watson : There aren't changes philosophically, but let me make a couple of comments because I am encouraged - you touched on cash flow, I am very encouraged by what I see going forward on cash flow. If you look at 2016 cash from operations in the 13 billion range but it's easy to see big chunks of improving in cash flow going forward. Capital spending, the cash C&E was 18.7 last year with 15.1 that's 3.5. Oil averaged $44 a barrel if it averages 55 our sensitivity is you know that that's another $3.5 billion. We made a capital contribution to TCO technically alone for $2 billion last year and didn't receive a dividend of consequence last year. So you could see another $3 million swing net out of TCO and that doesn't even count the Gorgon and Wheatstone. The fourth quarter had a once in five years shutdown of Richmond refinery that probably cost us $3 million. We had Agbami down for once in eight years that's a very profitable investment. We had record production at TCO last year despite one of the biggest shutdowns they've ever had that was done successfully. All these things are portending strong cash flow with the \u2013 obviously the underlying risk will have to be considered in price, but certainly the message going forward is good. So the prospect for us to improve earnings, improve free cash flow and increase the dividends are good and the priorities that you referred to really haven't changed. We want to increase the dividend as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. We need to continue to invest in the highest return opportunities and we are definitely high grading that, not funding everything that meets minimum hurdle rates and we need to do that and manage the balance sheet at the same time and it's something that Pat works very hard on and dividend policy ultimately is a purview of the Board but in speaking for them we just reviewed what our plans are going forward. I think we have a very good support for the Board from the full Board on this subject. So I think the outlook is good and I'll tell you four years ago I wouldn't have thought that would be the case at moderate prices. So I think it's a good story and we\u2019re going to continue in that direction. Ed Westlake : And then maybe a follow-up on the question on decline you spoke more globally. But as you think about the Chevron assets and the ability to keep the decline rate, [Atwater] [ph] has been a relatively low level over the past year. I mean, how long do you think that you can keep that up? I mean the Tengiz decline rate when that was announced did surprise a few folks. And so I am just wondering if there is any things that we should be concerned about as we forecast out over the next several years. John Watson : There's always a requirement to reinvest in the business. In the case of Tengiz, it\u2019s a technically complex field and so those needed pressure management equipment and we have to make those investments. That's very different from say Bakersfield California where there's infill drilling that you need to do but it's a pretty well understood phenomena. If you invest a certain amount of capital you can manage the decline. So I don't have the real \u2013 when we were early last year we were down around $30 a barrel and we weren\u2019t investing in the business and really we were cutting back activity in lots of areas. There was the potential for declines to accelerate because we just weren't drilling wells and we were I think it was very difficult time for everyone in the industry. But if we get back to a more normal level of activity you can see sort to 2% to 4% kind of declines that I think would be normal and the individual asset ultimately matures but -- I don\u2019t think I can give you a lot more general guidance than that. Frank Mount : Thanks Ed. Ed Westlake : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Yes, good morning. John, you should tweet your US policy and BAT response later. My question is on, you mentioned the Permian story keeps getting better with an ambitious 25% production potential in the middle of next decade. I mean as much as border tax, I think investors remain focused on service cost inflation here in the US. So any color or outlook there and how much inflation would it trigger -- would it take, sorry -- to trigger a capital reallocation away from the Delaware in your plan? Or how do you offset there as they maybe relate to continuing improvement in well performance and otherwise? John Watson : Yes, Evan, boy, that\u2019s a topic that gets a lot of attention and my view is I think if you look globally, there isn\u2019t a lot of pressure on the supply chain. I don\u2019t expect continuing reductions necessarily in market conditions. But there isn\u2019t a lot of upside pressure globally. In the Permian, activity has picked up and going forward we would expect to see some pressure but if you look at the dramatic reductions in cost that we've been able to achieve it's been mostly a function of efficiency measures that we think are sustainable. One of the reasons I made the comments I did earlier bouts about steady ramp up of rigs and having sort of a consistent and well thought through plan is it will be important to have consistency in workers for example. Not all rigs are the same so you want to have the best rigs, you want to have the best crews, you want to have consistent relationships with suppliers who want to be with you through thick and thin so that you can have that maintain that productivity that we\u2019ve worked so hard to put in place. Our view is despite some increases, potential for increases, we don't think it's going to make a material difference to us over the next couple of years and I\u2019ll confide it to that period, but we don't think it\u2019s going to make a big difference even if you should see some changes. I should also point out in areas like the deepwater our costs are going to come down because we've got deepwater rigs that are under contract at above market rates. We're going to be releasing a couple of rigs here literally over the next couple of weeks so we\u2019ll be down to four deepwater rigs. But over time all these rigs come off contracts and so when you think about the future of a deepwater development, the costs are coming down not going up. So there's some risk in isolated markets in areas but I think overall we\u2019ll be able to manage it. Evan Calio : No, we kind of agree Permian is a winner here. But my follow up is on the Permian and how big is your 2017 program either in rig or well terms? I'm just trying to understand how much of the 2017 CapEx is being spent on infrastructure, pad development or otherwise that is reflected in 2018 and beyond. It affects -- it would affect the model growth path. John Watson : We ended the year at 15 rigs, 10 operated, 5 non-operated and we\u2019re going to be ramping up over the course of this year, we expect up to 15 rigs operated by the end of the year with more on the non-operated side. We've got - our budget is about $2 billion there and look we expect to ramp up this year in the $50 to $60 range. We're going to continue to ramp up and I just want to say we want to do it efficiently. Frank Mount : Thanks Evan. Evan Calio : I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please. Alastair Syme : John, global LNG demand looked to have picked up a bit last year. Can you comment on the state of the market? And are you seeing any positive signs from your customers towards a willingness to turn new contracts in the market? John Watson : Yes, it\u2019s been interesting and it's been maybe a little surprising to some. We've had good demand for LNG. We were able to sign a couple of contracts last year. So that now Gorgon and Wheatstone sort of 85% maybe slightly more sold which is right about where we want to be. And if you look at where spot pricing have been it\u2019s clear that there's been incremental cargos going into China and Japan. So it's been somewhat encouraging I think and if you look at some of the environmental objectives they are particularly throughout Asia, it\u2019s actually some encouraging signs. Now I temper that with the understanding that we\u2019ve got projects that are coming online but the long-term trend for LNG demand is good because it's competitive on price in many locations and it certainly has desirable environmental characteristics and the security of that steady supply out of places like Australia it remains in demand. So by 2025 or so people are looking at demand increases that could be 65% or more. So it's a good story. I don't think we\u2019re yet at the place where you're going to see a lot of FID is taken on new projects but it's been encouraging to see a bump up in prices. Alastair Syme : As a follow-up John, are you having any sort of indicative marketing discussions around the Gorgon Train 4 or Kitimat or any of these projects? John Watson : Well we've had discussions over the years. I would say the most likely - you need to underpin a project like Kitimat with some type of contract and off take and I don\u2019t want to represent that we're very far along in those discussions. We\u2019ve been looking at different concepts for an LNG plant to be able to put one in more efficiently. We\u2019re proving up the resource side which is encouraging up in the Liard and Horn River area and of course we've done some work on pipeline. But I don\u2019t want to advertise, that's moving real quickly primarily because of the economic side. When it comes to Gorgon, I think the first thing that you\u2019ll see at Gorgon is first we got the three trains lined down and operating smoothly and I think that will happen then you'll see the potential for debottlenecking and re-rating of those. And I think those are probably in the queue, certainly in the queue ahead of a Train 4 or other trains at Wheatstone for that matter where the same sort of principles will apply. We want to really get the most we can out of the year and hardware that we have and then contingent on market. We have a strong resource base there. We\u2019ll contemplate additional development. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Hello, good morning. I guess a quick question for you, Pat, just to come back to the comment about the -- kind of the other expense in the quarter. You said it wasn't ratable. Was there anything in there that is likely to reverse next year or that you can think of that we should expect next year in terms of higher taxes or unusual payments Pat Yarrington : Yes. So I think it\u2019s a good question. I wouldn\u2019t say that there is anything necessarily that\u2019s going to reverse. An example that you might not have thought of, when we have as many retirements as we have had for example, out of the U.S. John referenced, over the current year we have 5,200 pure employees this year and over the last couple of years it\u2019s about 9,500. For example, if you look at the U.S. we're slightly under funded on our pension and now those retirements occurs and of course you need to accelerate the recognition of that pension settlement cost. So, that\u2019s an example of what's sitting there in that corporate and other sector. And since we anticipate moderating, certainly we\u2019re not going to have the same kind of employee reduction, that kind of thing will moderate going forward. There is a fair amount of lumpiness just on a tax sense, where we continually every quarter go through and make assessments of our outstanding positions and make the appropriate bookings that are required there and I can\u2019t say that there is any pattern to that necessarily. As you look forward into 2017 though. I would say the one thing that probably is going to continue to grow would be our interest expense. Because our debt balances are higher. So we have had a guidance range of the $350 million to $400 million is probably towards the high end of that range probably you want to think in your mind around $400 million for each quarter for 2017. Roger Read : Okay, great, thanks. And then, John, maybe following up on Alastair's question but stepping out a little broader on FIDs. Is there, and I recognized the Analyst Day, that it might be more detailed coming then. But as you think about kind of moving into the offshore, are costs down enough now, are prices high enough and the returns attractive enough we should expect something in 2017? Or is it still maybe more patience and waiting John Watson : I think most of the money that we'll be spending in fact the four deep water rigs I mentioned will be developing drilling. I think it\u2019s a bit early to think about FID on something on Anchor and Tigris. We\u2019re just completing a couple of appraisal well if you will. We need to evaluate those. We're looking a different concepts for example in the deepwater there is technology that needs to be qualified there to be sure that it move them along we got industry groups that are working with vendors and suppliers to try to take cost out so I would say its work-in-progress, there is plenty of work to do that I would call brownfield activity you know off of existing facilities and so that\u2019s where most of the money will be spend. We talk previously about Rosebank and I would just tell you Rosebank, Anchor, Tigris, all are potential FIDs but we just have to get the cost resource development balance right and so I wouldn\u2019t think any of those big ones where we likely to see and FID in 2017. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons and Company. Your question please. Guy Baber : Good morning everybody. I just wanted to follow up on the cash margin discussion a little bit more and slide 12 where you highlight that improvement. But you introduced a slide I believe around a year ago that highlighted cash margins in 2017 at about $20 a barrel at $60 a barrel oil. But since then over the last year I believe your cost reductions have been more successful than anticipated, some lower margin barrels have come out at the portfolio and the Permian is looking better. So, can you just help us to understand how your view on those 2017 cash margins has maybe evolved over the last year or so? And is it reasonable for us to think that those margins could be higher at the same price. John Watson : Yes, we put this chart in thereto kind abate you a little bit and to watch your appetite and I think we successfully did that and I think all the things you point to are or what we were trying to get at. I am going to push off a little bit though and tell you that Jay Johnson will talk more about what we see in cash margins in our portfolio. With the cost improvements you are seeing the place of portfolio actions that we're taking, we'll update you little bit more to SAM guys. It's a really good question and I think it's one of our strengths and one of our good stories. But I'll push off to the SAM in five weeks or so. Guy Baber : Okay, understood. And then the follow up for me, I thought your reserve additions and the replacement metrics were pretty favorable overall in light of the environment. Could you perhaps share with us the early view on F&D costs this year? And then given F&D can be lumpy in any year and the cost deflation you have seen, your shift to prioritizing short cycle brownfield, do you have a view on maybe the new normal of F&D for your business going forward to 2020? John Watson : Well I agree with you that the reserve replacement numbers are pretty good, I'll tell you, if I go back to beginning of the year we weren't expecting to be near 100%, so a lot of the work that the people on our business units did, we got them focused on shorter cycle activity and it's an excellent work in terms of characterizing reservoir seismic work and others to enable us to appropriately book reserve. So you're right, we had a good year and particularly given that we understand dramatically relative to plan. So all that is - all that is good. F&D cost if you think the oil and gas disclosure can be really lumpy and you really have to look at and averaging over time. We've tended to give you development cost on a project-by-project basis. It doesn't always line up exactly with - the proved reserves bookings that tend to be how things are viewed in the oil and gas disclosure. So I won't make comments on what will appear on the oil and gas disclosure because that's a very specific set of calculations. But I think as we look forward to the security announcement we are going to have in a few weeks, I think Jay will be able to talk a little bit more about progress in the Permian and what we're seeing in some of our - what we're doing on deepwater and other asset classes to give you better idea of what development cost for any of those might be. So, we'll give you more. It's a real good question, but we need more time to talk about when I got here today. Guy Baber : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please. Anish Kapadia : Thank you. My first question is - correct me if I am wrong, but Chevron seems like it will be free cash flow positive in 2017 after dividends around current oil prices. And then if you factor in disposals certainly at the top end of the range, you are going to generate some significant excess cash flow. So I was wondering if you could talk about the priorities for the use of that excess cash flow this year. John Watson : Well, sure the expectation is to be cash flow positive with between all those things you mentioned, the ongoing improvement, finishing capital projects, lower spending, some assets sale proceeds et cetera. We do expect to be cash-flow positive. The priority on the dividend is that we said we'll increase the dividend as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. So we'll take stock of it, the board take stock of it. Every quarter we make a look and we'll increase it as we find appropriate. I guess the one point I'm trying to make is we're very cognizant that we've increased the dividend 29 years in a row and I view that any increase in the dividend would be something I want to be able to sustain in perpetuity. So going in that would be my expectation. So we always want to increase the dividend in a way that we can sustain over a period of time. So we will - we've given you the guidance on capital, I don't expect us to exceed the capital numbers that we have certainly. We are cognizant of the dividend policy and we are going to maintain the strong balance sheet. But I am not going to give you a specific guidance on the dividend at this time other than to say I am acutely aware of how much we all like dividends and so is the board. Anish Kapadia : Thank you. And a follow up going back to the Permian again. Just to kind of think of it bigger picture. I was just wondering how important is it for you -- is it to you for the market to recognize the value of your Permian acreage? And if it is important how do you get the market to recognize that? And I am kind of thinking of it in the terms of you can easily bring value forward by running a lot more rigs on the acreage or disposing of some of your acreage that I suppose you -- given the huge inventory you might not be drilling for 20, 30 years. So just how do you balance managing the asset versus kind of showing the value to the market? John Watson : It\u2019s very important for us to have value realized in a reasonable period of time. And there is no intention to warehouse acreage that we are not to going to get to. In fact, if you look at the asset disposal we have, we've been high grading our portfolio very steadily. What I don't want to do, is dispose a acreage prematurely before we've been able to assess it fully. If we have followed what some wanted us to do, we would have sold things a couple of years ago that are now worth five times what they are. So we continue to assess it. If we find that there is acreage in the portfolio that we\u2019re not going to get to for a long period of time, I am more than happy to monetize it. But that is not the way we think that we can realize most value. And I will just make a minor editorial comment. There are lot of people with ulterior motives out there when it comes to disposal of assets and we are prosecuting our agenda across our competitive and we will utilize our acreage and expose that value to shareholders in a way that will give them confidence that value will be realized from it. That is and we recognize that we do continue to get more information and provide that so that you have that confidence. So, it's a very fair question and it\u2019s on us to do that and you\u2019ll see a lot more in March. Anish Kapadia : Okay. Very clear, thank you John Watson : I think we have one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please. Blake Fernandez : Thanks for squeezing me in. Back on the deepwater, Roger's question, Mad Dog was noticeably absent and your partner and the operator has announced sanctioning there. Unless I missed it I don't believe we have heard from Chevron. So you can talk about that and whether that's in the 2017 budget. John Watson : Yes, in a word, it is. Blake Fernandez : Okay. John Watson : We have a relatively small interest. We're not the operator, but yes, we work with the operator. We\u2019ve been able to get cost down. They\u2019ve taken FID. We have not yet taken FID, but I expect that we will. Blake Fernandez : Great. Okay. And the second question, Pat, this may be for you. But you mentioned about $4 billion of deferred tax. And I assume that that begins to be a net positive once the US Upstream is net income positive, which it was this quarter. So is it fair to think that that is kind of a cash contributor into next year or this year I should say? Pat Yarrington : I think it will be a cash contributor a partial cash contributor in 2017, yes. Because we have the ability in the U.S. to take some the tax losses and carry them back to earlier periods where we have taxable income. And depending upon what happens to prices and how we operate U.S. both upstream and downstream, we will get a schedule of repayments over time. Blake Fernandez : Thank you very much. Frank Mount : Okay. We went a little longer. I wanted to get as many of you in as I could. Thank you for your time today. We appreciate your interest in the company. We look forward to talking you again in March and until then, we\u2019ll continue to prosecute our agenda. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Steve Green, President, Chevron Asia-Pacific Exploration & Production company. Also joining us on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. I'll begin with a discussion of first quarter 2017 results. Steve will provide an update on upstream activities, with an emphasis on the portfolio he leads in the Asia-Pacific region. Then I'll conclude with a recap of key messages from our March 2017 security analyst meeting. Turning to slide 3, an overview of our financial performance, the company's first quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, earnings for the quarter totaled $2.3 billion or $1.23 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $3.9 billion and included about $1 billion in working capital consumption. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. At quarter end, debt balances stood at $45 billion, approximately $900 million lower than where we ended 2016. On a headline basis, this means a debt ratio of approximately 24%. On a net debt basis, our debt net of cash totaled $38 billion. Our debt ratio stood at approximately 20%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4%. Turning to slide 4, we intend to be cash balanced in 2017 at $50 Brent prices, and this slide demonstrates that we are nicely on our way to delivering that. First quarter 2017 net cash generation of $900 million incorporates the impacts of growing operating cash flow, reduced capital spend, and proceeds from asset sales. Operating cash flow reflects improved realizations and high-margin volume growth. Deferred tax effects were approximately $600 million, and affiliate earnings exceeded affiliate dividends by approximately $700 million. TCO did not pay a dividend during the first quarter. That is more likely a second half event. Additionally, working capital requirements consumed approximately $1 billion in the quarter. If you look back over several years, you will generally see a pattern of working capital consumption in the first quarter and often the second quarter resulting from the timing of tax and variable compensation payments as well as inventory build. The historical pattern also shows reversal in the second half of the year, and we expect that reversal pattern to hold again this year. Cash capital spend for the quarter was $3.3 billion, approximately $2.3 billion or 40% less than the first quarter of 2016. Reductions come mainly from finishing our major capital projects under construction, pacing and high-grading future investments, and realizing efficiency gains along with higher cost reductions. First quarter asset sale proceeds were $2.1 billion, primarily from the sale of our geothermal assets in Indonesia. Turning now to slide 5, here you see current quarter earnings compared against the same period last year. First quarter 2017 results were $3.4 billion higher than first quarter 2016 results. Special items, primarily a gain from the sale of our Indonesian geothermal assets, increased earnings by $795 million between periods. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased $2.3 billion between periods. This reflected improved realizations, lower operating expenses, and increased volumes. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by approximately $80 million, mostly due to the swing in timing effects and lower operating expenses. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower employee expenses and favorable corporate tax items. As we've indicated previously, our guidance for the other segment is $1.6 billion in annual net charges, so quarterly results are likely to be non-ratable. Turning to slide 6, I'll now compare results for the first quarter of 2017 with the fourth quarter of 2016. First quarter results were approximately $2.3 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Special items, mainly from a gain on the sale of geothermal assets in Indonesia, increased earnings between periods by $600 million, while foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $267 million between periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $267 million between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange were higher by $668 million, reflecting the absence of the impacts of the fourth quarter Richmond refinery turnaround and a swing in timing effects. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges and a swing in corporate tax items between quarters. Turning to slide 7, this chart shows first quarter production growth of 82,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or more than 3% from full-year 2016 levels. Startups and ramp-ups, primarily from Gorgon, Angola LNG, and Alder as well as growth in our Permian assets support accelerated production through the quarter. Base declines, the impact of production sharing and variable royalty contracts, along with the 2017 impact of asset sales consummated in 2016, reduced production. Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we expect to see additional growth from Gorgon Train 3, the first train at Wheatstone, and Sonam. Additionally, we expect to see continued ramp-ups from other MCPs such as Mafumeira Sul and Moho Nord as well as growth in our Permian assets. Ultimate production growth for 2017 will be impacted by uncertainties, such as the timing and speed of MCP startups and ramp-ups, external events such as the Partition Zone restart, and base decline rates. Price and spend levels will also impact the amount of cost recovery barrels we receive. All said, we expect to comfortably be within the 4% to 9% growth range we provided earlier in the year, again before asset sales. Our current estimate for the impact of 2017 asset sales on production continues to be a reduction of 50,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our assets in Bangladesh, which produced approximately 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. The annualized impact of this and other asset sales will be dependent upon the timing of this close and of other individual transactions. And now Steve will walk us through some upstream updates. Stephen W. Green: Thanks Pat. Good morning. Turning to slide 8, all three trains at Gorgon are operational making LNG and in aggregate running over 85% of nameplate capacity, processing gas from both the Jansz and Gorgon fields. The Gorgon project is currently loading a ship about every two days and has shipped 67 cargoes to date, with 38 cargoes shipped since the beginning of the year. Cargo 68 is currently loading now. Recent highlights include we maintained domestic gas production of about 130 million cubic feet per day through the quarter. The Gorgon offshore field started up mid-February. Trains 1 and 2 operated reliably near capacity, with first quarter net LNG production of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Train 3 started up mid-March, a month ahead of schedule, and very much like Train 2, above expectations on ramp-up and approached nameplate capacity within two weeks We recently completed a shutdown of Train 2. The shutdown was planned to address a reliability issue previously identified and resolved on Train 1 and on Train 3 prior to startup. Once all three trains are at nameplate capacity, our share of Gorgon production will be over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking ahead, we'll complete commissioning and startup of additional equipment which boosts efficiency of the trains such as the turbo expanders and the end flash gas compressors, systems that can be started now that all three trains are operational. Once all systems are in operation, we can begin the optimization and tuning of each train, the first step in further increasing capacity. After this, we'll analyze plant performance and look for debottlenecking opportunities that'll increase capacity and capture incremental value going forward. Turning to slide 9, at Wheatstone, the physical construction of all systems required to commence Train 1 startup is complete, and our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Presently, we're focused on commissioning a range of systems as we move toward first gas and have begun running and testing the compressors. We've achieved permanent power at both the onshore and offshore facilities. We're also progressing activities such as mechanical, electrical, and instrument tests as well as final integrity inspections. Within Chevron, we're leveraging our experience locally from Gorgon and more broadly from Angola LNG, which has been operating steadily since the beginning of this year. We're also working closely with our partner, Woodside, which operates several LNG projects. We're preparing for a strong startup, recognizing it is still the first train of a new facility. We anticipate Train 2 startup about 6 to 8 months after Train 1. Turning to slide 10, a primary strength of our portfolio is our base business, where we generate value and cash flow through a disciplined approach. Capturing incremental value in base business is not new to us. We've been doing it for decades. During my time in Thailand, we continuously reinvented ourselves and increased efficiency. We planned our work to avoid stranding capital by bringing wells online timed to meet contractual obligations and market opportunities. This pattern continues today. This chart provides an example from our Thailand E&P business, where we drill over 500 wells per year and have net production of 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We've seen a substantial reduction in unit development and operating cost through well planning and execution. We've applied these best practices across the company and are seeing benefits in places such as San Joaquin Valley, Indonesia, and the Permian. We're also leveraging our installed capacity and our technological capability to generate value. An example comes from Agbami, where we've drilled and tied back 36 wells since 2005, which have kept the FPSO full. Another example is the 27-mile Lianzi tieback to an existing host in deepwater West Africa, where technology unlocked the opportunity to produce from a remote satellite reservoir. We have an integrated operations center in many of our core assets, where we create collaborative environments for cross-functional teams to analyze asset performance data and to make better intervention decisions. These centers are low-cost and consistently generate value. At TCO, it's helped achieve and sustain record production levels, with a focus on reliability and continued optimization of the well portfolio. We also have an integrated operations center in the Permian, which we expect will help us increase reliability and drive efficiency as our activity levels and production grows. Turning to slide 11, in the Permian, we continue to meet if not exceed expectations. The chart on the left shows our first quarter 2017 production of approximately 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the first quarter 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compound annual growth rate of 20% to 35%, and we're currently well within that range. We're standing up our 12th rig, and our plan is to continue to add rigs at this pace, achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we'll see our share of production from 13 gross non-operated rigs. We continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance, and we're incorporating the learnings into our forward plans. We intend to realize value through accelerated development and deliberate portfolio actions from the 150,000 to 200,000 acres we have identified as candidates for swaps, leases, or sales. Our objective in the Permian is to be fully competitive on our unit development and production cost and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance. With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thanks, Steve. Now turning to slide 12, we continue to lower our cost structure and reduce our spend. The chart shows a steep reduction in quarterly average C&E since 2014. Year-to-date capital expenditures of $4.4 billion are down 22% compared to the average 2016 quarter and down 56% compared to the average 2014 quarter. We are trending below annual guidance. We previously communicated that our capital guidance range is $17 billion to $22 billion per year through 2020. If oil prices remain near the $50 per barrel mark, you can expect to see our future spend near the bottom of this range. Year-to-date operating expense is down almost 11% when compared to the average 2016 quarter and down 26% when compared to the average 2014 quarter. We have made substantial progress on lowering our cost structure, and we are striving to have the remaining quarters of 2017 broadly continue this pattern. Now on slide 13, we received approximately $2.1 billion in asset sale proceeds in the quarter, the vast majority of which related to the sale of our geothermal assets in Indonesia. Since the beginning of 2016, we've sold approximately $5 billion in assets, and thus have already achieved the lower band of our targeted two-year range. Also during the quarter, we signed sales and purchase agreements to sell our marketing and refining assets in British Columbia and Alberta as well as our downstream business in South Africa and Botswana. These in-progress transactions are subject to regulatory reviews prior to closing, hopefully later this year. Additionally, we announced an agreement to sell our upstream assets in Bangladesh, a business where gas production is sold into the domestic market at a fixed price. Turning now to slide 14, I'd like to close by reiterating our messages from our recent security analyst meeting. Our financial priorities are clear and consistent. Our number one priority is to maintain and grow the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. To do that, we're focused on three areas. First, we are taking actions that should enable us to be cash balanced in 2017. We intend to continue to grow free cash flow thereafter. The first quarter was a good start. Second, we are focused on improving returns. This will happen as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volume. It will happen as we shift our capital program. 75% of our spend is expected to generate cash within two years, and it will be aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in how we manage our major capital projects. Third, we're focused on unlocking value from our entire portfolio. Our portfolio is anchored by legacy positions and advantaged by assets that are early in life. This gives us the opportunity to realize efficiency, reliability, and debottlenecking gains with short-cycle high-return capital investments. So that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please go ahead and open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question, please. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much and hi, everyone. I'd like to take advantage of Steve being on the call and ask a couple questions about Australia, if I could. Steve, you referenced in your remarks that Gorgon was currently operating at about 85%. I think each of the trains individually has been able to run at its nameplate capacity. Could you talk about anything that's on the critical path for all three trains being able to operate at nameplate capacity simultaneously and essentially what needs to be done before you can reach full economic capacity at Gorgon? Stephen W. Green: Sure, Jason. Thanks for the question. We have operated all three trains at or near capacity, and we're seeing good performance from all three trains. There's nothing that is prohibiting us from operating at nameplate capacity except the fact that we have to work through a methodical startup and again bring on the proper blend from gas from Jansz and Gorgon. In my prepared remarks, I referenced there's some additional equipment that we will now commission since all three trains are operating that will allow us to, again, boost capacity and continue working toward nameplate capacity. But all three trains have operated very reliably. They're operating reliably now. The Train 2 shutdown was a planned event to address a mechanical device that we knew we were going to. So we're looking forward now to a reliable period of operation that allows us to do some tuning and performance improvements. Jason Gammel : Okay, very clear. And then maybe as a follow up, I did note in the media that there was an unfavorable tax ruling recently in Australia that I think was related to interest deduction on some intercompany loans for some prior-year tax returns. I think the number was about $250 million that was referenced. I just wanted to check and see if there was any further potential liability on any past tax returns related to this issue and if there's anything prospectively that you think will affect your tax position in Australia. Patricia E. Yarrington: So, Jason, I'm going to go ahead and take that one, and I guess I want to start with expressing our huge disappointment in the ruling. I want to make it clear to everybody though that the courts affirmed that the financing arrangements that we had in place are legal. And so the issue that is being litigated here is the appropriate interest rate for a loan between our corporate group and our Chevron Australia subsidiary. I would say that the court ruling deviates substantially from recognized international transfer pricing guidelines. And in those guidelines, the courts are to treat related parties to a transaction as if they were standalone separate legal entities. And the Australian appellate court really failed to do this, so in other words they were making no distinction between the creditworthiness of the Chevron Corporation as an entity versus Chevron Australia as an entity, and therefore no distinction on the relative borrowing costs between those entities. I'd say that there's an awful lot at stake with this ruling, not just for Chevron but for any intercompany lending in Australia and more broadly around the globe, because it fundamentally changes established transfer pricing guidelines and principles. So if the ruling stands, it certainly going to affect any future investment in Australia. And I would say going forward and thinking about it specific to the Chevron case, we're obviously evaluating the decision. Now the decision just came out a week ago. It's a fairly lengthy decision, and we're reviewing our options. Those options include going forward with an appeal to the High Court of Australia as well as continuing on with discussions with the ATO on possible settlements and any other reasonable resolution to the dispute. Jason Gammel : Thanks, Pat, very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays, your question, please. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Steve, I had two questions. First, you mentioned that the Train 2 is done. So when's that supposed to come back? And I presume that you already \u2013 what happened is the mechanical issue you already addressing in Train 3 and Wheatstone. And also for Gorgon Train 4 and also Wheatstone Train 3, what kind of precondition do you need in order that you even consider an FID at this moment? Stephen W. Green: Sure. Thanks, Paul. With respect to Train 2, it is online and operating and producing LNG this morning. And as I mentioned, a little more color than in my prepared remarks, the issue that we addressed on the recent Train 2 shutdown was a mechanical device that's part of the flow measurement apparatus that we had previously dealt with in Train 1 and we corrected in Train 3 prior to Train 3 even starting up. Certainly, we are transferring all the learnings and experience from Gorgon to the Wheatstone project, so that prior to startup they have the opportunity to intervene and address those known issues prior to startup. As far as expansion trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone, there are a lot of factors that go into that. Our first priority is to get these assets up, stable, working as intended, and capture the value from the investment we've made. At that point then, it will be that decision, like any major capital project, will be a function of the market and the market's appetite for it and how those individual investments will compete in our portfolio at the time we FID them. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research, your question, please. Paul Sankey : Hi, everyone. Pat, you mentioned TCO no dividend. Could you just remind us? I think that you had said that at $50 Brent, below $50 you have to contribute to the capital expenditure programs there, above it's self-financing. I was just wondering what the sensitivity is on the dividend as regards to the oil price and whether I've got about the right numbers there. Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: Actually, Paul, what happened was that in 2016, we and Exxon made co-loans into the joint venture. There was also a third-party borrowing. And a summation of that, when you looked at the amount of funds that came into the enterprise relative to the amount of investment that was going to be required on the capital project, there were sufficient funds projected out for 2017 where there would not be another co-lending requirement needed for 2017. As you look forward in 2018 and if you assume a $50-ish scenario, there will more likely than not be co-loans going on in 2018 \u2013 2019. Somewhere in the $2 billion to $3 billion-ish range is our requirement for total affiliate spending over this period of time. So what we were saying is that because there was an advance funding of capital requirements in 2016, we didn't see that we would need to co-lend again in 2017. We do anticipate that there will be a dividend receipt in the second half of this year for us. Paul Sankey : That would be around oil prices? Sorry. Patricia E. Yarrington: That's exactly right, that's exactly right. And going forward, there will be obviously a lot of planning around what is the pace of spending on the project, what's happening to oil prices, what's the internal cash generation at TCO, et cetera. Paul Sankey : Great, thanks, Pat. And then the follow-up is your volume target for this year of 4% to 9% growth is a pretty big range. When I look at the uncertainties that you've listed, you seem to be saying that Gorgon/Wheatstone are bang-on schedule as far as you're concerned. I'll give you the Partition Neutral Zone uncertainty. I understand that one. I would have thought the base decline was fairly predictable by the time we're in April, and I don't really understand why there would be a PSC [Production Sharing Contract] effect if you were assuming $50 oil. Is it safe to say that we should be looking towards the higher end of that range because of the uncertainties apart from the Partition Neutral Zone are essentially being significantly mitigated? Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: I think what we were trying to do in addition to PZ, PZ is a significant component there, but we're also trying to say that even \u2013 what people capture in their mind is the 4% to 9%, and they forget the pricing premise that was used for it. And so yes, there are price sensitivities built into that range that influence cost recovery barrels and the like. Also, the investment levels going forward influence the cost recovery barrels as well. So we were just trying to be as descriptive as we possibly could be in naming the things that could either work to the upside or work to the downside. Paul Sankey : I guess my point is that it feels like the downside effects are significantly mitigated. Patricia E. Yarrington: If we continue on with first quarter results into second quarter and third quarter results, I would agree with you. Paul Sankey : Thanks, Pat. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, your question, please. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Frank Mount : Hi, Neil. Neil Mehta : Hey, how are you guys? First question relates to CapEx. It looks like you're tracking below the guidance, and I wanted to confirm, Pat. The $17 billion to $22 billion, it sounds like you're going to be on the lower end of that range at $50 a barrel Brent. And relative to the guidance, what surprised to the downside here as it relates to CapEx? Patricia E. Yarrington: I think that we are trending lower than a ratable amount would give you relative to our $19.8 billion target for this year. The affiliate spending was a little bit lower than ratable. And I think as you go through the year, there will be spending by TCO in particular that should pick up as the remaining three quarters get underway. Other than that, I would just speak to capital efficiency. I think we are getting much more output \u2013 much greater activity for a given dollar spend than we were anticipating. So coming in at the lower end of \u2013 coming in below the $19.8 billion could very well be where we end up for the year. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that. And, Pat, corporate costs were a little funky this quarter, favorable after being unfavorable last quarter. Can you talk about some of the drivers that contributed to that benefit? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, it's my favorite topic. Actually, all I would say is that the corporate sector can be really quite volatile. It does include certain corporate expenses, for example, related to employees. I mentioned last quarter, if you'll recall, about pension settlement costs. That's a factor that goes on in here. But more impactful typically would be corporate consolidated tax entries, and those are just very hard for us to predict. They're not necessarily ratable, and that's really what you see going on here in this particular quarter. I would just again ask you to go back and think about the full year and use the $1.6 billion net charge for that sector for us in your predictions. That's the best information that I have, and it will be not ratable. It will be lumpy. Neil Mehta : That's great. Thanks, Pat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America, your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thanks, good morning, everybody. Good morning, Pat. Pat, disposals, you made the point that you've already hit the low end of your range. There is some speculation that there could be additional asset sales that you haven't yet put in the public domain, Canada oil sands being the case in point. I'm just wondering if you could frame what the objective is. Is it to achieve the $5 billion to $10 billion, or is it to high-grade the portfolio? And what I'm really getting at is, if there were other things to sell, would you cap the sales at $10 billion, or would you keep going as you upgrade the portfolio? And I've got a follow-up, please. Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. So I don't think it's an either/or circumstance. We do want to come in between the $5 billion to $10 billion, but we also are very focused on improving the portfolio and high-grading the portfolio. So we put this target out a year and a half ago or so now, and we're in the second half of the time period in executing it. I think it's still a good target for us this year, but we will continue to look at the portfolio and continue to see if there are assets that again, either aren't strategic or not closely strategic, whether there's value that others see in it that's greater than ours or that won't attract capital in our capital allocation process. Doug Leggate : Can you address Canada specifically? Patricia E. Yarrington: Canada, it's a good asset for us. It's a cash generator for us. We're obviously aware of \u2013 you're talking about oil sands. I'm talking about oil sands at least. Doug Leggate : Yeah, I am. Patricia E. Yarrington: We're aware of the transactions that have occurred in this space over the last few weeks. All I would say is that if we were to transact, we'd want to make sure we got good value for it. Doug Leggate : My follow-up, Pat, hopefully a quick one. At the Analyst Day, you talked about evaluating a case to add an additional 10 rigs after the 20 rigs in the end of 2018. I'm just wondering, with CapEx trending below target, I know it's really early days. I get that. But I'm just wondering where you are in that evaluation, whether the pace might accelerate faster than you're currently guiding, and I'll leave it there. Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: Really I hate to \u2013 Doug, I hate to go off of guidance we gave just four weeks ago or so. It clearly is in our quiver here. We are obviously very much evaluating it. We're seeing great efficiency in terms of what we get per dollar spent. All of the production and operating cost improvements that we noted before continue to happen. So we very well may be able to capture much greater activity and therefore much greater volume per dollar spent. So we'll continue to look at this. We understand the \u2013 we have the same desire that our shareholders have, which is monetizing that asset as best we can, and this is certainly one avenue for doing that. Doug Leggate : Appreciate that, Pat. Good weekend, everyone. Patricia E. Yarrington: Thanks. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, your question, please. Philip M. Gresh: Hey, good morning, just one additional follow-up on Gorgon, I guess Wheatstone as well. With the production that we saw in the first quarter and where you're running today and then assumed startup cost for Wheatstone, how are you thinking about the real cash flow contribution from these two assets in 2017? I know they're meant to be a big contributor in the long term. But with the startup costs for Wheatstone and Gorgon finally just hitting its full stride, how much of that long-term cash flow contribution do you actually expect this year? Patricia E. Yarrington: I would say from a Gorgon standpoint, a reasonable number to have in your mind is a couple billion dollars. And of course, Wheatstone is just going to be ramping up, so I wouldn't expect a significant contribution there. Philip M. Gresh: Would you expect it to actually be a negative with the startup? Patricia E. Yarrington: I don't think I want to give a number there necessarily. There are still capital expenditures that are being incurred. And so if you look at it including capital expenditures, the answer on that would obviously be yes. It's probably a net drain on us. Philip M. Gresh: Understood. My follow-up is just... Patricia E. Yarrington: For 2016 (36:35). Philip M. Gresh: Yes, okay, got it. My follow-up is just on your supplement. The other production bucket for nat-gas has been up significantly. I assume that's Angola. You touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks. But maybe, Steve, if you could just highlight a little bit more for us where you're at with Angola and what you're expecting for the year. Stephen W. Green: Well, as you know, Angola restarted early part of the year, and it's been running very reliably since that time. And we are consistently loading LNG cargoes, propane cargoes, butane, and we expect that performance to continue. We've gotten the plant where we want it now and it's operating reliably. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil. Philip M. Gresh: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your question, please. Evan Calio : Hey. Good morning, guys. Frank Mount : Hi, Evan. Evan Calio : Pat, you mentioned that CapEx runs to a low end for 2017 if oil is near $50. Oil being near $50, can you discuss when you begin to adjust that spending? And is that adjustment within short-cycle Permian or elsewhere, just how that plays out in the 2017 capital program? Patricia E. Yarrington: I would just say within upstream, I think there is fine-tuning as the year progresses about where capital opportunities are being generated \u2013 additional spending opportunities are being generated. Obviously, the Permian is going to be one of the first places to draw additional capital, but there are other short-cycle investments, for example, in Thailand and also in San Joaquin that would also be attractive as well. So that is a routine optimization that goes on within the upstream leadership team \u2013 I won't say on a monthly basis, but obviously they continue to monitor that as the year progresses. Evan Calio : Right. So that works for lowering CapEx as well? I think you phrased it for raising CapEx. Patricia E. Yarrington: I did phrase it for lowering it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I meant... Evan Calio : Perfect, sure. My second question, I know, for Paul, I know a lot's been covered here within Australia. I know you have a lot of moving pieces in the portfolio that are outside of Chevron's control. Maybe just some update of conditions to outlook in Nigeria, Venezuela, and PNZ, any update in those regions I think would be helpful. Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Let me just \u2013 I'll take PZ first. I can say that negotiations and discussions are underway still. They're still occurring between the parties of the government. I really can't go out on a limb and predict when the resolution might occur. We're going on two years now where this has been an issue. I will say that the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is to get the equipment back up and running. We do continue to reduce operating expenses in PZ and continue to let people leave the payroll because we need to limit the losses that are occurring here. So I don't have any fresh news about when we might expect that restart, unfortunately. In Venezuela, I would just say it's a very tough circumstance for all of the people of Venezuela. We haven't had any or significant \u2013 it's really been minimal impact to our operations and our facilities. Priority number one for us is keeping our people safe, and so we're operating with that intention in mind. And Nigeria just continues to be a challenging location as well. There has been some disruption to production facilities in the first quarter of the year. We continue to monitor for safety there as well. Frank Mount : Thanks, Evan. Evan Calio : Great, I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, your question, please. Edward Westlake : Yes, good morning, a question for Steve on Australia. You had the issue I think with the flow meter, and you sorted that out on the trains. I wanted just to confirm that there isn't any design difference between Gorgon and Wheatstone, and therefore, what the risks are in terms of starting up at Wheatstone, that it's all been fixed based on the learnings at Gorgon, if I understood you correctly. Stephen W. Green: Yes, Ed. Thanks for the question. There are design differences. They're two different technologies in the plant between Gorgon and Wheatstone. But of any common equipment and any issues that we have dealt with in the startup of all three trains at Gorgon, we have communicated. And those issues have been addressed at Wheatstone to the extent they're common to Gorgon. That also includes \u2013 I mentioned our partner, Woodside, any issues that they have experienced in any of their facilities. We're benefiting from that as well, or Angola LNG. So any place we can get learnings or experience or borrow it, we're factoring that in and addressing it as best we can pre-startup to try to remove those variables. Edward Westlake : And then sticking with Australia, obviously at Gorgon you're talking about debottlenecking. It would be interesting to see what sort of debottlenecking uplift you can get from the plant, but also obviously there's Northwest Shelf, and there are other plants that need filling. Maybe how would those investments compete against each other? I obviously appreciate there's commercial terms to be negotiated as well. Stephen W. Green: Right. I guess I would start with your second part of your question first. We do have active work going on now to assess our large portfolio of discovered resource and look for commercial opportunities to accelerate that and commercialize that as the market materializes. So that work is ongoing, whether it be through one of our facilities or third-party facilities. With respect to Gorgon and debottlenecking, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have been looking forward to the day where we are today at Gorgon where we have all three trains up and running. We can begin to now tune and improve performance in the system as a whole. We have some additional equipment that will boost capacity as we bring that online. I mentioned a couple of examples of that in the prepared remarks. But this is really an opportunity to exercise what I consider a real core competency of the company, and that is getting more and more out of assets once they're up and operating. A terrific example of that is our long experience at Tengiz, where we have consistently improved performance and efficiency and increased the throughput from that facility. And we're looking forward to having a similar experience at Gorgon as we go forward in time. Specific to the debottlenecking, we'll analyze those opportunities, and some of those will be relatively short-term that we can do while we're in operation. Others are more complex and will require engineering and scheduling into planned outages or turnarounds as we go forward in time. Edward Westlake : Thanks, Steve. Stephen W. Green: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi, your question, please. Alastair R. Syme: Hi, everyone. Pat, can you talk about the cost trend on slide 12 a little bit, as you look back, how much you think those have been variable costs, such as energy and chemicals? And are you seeing any signs that that's beginning to come back? And I had a follow-up for Steve as well. Patricia E. Yarrington: So I would say just general in terms of inflationary pressures, the only place around the globe really that we are seeing inflationary pressures of any size would be in the Permian, and that's obviously being driven by activity levels in the Permian. And within the Permian, obviously we're working very hard to restrict that through our contracting strategy in terms of fixed-price contracts, indexed contracts, staggered contract terms, performance contracts, et cetera. Overall, we think that will be manageable for us, relatively small impact in 2017. And then outside the Permian, we really just haven't seen inflationary pressures. So I think in general, that's why I said that we intend \u2013 we're certainly striving to have a continued downward trend on operating expense in the remaining three quarters of the year, acknowledging that we will be bringing on additional production, and that will be an element going in the other direction. Alastair R. Syme: Thank you. And my follow-up to Steve \u2013 I know this is going to be a sensitive subject. But can you comment on what you think the Australian government is trying to achieve with its PRRT [Petroleum Resource Rent Tax] review and other aspects of the existing legislation that you would like to get changed? Stephen W. Green: I think as an investor, there's no difference in Australia than we look anywhere. We look for stability of fiscal terms and conditions that we invest under to be maintained over the life of those investments. So we have been and have been engaged with the government on the PRRT question, and that is a cautionary note for all investors, not just us. But the government yesterday in Australia released the initial report, and any changes that are contemplated will be prospective, which is exactly what our position was, is you can't go back and change the rules of the game after the investments are made. And so I think we have good engagement with the government. It has been a bit of irony. I was there last week, and the second story on page 1A is the emerging gas crisis, or energy crisis on the East Coast, which of course a solution will demand significant capital investment. So I think Australia is appropriately trying to find the right balance between their fiscal needs in the government and preserving what has been a very, very successful regime for attracting large capital investment, especially in our sector. Frank Mount : Thanks, Alastair. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil, your question, please. Blake Fernandez : Folks, good morning. Congrats on the results. I had two questions for you on the Permian. I know you already addressed the operated rig count, but my question was on the non-operated rig count. I think you said the base case contemplated 13 non-operated rigs. And just based on the level of activity increases we're seeing in the industry, it just seems like there's probably upward pressure there. So can you confirm whether you're getting pressure from peers to maybe increase activity on that and whether that probably leads to some upside on your base case? And then I guess tying in with the Permian question, the second is on the oil price realizations in the U.S. It seems like there was a pretty healthy increase in U.S. oil relative to the benchmarks. I didn't know if there was something one-off or this is just a function of Permian ramping up and that representing better realizations relative to the rest of the portfolio. Thanks. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, yes. So, Blake, I would say on the NOJV [Non-Operated Joint Venture] issue, I don't really have any significant information that would suggest the NOJV plan is any different than we had outlined. Currently, we've got 13 gross NOJV rigs, so that's five net. And I see that \u2013 I think in our plan as we look forward, there was ramping up some, but I don't have any new information relative to that. And with regard to the realizations, there's nothing unusual there in terms of one-offs on realizations. It really is just as a function of WTI prices, San Joaquin Valley prices, Mars prices, et cetera, and how those move relative to one another. Blake Fernandez : Fair enough, thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH, your question, please. Anish Kapadia : Hi. My first question was really to Steve to think about the Southeast Asia business from a more strategic standpoint. You've divested of the Bangladesh assets. There have been quite a few stories in the press that you've been looking at least at divesting of maybe some of your other Southeast Asian assets. And then on the other side, you have got some predevelopment pre-FID decisions to make on things like Ubon and further developments in Indonesia. So I just wanted to get an idea of how you view Southeast Asia within the context of the portfolio and the strategic decisions that you're thinking about for that portfolio. Stephen W. Green: Thanks for the question. Southeast Asia has long been and remains a core part of our upstream portfolio. We have a great business in Thailand, have had for 40-plus years. That business continues to perform very well. And in terms of incremental investments in Thailand beyond the base business, those are evaluated just like they are anywhere else in the company. The market, the terms and conditions, the resource, all those things \u2013 the cost of finding and development on a unit basis, all those things factor into our decision, whether it's Thailand or Indonesia as well. And our process for some time has been to go through the portfolio systematically and look at incremental investments on how they compete within the portfolio relative to our other opportunities. But notwithstanding the asset divestments that have been announced, Southeast Asia's still a very, very core part of our upstream portfolio and is performing well. Anish Kapadia : Thank you, and then a follow-up for Pat around cash flow. So you mentioned some impacts in Q1 that may turn around in the second half of the year, I think in terms of the working capital in particular. And I'm guessing also you've got the impact of projects ramping up in the second half of the year. So I'm just thinking in a flat oil price environment, should we expect significantly higher cash flow in the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2017? And also just related to that, are there any significant pension contribution impacts through the course of this year? Patricia E. Yarrington: So I would say in general, I think that's a good premise for you. If you look back over time, our first quarter tends to be typically our lowest cash generation quarter, and part of it is driven by the working capital. I did indicate that we saw a portion of that working capital most likely reversing between the end of this quarter and the end of the year, so I don't think you will get the same kind of penalty there per quarter. I'd also say \u2013 I mentioned the dividends, a potential coming in from TCO in the second half of the year, so that would be a positive in the remaining quarters of the year. If you go back to what I said back in March, one of the questions I had was about all of the summation of all of these \"headwinds\", and I had given an indication then of them being about $4 billion, a little bit over $4 billion for the year. And I still think that is a good element to think about when you consider the deferred tax impact, the working capital impact, and the difference between affiliate dividend and dividend earnings during the period. So all said, when you put that all together, I know there was a lot of numbers there. I do think the second part of the year we'll have stronger cash generation, not only from these reasons that I'm talking about, but production increases and the fact that these are high cash margin barrels that we're bringing on. Anish Kapadia : Okay, thanks. And just to clarify, that $4 billion, does that include the cash contributions to pensions? Patricia E. Yarrington: It would, it would. Anish Kapadia : Right, thank you. Frank Mount : Thanks, Anish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Frank Mount : Hi, Doug. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Doug. Doug Terreson : To me a positive aspect of the capital allocation and the corporate governance changes that are underway at the company is the increased emphasis on cash returns at the business unit level and specifically on project execution, at least in my opinion. And while John [Watson] talked about this some at the analyst meeting, I wanted to see if you could provide a progress report on this process in the upstream business, the timeframes over which the teams are going to be judged, and really any other factors that you deem relevant to positive execution and performance in this area. Patricia E. Yarrington: It's a good question. I think the best place that I would go because where we're seeing it in action is in TCO because this is the most significant capital project that we have underway at this point in time of a longer duration. And so we've talked about the fact that we were increasing the overall engineering that was done before we began to essentially cut steel. We've now started fabrication in Korea and the Kazakhstani yards. We're monitoring \u2013 we've done more in terms of design assurance there on that project, optimizing contracting strategy, taking advantage of the lower-cost environment. So I really think the benchmark in terms of how this will turn out in terms of all of these elements that Jay [Pryor] and John have talked about before in terms of major capital project execution, the benchmark on how we're doing will be with regard to TCO and how well it is coming forward. And right now, the overall progress, we're on track with elements of fabrication and construction of the port and we're underway with constructing the village, the housing village, et cetera, and the drilling is going very well. So all of those efforts are really being focused in real time on the TCO project. Doug Terreson : Okay, great. It'll be a good test case. And then also, Pat, there's a $2 billion sales proceeds figure floating around in the press for Bangladesh. And so my question, is that your number or is it somebody else's number, or is that a no comment at this point? Patricia E. Yarrington: That's a no comment at this point, so thank you very much for giving me that third option. Doug Terreson : Okay, thanks a lot, guys. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank, your question, please. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Maybe a follow-up to the earlier cash flow questions. You generated I think roughly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter beyond the dividend and you used it to pay down some debt. I realize there was an asset sale at the tail end of the quarter. But as you start to generate modest amounts of discretionary cash flow beyond CapEx and the dividend, how should we think about the use of the discretionary cash flow? How would you prioritize debt paydown versus buyback versus incremental capital spend? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so I'm just going to go back and reiterate what our priorities have long been. The first priority is going to be given to growing the dividend when we feel cash flow and earnings can support it for the long term, and by that I mean in perpetuity. Secondly, we look at future additional investment opportunities that we've got because we do need to continue to grow future revenue streams. And then we look at the balance sheet. It is important for us to continue to have a strong balance sheet. And what you saw in this quarter is really a flex in our commercial paper program, and that's part of why we have a commercial paper program is to take flex like this. So all of those are important to us. We do balance that. We're at a 24% debt ratio, which is an okay place to be, I would say. But over time, I'd like to see us move a little bit lower in the debt profile when cash flow permits us to do that. Maintaining a AA is important to us. We did just meet with the rating agencies. We did just get affirmed by Moody's as a AA stable. We haven't heard from S&P yet, but it's an important element for us. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks. And then maybe you have a slide there in the deck. I think it's slide 10, showing efficiency gains across the base portfolio as well. And obviously for investors the efficiency gains in the U.S. onshore has been a huge area of focus and generally is quite transparent. Can you talk a little bit more about the efficiency gains that you're seeing across the broader global portfolio? Do you think the market underestimates gains outside the U.S? And is the 30 to 35-plus percentage type of gains that you're showing here and a couple anecdotal things, is that representative of the type of gains you're seeing across the broader portfolio? Stephen W. Green: The chart that you referenced, of course, is specific to our Thailand operations. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are transferring both people and learnings from those operations into the Permian, into AMBU [Appalachia-Michigan Business Unit], into other places where we have this factory well approach. And we are seeing those kind of gains in efficiency and driving down our unit cost. Another example that's probably a little less visible perhaps comes from Indonesia. Last year in Indonesia, in our Duri operations, which is a heavy oil steam flood, we were able to drive down the cost of our steam, which is our largest line item of OpEx, by over 40%, without degradating the production, no impact to production. So again, as I said in response to a question about Gorgon, this is the sweet spot of Chevron's core capability is transferring learnings and ways to get efficiency and operate assets in the portfolio and get more and more out of them as we go forward. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Sure, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP, your question, please. Theepan Jothilingam : Yes, hi. Good morning, Pat. Good morning, gentlemen. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning. Theepan Jothilingam : Just coming back to the financials, could you perhaps just talk a little bit about cash taxes? I know you've quantified the deferred tax impact this quarter. But just going forward at Chevron, let's say at $50, how should we think of cash tax rate? And then my follow-up question was just on PZ. Again, broadly speaking, what type of run rate should we be thinking about on OpEx and how we actually capture that back if and when PZ volumes are back onstream? Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, so I'll take PZ first. I don't want to get into describing what our ongoing operating costs are here when we've got an asset that is not operating. I will just say that when it does come back online, these cumulative losses will be taken into account in terms of the eventual recovery, tax recovery that's available to us. In terms of cash tax, this is a hard area for us to forecast at this particular time because of just issues that I've explained before about tax loss carryforwards and the fact that we've got different jurisdictions with different circumstances as their current tax position standpoint. I would say in general, we do still have some jurisdictions at current prices that are generating tax losses. And so that means that these tax losses will be carried forward into future periods. And when oil prices rise from $50 to $60 to $70, if you assume that hypothesis, we do need higher prices here to recover some of those previously deferred or those tax losses that have been carried forward that cannot then be carried back and will become a cash benefit, a relative cash benefit in future periods. That's really the best guidance that I can give you at this point in time. At low prices, there is not a lot of \u2013 we do have cash taxes in some locations, but it is not in all locations. Theepan Jothilingam : Is there any way to quantify that number in terms of an aggregate number there, if prices were to recover, Chevron could use in terms of tax allowances? Patricia E. Yarrington: I don't have it handy here. It's something I can consider for future disclosures. Theepan Jothilingam : Great. Thank you, Pat. Frank Mount : I Thanks, Theepan. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, I think that concludes our call for this morning. I want to thank everybody for your time today, and we certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on the call. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown here on slide two. I'll begin with a discussion of our second quarter 2017 financial results and Jay will then provide an update on our Upstream business prior to my concluding remarks. Turning now to slide three, an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $1.5 billion or $0.77 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $430 million as well as asset sale gains of $160 million. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange gains of $3 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.7 billion or $0.91 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5 billion, reflecting high margin production growth and strong Downstream performance. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations was $5.3 billion. At quarter-end, debt balances stood at approximately $43 billion, more than $3 billion lower than where we began the year. Our debt ratio is currently 22.7%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 2017. We currently yield 4.1%. Turning to slide four. Year-to-date, net cash generation after dividends was $1 billion including $200 million generated in the second quarter. This result is a solid down payment on our full year objective of being cash balanced at $50 Brent including asset sales. Cash flow from operations was $5 billion in the quarter, up $2.5 billion from the second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date, cash from operations has totaled $8.9 billion despite working capital consumption and adverse deferred tax impacts, each sized at approximately $1.2 billion, as well as affiliate earnings exceeding dividends by $1.4 billion. Cash capital spend for the quarter was $3.2 billion, approximately $1.3 billion less than the second quarter of 2016. We continued to reduce our spend by finishing our major capital projects under construction and driving capital efficiency gains throughout our investment queue. Second quarter asset sale proceeds were approximately $430 million primarily from the sale of proxies in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado and some on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect our cash outcomes to favorably reflect growing production and additional proceeds from asset sales. Despite some anticipated unevenness between third quarter and fourth quarter, for example related to the precise timing of sales transactions, pension contributions and affiliate dividends, we do fully expect to end the year in a cash balance position at current prices. Slide five compares current-quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2017 results were $2.9 billion higher than second quarter 2016. Special items, primarily the absence of $2.4 billion in second quarter's 2016 net charges, partially offset by current period net charges of $270 million improved earnings by $2.1 billion between periods. An unfavorable movement in foreign exchange negatively impacted the earnings comparison by $276 million between periods. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased nearly $950 million between periods. Increased volumes and higher realization as well as lower operating expenses were partially offset by increased DD&A associated with increased production. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased nearly $380 million primarily driven by higher margins and a swing in timing effects. The variance in the Other segment was primarily due to unfavorable corporate tax items. As we've indicated previously, quarterly results in the Other segment are likely to be non-ratable and we continued to guide to $1.6 billion in annual net charges for this segment. I'll now pass it over to Jay. James William Johnson : Thank you, Pat. Slide six compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter 2017 production was 2.78 million barrels a day, an increase of 252,000 barrels a day or 10% over the second quarter of 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 265,000 barrels per day as we started and ramped up multiple projects including Gorgon, Angola LNG, Jack/St. Malo, Alder, Moho Nord, Mafumeira Sul and Bangka. Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels a day primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian. The increases were partially offset by normal field declines and PFE effects. The other bar includes the loss of 38,000 barrels a day due to 2016 asset sales. Turning to slide seven. Year-to-date 2017 production is 2.73 million barrels a day. Up 5% from 2016 and within our guidance range of 4% to 9% growth excluding asset sales. Our expectation is that full year production will be well within our original guidance range. The ramp-up of production in the second quarter was strong, with June's monthly production at 2.85 million barrels per day. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see reliable production from the assets that are currently onstream, further growth in the Permian and Wheatstone coming online. Some of these increases will be offset in the third quarter due to normal turnaround activity. Year-to-date there's been no impact on production from 2017 asset sales since the first transactions involving producing assets closed on June 30. Assets sold year-to-date and assets expected to be sold later this year have a combined daily production of around 175,000 barrels per day. The impact on full year 2017 production from asset sales is expected to be 25,000 to 75,000 barrels a day given the late in year timing for the sales. Turning to slide eight. We're seeing strong performance at Gorgon. All three trains have achieved or exceeded nameplate capacity and are operating smoothly. On a 100% basis, second quarter Gorgon production was 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is currently averaging around 430,000 barrels a day. We are currently producing around 3 billion cubic feet of gas a day from 14 wells. In the second quarter, domestic gas sales were approximately 125 million cubic feet per day and condensate production was around 14,000 barrels a day. We shipped 88 LNG cargoes so far this year. Looking forward, we're focused on achieving sustained operations and are analyzing plant performance to find opportunities to increase reliability and production. Additional fine tuning of the plant will maximize efficiency and we expect further debottlenecking opportunities to increase plant capacity. Turning to slide nine. We're on track at Wheatstone. The Wheatstone platform and pipeline are operational and supplying natural gas to the inlet of the onshore LNG plant. Early well performance is encouraging. We're in the process of starting up the plant and expect to commence cool-down shortly. LNG production is expected to follow next month. Train 2 construction is progressing well and we're on track to start up six to eight months after Train 1. Turning to slide 10. The future growth project, or FGP, is progressing well, and I'll highlight some milestones. Module fabrication is in progress in Korea and Kazakhstan, as is the fabrication of gas turbine generators in Italy. Dredging is essentially complete, and other activities required for the initiation of port operations are on track. Infrastructure work and site construction are progressing, and we're 75% complete with our piloting program. We have two drilling rigs in operation on multi-well pads, with a third rig expected in August. We're on track for first production in 2022. In addition to FGP, we're also making progress on a number of other major capital projects. At Hebron, offshore Canada, the platform's been installed on location and we expect first oil before year-end 2017. Projects expected to come online in 2018 include Clair Ridge in the North Sea, where offshore hookup and commissioning is well underway; the Stampede platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which was recently installed on location; the Big Foot platform, which is preparing for sail away around the end of this year; and Tahiti, where we're progressing the Vertical Expansion project. These projects are expected to add approximately 20,000 net barrels of new production in 2018 and 65,000 net barrels in 2019. Let's turn to slide 11. This is an updated map of the Permian Basin including Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our two million acres, 1.5 million of which are Midland and Delaware Basins, are depicted in blue. Outlined on the map are our Chevron-operated and non-operated development areas. Additionally, on the right side of the chart, we've included an updated version of our assessment of acreage valuation. Currently, we estimate that approximately 650,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 an acre, and an additional 450,000 acres have a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation. Some lacks nearby infrastructure, and other requires further appraisal. As a reminder, these estimates are a snapshot that assumes simultaneous development at a $50 WTI price, burdened with all the development and production costs as we see them today. Let's turn to slide 12. This slide illustrates our returns-focused Permian development strategy. We're investing for value. We're applying technology and learning from others to drive capital efficiency. Let me provide a few examples of how we're using technology as a competitive advantage. We're using seismic data to detect variations in the properties of reservoirs to identify the optimal areas. We're then applying petrophysical modeling to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of rocks and their contained fluids, and we integrate geophysical information with production data to identify the most productive intervals, and to select well locations that offer the highest returns. We perform focused data analytic studies to optimize horizontal well placement and well spacing decisions. To do this, we have a comprehensive database of industry wells with production, completion, reservoir, and operational data. We also use this data to optimize our completions for proppant loading, cluster spacing, and liquid loading. During drilling operations, we use well and model data to make precise wellbore placement decisions to keep the well path within the most productive depth, often within a 10-foot interval. Our Integrated Operations Center provides support to our field personnel, who have access to real-time, operational data on mobile devices. As an example, real-time equipment information, such as excessive compressive vibration, can provide an early indication of a potential problem, allowing us to react before downtime occurs. But the real key in all this is effectively applying the technology to deliver better outcomes. We also learn by watching others. The graphs on the right side are one example of how we successfully combine our application of technology with our learning from others. The initial six months' recoveries per lateral foot are highlighted on the charts for wells in two different benches. In red are the actual results of Competitor A, who's a strong growth player in the basin, employing a strategy of speed to the development of the second Bone Spring and Avalon horizons in the Delaware Basin. They got there first, they drilled aggressively in each horizon, and they demonstrated production growth. However, their strategy of trial and error required them to spend significant capital. We've learned from their experience. The blue on the chart shows our actual results in the same horizons. For a similar number of wells, we're recovering more production per foot, and our cost per foot is lower than our competitor. Our strategy is working. We believe real value is created through capital efficiency and discipline, as well as strong, consistent execution. Let's go to slide 13. This chart illustrates three elements of financial performance. Our current financial metrics, the competitiveness of our current spend, and the attractiveness of returns for future investments. First, our unconventional Permian business, fully loaded with overhead cost, has positive after-tax earnings for the first half of 2017. We forecast earnings growth, even at flat prices in future periods, as a result of lower unit operating costs and depreciation rates. Our depreciation rates are expected to further decline as we cycle through prior invested capital and replace it with today's more efficient development costs. At actual 2017 oil, gas, and NGL prices, our year-to-date operating cash flow per barrel is approximately $20 and is accretive to Chevron's overall portfolio. Second, our unit development and operating costs are competitive and declining. The chart on the right compares our company operated with our non-operated JV costs. As you can see, cost reduction progress has been encouraging, and we are increasingly competitive. And third, the Permian is an attractive place to make future investments. We estimate, as noted in the box at the bottom, that our 2017 investments in the Permian, fully loaded with overhead, will generate greater than 30% returns at a $50 a barrel WTI price. Turning to slide 14. We're actively managing our Permian portfolio through acreage swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales. This chart shows our historical and forecasted transaction activity in the Midland and Delaware Basins. We've identified between 150,000 and 200,000 acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins that we plan to transact to generate more immediate value. A recent transaction effectively more than tripled the value of our acreage simply by enabling longer laterals. Generally, the highest value transactions are swaps to core up acreage and enhance value through long laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies. In 2017, we've already closed seven deals and have grouped the remaining acreage into a number of packages that are actively being marketed. Slide 15. Production continues to track ahead of expectations as we continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance. The chart on the left shows our second quarter, 2017 production of approximately 178,000 barrels a day, up about 44,000 barrels a day from the second quarter of 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compounded annual growth rate of 20% to 35%. And we're currently near the top of that range. Today, we're operating 13 rigs and our plan is to continue to add rigs approximately every eight to ten weeks achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we expect to see our share of production from non-operated rigs. Our objective in the Permian is to generate value through capital and execution efficiency. We intend to be fully competitive on our unit development and production costs and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance. With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Turning now to slide 16. We continue to see lower capital spending as well as lower operating expense outlays despite significant production increases. C&E outlays have averaged $4.5 billion per quarter this year. That's over $1 billion lower than the average quarter in 2016 and over 50% lower than the average quarter in 2014. 2017 year-to-date total C&E is $8.9 billion. We are trending below our full year guidance and conservatively would expect full year C&E to come in around $19 billion. A positive pattern is also evidenced with operating expenses. The average quarter this year is $5.6 billion, $650 million lower than the average quarter in 2016 and 25% lower than the average quarter back in 2014. We expect to close out 2017 with operating expenses $1.5 billion to $2 billion lower than 2016. Second half costs will reflect growing production, the impact of asset sales and continued cost containment efforts throughout the enterprise. Now on slide 17, we're on target with our asset sales program. In fact, we're already in the $5 billion to $10 billion proceeds range that we established for the 2016 and 2017 years. With six of the eight quarters behind us, cumulative asset sale proceeds now total $5.3 billion; $2.5 billion so far this year and $2.8 billion last year. During the remainder of 2017, we have a number of transactions that are listed on the slide, where sales and purchase agreements are signed. We currently anticipate having at least $1 billion closing in the third quarter. Many of the remaining transactions are international in nature. These are often complex and subject to multiple regulatory agency oversight making timing uncertain. When all is said and done, we expect 2016 to 2017 sales proceeds to be solidly within the established guidance range. Now turning to slide 18. I'd like to close out my comments this morning on cash flow. We have an improvement trend underway with the first half of the year net cash positive after dividends by $1 billion. Production is up, in particular, high cash margin production is up and capital spend is down. We're getting more efficient and our cost structure is coming down. We're executing well on our asset sales and we're realizing good value in those transactions. We're also focused on improving returns. We expect this to happen as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volumes. It'll happen as we pivot to shorter cycle time, high return investments. We showed you the opportunity we have in the Permian for high return investments. And returns will be aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in how we manage our capital projects. We're competitively positioned with a very strong portfolio. We're confident we're taking all the steps within our control to enhance our competitiveness longer term. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary, and we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open up the lines. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Philip M. Gresh: Hi. Good morning, Pat and Jay. Patricia E. Yarrington: (24:09) Philip M. Gresh: First question \u2013 morning. First question is Pat, you made some commentary in the very beginning here about the transitory factors adding up to about $3.8 billion of headwinds in the first half of the year. And if you go back to the Analyst Day, I think the number you gave for the full year at that time was $4 billion of headwinds that you were expecting. So it seems pretty front half, 1H loaded in terms of how that's played out. But just wondering if that's still a good number to be thinking about for the full year. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so good question. And I would say within our ability to forecast these things I think that is still very reasonable guidance that we gave you back in the SAM, certainly within that range. Philip M. Gresh: Got it. Okay. And the second question is just around the capital spending reduction. You noted $19 billion but conservatively so. As I think about that number, and what's imbedded in there for Gorgon and Wheatstone and CPChem, et cetera, it seems like it's $2 billion if not $3 billion of spend for some projects that'll be rolling off. So as I look ahead to 2018 and beyond, you had that $17 billion to $22 billion range that you had given. And so if we take the roll-off against the conservative $19 billion, it would seem like you're tracking pretty well in a $50 Brent world to be at or even maybe below that range longer term. But I'm sure there's some offset. So maybe you could just talk about how you see the puts and takes around that, and especially in light of your peer today saying they're seeing some upward inflationary pressure. Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. I think the guidance that we've given so far, we stand by. I did say $19 billion conservatively. We do anticipate additional activity in the Permian in the second half of the year. We mentioned about having the rig rates running up and so additional activity there. We do anticipate seeing more spending out of TCO as that FGP project ramps up and we also have additional spending in the Agbami infill drilling program. So there are some elements that we can see adding to outlays in the second half of the year. You're absolutely right. There will be offsets with Gorgon and Wheatstone trailing off certainly. And as I look forward to 2018, I do think that we have \u2013 we did say $17 billion to $22 billion, but we would be at the low end of that range if prices are hovering around $50. And I think that is still the best guidance that we can offer at this point. We as we normally do, we're in the middle of putting our business plans together and as we move through the second half of the year here, we will get much greater confirmation of that capital program really looks like. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Phil. Philip M. Gresh: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. James William Johnson : Hey, Doug. Doug Leggate : Jay, I'm going to take advantage of you being on the call. Clearly the Permian is running well ahead of your guidance. I wonder if you could speak to \u2013 I guess there's a number of facets to this. What's driving the beat? How did it impact your guidance? And from a broader portfolio standpoint, you've clearly got an enormous footprint that could really stand on itself in terms of sustaining your or offsetting your decline rate. So how does the (27:33) even think about capital allocation? Think about getting pregnant with a six-year, large scale development versus the flexibility this gives you in the broader portfolio. So strategically what role does this play going forward and what happens to the guidance? James William Johnson : So you're correct. We're seeing very good performance out of the Permian. Our drive on capital efficiency and good execution is really paying off for us. We also have seen good performance from our new basis of design. It's early yet but the results are encouraging. As we look at our overall portfolio and as we finish the period of heavy capital spend that we've been on, we have a pretty youthful portfolio that allows us a lot of opportunity to continue to build now on the infrastructure that's been installed and to capitalize on the Permian as a very large resource base for us. Our current plan that we've given you has the rigs running up to 20 company operated rigs by the end of next year. One thing I really like about the Permian is we're monitoring financial performance and financial returns virtually on a real-time basis. And as we continue to see performance out of Permian, we have the option to continue to expand that rig fleet or to hold the rig fleet depending on the performance that we're seeing. So we have seen a continued set of surprises to the upward over the years as we've shown you what the Permian can do for us and I would expect to see continued performance as we move forward. What's first and foremost, out of all this is that the Permian is one of our primary assets and it will attract the capital that's necessary. We are not holding back capital to the Permian and I don't think we'll need to. As these big capital programs roll off, the amount of discretionary capital allocation that we have has been increasing pretty significantly and that's going to continue over the next several years. So I'm very encouraged. Doug Leggate : Thanks for the answer, Jay. My follow-up is for Pat. And, Pat, obviously the slide on Permian asset sales, just to be clear, I'm not entirely sure if you were indicating that those would be outright disposals or swaps because even at the low end of your valuation, the $20,000 an acre, that could be a $3.5 billion type number. Maybe you could just clarify that, and just a broad update on, is the $10 billion still a good number? And maybe just as a quick add-on, CapEx, combined, if we put the two together, it looks like free cash flow could be hitting a fairly substantial inflection point. Is your CapEx going to end coming in light as well? I'll leave it there. Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. So just a point of clarification, on the Permian slide where we talked about opportunities for transaction, that is a combination of swaps, leasing and sale. And as another point of clarification, that activity was not anticipated in our $5 billion to $10 billion asset sale proceeds guidance range that we had given. So that would be on top of that. And we haven't really made a distinction. We haven't clarified publicly what the proportionality of swaps versus leases, versus sales is. As we said, the priority really is on the swaps because that's where really you can capture the greatest value by being able to extend the laterals. And we also said there's a number of sales packages that are also out in the marketplace. I do think we are \u2013 this is a \u2013 2017 is a transition year. And I think we are very much at a point of inflection as we get through this year in terms of higher cash generation from the assets that are online, higher margin-accretive production, lower operating expenses as well as lower C&E outlays and greater flexibility around the capital program altogether. So I think it is very much a transition year and an inflection year. Doug Leggate : Thanks. So just to be clear, Pat. Does the CapEx ramp up in the second half or are you trending well \u2013 you're obviously trending well under your guidance. Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. We're just saying we didn't think it was appropriate for people to take the first half of the year and double it and think that that's where we were going to close out the year because we do have certain elements where we see some outlays increasing. Doug Leggate : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Evan Calio : Hey, good morning, everybody and great results. James William Johnson : Hey. Evan Calio : A few questions for Jay if I can. There's a significant high-grading in the Permian inventory in one quarter where you've added additional 50,000 acres at the $50 value \u2013 $50 per acre \u2013 $50,000 per acre and 100,000 at the $20,000 to $50,000 range. Can you discuss what drove the change? Was that one factor or multiple? And is that inventory review process a quarterly ongoing process? Just trying to understand or get an understanding of the progression or potential future rate of change here. James William Johnson : Thank you, Evan. The actual update isn't a quarterly update. I think the last time we gave you that data was third quarter of last year. So it's over a period of time. But there are a number of factors that drive that increased valuation. Probably first and foremost is just the increasing efficiency we're continuing to see, both in terms of our recoveries and our cost development and operating cost per foot. So those are driving, to a large extent, the increased valuations that we're seeing, because they're based on our well performance. So, we would expect to see \u2013 we'll continue to update these periodically. We won't do it probably quarterly, because it's just too much effort focused on keeping track of all the acreage, but the general message is, our acreage position, we continue to work it hard. We continue to look for the next best development areas. We're using technology and the experience of others, and we are seeing continued improvement in those valuations. And then we're delivering those results. Evan Calio : Great. And my second question is on \u2013 you had great progressions on both DD&A and LOE in the newer slide indicate DD&A dropping 30% by 2020. I mean is that for incremental wells in 2020, or the entire Permian unconventional business by 2020? And on the LOE side, any color there on what's driving the difference? Whether that's be efficient infrastructure buildout or a shift to multi-well pad development? James William Johnson : It's a combination of things. On the capital side, the DD&A is really a mix of what we've already got in the portfolio, plus the new wells being added on a continuing basis. But because of the profile of production on these wells, we have a pretty rapid turnover of the capital employed through the depreciation schedule. And so, as we move forward in time, the wells that we're drilling today are more efficient than the wells we drilled last year and the year before, and we're just seeing this progression and decrease of DD&A consistent with the decrease in our unit development costs. From a lease-operating standpoint, we have looked at our actual organization structures. We looked at how we're organized. We look at the efficiency of our factory model. We're using the Integrated Operation Center to keep our production reliability as high as possible. And, as we build scale, we don't have to increase the organization in direct proportion to the scale, so we start getting more and more economies of scale in our operations. So all those together, with the advances in the technology that we're really applying on a very real-time basis, we see this drive to continue to become more efficient. Unknown Speaker : Thank you, Evan. Evan Calio : Maybe just a follow-up to that, on the multi-well pad development, just where are you today versus where you'll be in 2020, maybe in terms of percentage of activity? Is there a big change or improvement there? James William Johnson : Virtually all of our development activity now, all 13 rigs, are running in multi-well pad mode and factory mode. The only wells you'll see in the future in the Permian that won't be that basis might be some expiration wells that we do to stay ahead of our development drilling. But that would be a very small percentage of the wells. Evan Calio : Okay. Thank you. Impressive. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please. Paul Cheng : Good morning, guys. James William Johnson : Morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Morning. Paul Cheng : Jay, just, this may be a little bit theoretical, but let's assume that by year 2020, you are running at 20 rigs and that by then, that you probably already reach at the 450,000 barrel per day or so. At that point, what kind of oil price and gas price you need in order for that to be as a self-sustained cash flow breakeven? Any kind of rough number? And also then, as you're looking at Permian, clearly the resource is impressive, but I got to believe that still have a sweet spot in terms of the resource and the peak production ratio. Any kind of help you can give us, that \u2013 I know that your result will ultimately be multiple over time of the $9.3 billion (37:22) that you are citing. But if we're looking at a result at a certain level, what will be a reasonable RP ratio to achieve the optimum capital efficiency from you guys' standpoint in the Permian? James William Johnson : Okay, so from the Permian in terms of breakeven position, we gave you guidance in the SAM meeting back in March that if we \u2013 we're growing our rig fleet to 20 rigs, is our intention by the end of 2018, and then we have options at that point. But if we should decide to hold at 20 rigs and just continue to run those 20 rigs, under the current conditions with the current performance, we would expect to be cash-flow positive overall. But what's really important here is, we're looking at the returns each and every well and development area give us as we're drilling those areas and as we make the decision on the next area, and those are all very positive. How much we choose to invest into the Permian on an ongoing basis, or on an expansion basis, is really part of our portfolio allocation of, where do we get the best returns. So we're not really worried about whether the Permian in and of itself is returning positive net cash flow, as long as the underlying wells in development are all strongly positive on their financial performance. So, our view is that we're going to get to 20 rigs. We're going to understand our performance and the conditions in the Permian, and we have the option to continue to increase rigs beyond that point should we choose, and should that be an optimal place for us to continue to invest. Terms of the sweet spot, it's really \u2013 we're working on the best spots today. But what's important is, as we continue to drive more efficiencies into the business, as we continue to advance the technologies that I talked about and the application of those, what we're finding is that we're continuing to drive down our unit development cost such that we can move into areas that might not have been so attractive before are becoming more and more attractive today. And also, as the infrastructure buildout continues, we are able then to bring in some of these lower value areas now become more and more attractive, because they don't have to underpin infrastructure. We can just use what's already been built out in the past. So overall, we see a very good resource picture. We'll use exploration to stay ahead of the game, and that's really our focus. Paul Cheng : So you guys not really looking at, say, an RP pressure ratio, say, 30 or 40 or 25 will be the optimum. So that's not a consideration. Or that's at least not the way how you look at \u2013 how much is the overall typical program that you may end up to be. James William Johnson : No. We're really looking at the financial performance of the developments that are in front of us and the results that we're achieving out of the investments we've made and comparing that with the opportunities that we have across our portfolio. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please. Jason Gammel : Yes. Thanks very much and hi, everyone. Wanted to ask couple of questions about Gorgon if I could please. First of all, you're currently running essentially at or above nameplate capacity, but you did mention specific items like building reliability and fine tuning the process on the slide. Just wondering if this running at nameplate capacity is something that we can look forward to for the rest of the year or if you will still have some shake-out maintenance as we look towards year-end. James William Johnson : Thank you. Gorgon's running really well. And particularly as we saw Train 2 and then Train 3 start up, Train 3 start-up was a beautiful thing. We're really pleased with it; it looked great. And so now all three trains are stable at or above nameplate. And that was our goal. When we look at the reliability, it's how many trips or how many times does the plant go offline, and obviously we want to eliminate those so that the plants run reliably day in and day out. And then on top of that, we start getting the plant performance data so we can look at what are the bottlenecks that we can correct that'll allow us to then increase the ultimate capacity of the plant. There may be some short pit stops that we'll take from time to time that are going to be economically driven and planned, if we find that some of those opportunities require us to take the plan offline to make that adjustment. There are other things that we'll continue to make adjustments while they're online and running. So on balance, I expect to see us running at these levels throughout the year. There may be times we'll take short pit stops but those would be planned in advance and they'll be driven by economics. Jason Gammel : Great. And then if I could just do a follow-up on Wheatstone actually. Sounds like start-up is pretty imminent so I assume there's really nothing on a critical path for Train 1 and that you're just in commissioning process. Just wondering if there's anything still on the critical path for Train 2 to achieve that six- to eight-month start-up or if it's very similar to Train 1 where you just really are now into more of a commissioning phase. James William Johnson : So on Wheatstone Train 1, you're correct, we are in the final stages of commissioning, and in fact, we are now into the true start-up phase. So we expect to see cool-down occurring here shortly. There's really no construction going on at all in Train 1 and commissioning is largely complete. In Train 2, we still are in bulk construction mode. But we expect to see that winding down in the fourth quarter and at this point in time, really don't see any particular on obstacles or challenges in our path to getting Train 2 complete and getting into the commissioning and start-up. There's always the issues of moving from bulk construction into the sequence of commissioning but we've got teams all over that. And just as we saw at Gorgon as we move from Trains 1, 2 and 3, we expect to see continuing efficiency both in the final construction and in that transition to commissioning building on the experience of the first train. Unknown Speaker : Thanks Jason. Jason Gammel : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. James William Johnson : Hi, Neil. Patricia E. Yarrington: Morning. Neil Mehta : First question I had was just around base decline rates. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your portfolio on a base decline rate basis and then also any thoughts in terms of how you see that evolving going forward? James William Johnson : Sure. Base declines have actually been quite good. The shift in strategy as we've moved from the heavy new greenfield investments into a focus on leveraging maximum value from our installed infrastructure base on install base business has been paying big dividends. So the infield drilling programs, the focus on reliability, the workover programs have been really sustaining our production, I think better than we would have expected given the amount of capital and costs that we've pulled out of the system. We have the advantage of a portfolio that has a lot of young assets. So as we start installing things like \u2013 or start taking advantage of things like Jack/St. Malo and the other projects that I mentioned that are coming online this year and next year as well as Gorgon and Wheatstone, we are seeing a very young portfolio. Lots of continued opportunities for infield drilling and, really, brownfield expansions. And there's a lot of value in that, even at today's prices. Neil Mehta : I appreciate the comments, Jay. And the follow-up is just on some of the areas of disrupted production or areas where there's been a lot of focus on geopolitical issues. And just wanted your comments on three areas in particular, recognizing there could be some limitations in terms of the comments here. One would be Partitioned Zone, two would be Venezuela, and three would be Nigeria. Any updates from Chevron's perspective would be helpful. James William Johnson : Sure. In the Partitioned Zone, the stopping of production continues. There's been no restart activity. There are continuing negotiations and dialogue between the two governments. We continue to advocate for a return to the status quo, get the field back in production while the longer-term issues are addressed. But at this point in time, there has not been any movement towards a restart. Somewhat perplexing to us, but we'll continue to play the role of facilitator and see if we can't get the fields restarted. I think it's in everyone's best interest. In terms of Venezuela, we have continued to be operational. We do not have major impacts on our operations at this point in time, and it's just a situation we continue to monitor. Our priority is on just maintaining safe operations, and protecting our people and assets. And in Nigeria, we continue to see good performance coming out of Nigeria. There are disruptions from time to time, but it has not had, I would consider, a material adverse effect. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Jay. Congrats on the good quarter. James William Johnson : (46:54). Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil. Your question, please. Blake Fernandez : Folks, good morning. I had two questions. One for Pat and one for Jay, please. Pat, on the CapEx, obviously, it looks like you're lowering the guidance from 19.8 billion down to $19 billion. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you see that impacting the cash flow breakeven that you've articulated around $50 a barrel. Presumably, there's some downward pressure there, but any color on that? Patricia E. Yarrington: Well, I mean, I think that would be a normal outcome, an intuitive sort of outcome. Obviously, if we have a little bit less spending, that's where you would fall out. I mean, I think the larger flywheel for us here may be exactly the timing of asset sales during the second half of the year. As I mentioned, many of those are international transactions and getting a bead on exactly when they will close, whether they will close in fourth quarter or perhaps move into first quarter, there's still some uncertainty around those. Blake Fernandez : Okay. Second question on the Permian, Jay. Based on the feedback we're hearing from some of the refiners, it sounds like we're getting relatively close to exhausting the light sweet processing capacity along the Gulf Coast, and we're starting to see some batching, which kind of indicates we're preparing for some oil exports. I didn't know how that would impact your growth rates and is there an opportunity? Are you planning to participate in exports? Or is that really something you're just going let the midstream players kind of handle on their own? Thanks. James William Johnson : Well, look, when we've talked before about how we look at the Permian, we look at the whole value chain. So everything from our development, operating cost on the front end to the realizations we get on the back end. And we've done a lot of good work to open up multiple pathways to get our products to market so that we can take advantage of the different variations in the markets. So we have been working to stay ahead of our build out curve. At this point, we don't see any constrictions on our ability to grow, as we've discussed, in the Permian. And this is an area that we'll continue to stay focused on and seek the best realizations as we move forward. Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Blake. Blake Fernandez : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please? Doug Terreson : Hi, everybody. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hi. James William Johnson : Hello. Unknown Speaker : Hey, Doug. Doug Terreson : Jay, I had just a clarification question for you. A few minutes ago you talked about 30% returns in the Permian. And when you say 30% returns, are you talking about fully-burdened returns? Or conventional return on capital type definition? Or drilling decision returns? Or what are we talking about there? James William Johnson : No, when we're talking about 30% returns, we're basing that on a $50 WTI price, $2.50 (49:45) gas, $25 NGLs. And what we are doing is looking at our all-in costs, so we're not cherry picking just development costs or anything like that. But this is what we really expect to see, full returns, fully burdened. Doug Terreson : Okay. So, Jay, it includes facilities and land costs and all the other things that some people leave out. Is that correct? James William Johnson : Yes. Doug Terreson : Okay. Just wanted to be sure. And then also had a question for Pat. Pat, the performance in your Downstream business has improved significantly. Your returns are not only above the cost of capital, but they're as close to that of some of your peers as they've been in a decade or so from what I can tell. I mean, they've gotten to be really good. So when you consider this increase in absolute and relative value of that business, I wanted to see if we could get your updated perspective how you think about that business, meaning besides my point about rising relative and absolute value, what are some of the other factors that you consider when you think about whether or not the R&M and chemicals business should be a core part of the portfolio, longer term? Patricia E. Yarrington: Well, we do completely believe the R&M should be a core part of our portfolio long-term. We like our integrated model, not only for the hedge that it makes in terms offsetting commodity price impacts on the Upstream side, but we use it, importantly, in terms of kind of knowledge transfer between Downstream and Upstream for the efficient operations of plants and facilities. So it's a core part of our business. I think we have been very successful over the last decade really. James William Johnson : Yeah. Patricia E. Yarrington: In improving the returns on Downstream, through some of the transactions and the fine tuning of the portfolio, optimizing of the portfolio that we've done. Plus significant effort around cost management and cost containment. It's a growth opportunity for us if you're including the chemical sector in here as well. So I think it's a key part of our portfolio going forward and we would look to expand and evaluate its investment opportunities for future growth projects. Just along the way we would look at other opportunities. It would compete for capital for future investments as well, in the chemical sector in particular. Doug Terreson : Okay. No it's been real successful. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Doug. Doug Terreson : Just real success story for you guys. Thanks a lot. Patricia E. Yarrington: Absolutely. Doug Terreson : Yep. James William Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please? Anish Kapadia : Hi. First question was going back to your Permian position. So you talked about the \u2013 gave a bit more detail about the asset of swaps and sales going forward. But I think one the big stores of value that you have that you could potentially bring forward is the value of your royalty position. If you look at where some of the pure play lifted royalty names are trading in North America. So I'm just wondering, have you thought about maybe selling or monetizing some of your royalty positions in the current, very low interest rate environment? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, Anish, so obviously, this is a topical area there. We're certainly very much aware of the opportunity, and we have evaluated it. But I think the best I can say at this point is, we don't have any plans for anything like this at this point in time. Anish Kapadia : Okay. Thank you. And then I had a follow-up. We used to (53:26) get a little bit of an update on your North American activity onshore outside of the Permian. And just thinking about your updated plans in terms of the Duvernay in California, what's the outlook there? And also the Marcellus and, combined with that, is there any thoughts of maybe hedging in the gas price to lock in returns, to be able to put rigs back to work? James William Johnson : So as we look at the different assets that we have across North America, one of the things that we are very active on is sharing the information and best practices that are being developed in each area with the other unconventional areas. So we've seen cost, development cost, come down in the Duvernay. We've been largely involved in an appraisal program and a land tenure strategy. But now, with the results that we're seeing, we have a good-sized resource there and we are evaluating, as Pat mentioned earlier, our business plan at the current time on just what we want to do there, but it's very encouraging. We'll give you more details on each of those in the SAM meeting next year. In terms of the Marcellus, we've also seen our cost structure come down significantly, as well as our drilling efficiency improve. So that also has some promise, especially with the recovery in gas price, as to whether or not we hedge. That's something that we'll evaluate as part of putting together our strategy going forward. Another key area for us is the San Joaquin Valley, where we continue to run a very efficient operation in that area. The strategy there has been a drill-to-fill strategy, so we're really utilizing the existing installed infrastructure base, and we see very good returns coming out of our San Joaquin area. Builds on our heavy oil expertise, and provides a very good return us to. So North America overall looks very strong in the onshore areas. Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Anish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please? Ryan Todd : Hey, everybody. Maybe a quick follow-up on the Delaware Basin. One of your competitors today talked about drilling laterals up to 15,000 to 20,000 feet in the Delaware. Can you talk about your general thoughts on lateral length, where you're trending right now in terms of where you've been pushing lateral length? And what you think about the ultimate extent of those efforts going forward? James William Johnson : Yeah. Thanks very much. It's a good question. And there are a lot of different things being tried in the Permian on a real-time basis. And, as I mentioned earlier, our strategy, we've been criticized for it maybe a little bit in the past, but it's proving to be a very good strategy, is to let some of the others do some of the experimentation and then we watch and see what performs well, and then build that into our basis of design. Right now, our focus is on 7500 to 10,000-foot laterals. We'll wait and see if those really turn out. But as you get longer and longer laterals, it gets very difficult to get good returns throughout the length of the well bore. So, our focus is on getting the ultimate return for the capital invested. And that's really what's going to drive us more than any other single parameter. Ryan Todd : Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up on some of the earlier comments and questions on free cash flow. It does look like there's \u2013 we're already seeing some amount of free cash flow, probably a greater inflection as we look into 2018. You've paid down a decent amount of debt this year. How should we think about your prioritizations for use of free cash as we go forward in terms of incremental capital, debt paydown, resumption of a share buyback, et cetera? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, Ryan, I'm going to go back and just reiterate our priorities that we've had. Dividend increase would be the first one, as soon as we can see our way clear to having a sustainable increase, meaning supported by cash flow and earnings. After that, it becomes the capital program, and where do we have incremental opportunity for investments there. You've heard about how strong an opportunity queue we've got sitting there in the Permian. We do want to keep a strong balance sheet. I think that's important, and it's particularly important being in the commodity cycle. And we've learned in the past that, when oil prices are high, it's good to shore up a little bit, and when oil prices are low, you use your balance sheet. And so we want to make sure that we're prepared through the thick and thin of the cycle. I do see share repurchases as the last use of cash, and I think those, at this point in time, with the view we have of commodity prices, et cetera, it's fairly remote for us. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please? Roger D. Read: Yeah. Thanks, good morning. Unknown Speaker : Morning, Roger. James William Johnson : Morning. Roger D. Read: Follow-up on the Permian. 20 rigs by the end of 2018 from 13 today, it seems, whether it's the Permian or other shales, comments from developers have been that you keep learning more the breakeven number of rigs to keep production flat, or to grow it at a higher rate, keeps declining, as well as breakeven prices. I was wondering, as you think about the 20 rigs, is that based on static knowledge today, or is that incorporating the idea of improving efficiencies, and that's part of how we should think about the range of 20% to 35% on the CAGR? James William Johnson : Yeah. So the 20 is really based on \u2013 we want to be bringing rigs in a steady, orderly fashion so that we can continue to increase the organizational capability around those rigs and make sure we're continuing to use each incremental rig very efficiently. So if you think about all the work that has to go on from establishing the land position, coring up, getting ready for the design of the development area, all through the procurement and then into the offtake afterwards, we want to make sure that we're keeping the organization and the factory healthy around each incremental rig. What we are finding is that, in addition to increasing the rigs, the amount of production each rig is generating is higher, and growing as the efficiencies improve. So part of it is increasing the rigs, but part of it is also getting more out of each and every rig that we apply. And the fleet is becoming more productive. So we're balancing all that. And as I say, because we get data on virtually a real-time basis, we're able to make decisions now and look forward and decide, do we want to continue that pathway higher or do we want to go ahead and hold at any number of particular rigs that we feel would deliver the efficiency? Capital's not the issue. It's really making sure that we're delivering the financial performance that we're looking for. Roger D. Read: Okay. I appreciate it. Patricia E. Yarrington: Hey. I think the... Roger D. Read: Could I ask you just one thing, Pat, real quick on the dividend? It's been modest growth the last couple years. And the earlier question about free cash flow allocation, just at what point do you think you'll have the confidence in say a flat $50 oil world to maybe move the dividend a little more aggressively? Patricia E. Yarrington: It's a Board call here and I think it's not just what current prices are but it's the outlook for future prices as well because it gets into a sustainable support level for the dividend that's important. So it's a combination of what's the commodity price outlook that we have, how are we seeing our capital program, how are we seeing cost structure, and as I said, we made tremendous strides over the last couple of years to get into a much more cash balanced position. And we're cognizant of our 29-year history and would love to be able to take it to a 30-year history but we're only going to do that when we have full confidence that it's a sustainable increase. Roger D. Read: Thanks. I'll bet on 30 though. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Okay. All right. I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please? Brendan Warn : Yeah. Thanks. I'll keep this short considering it's the last one. Just two-part question. I guess relating to Tengiz, you gave a bit of an update. Can you talk about the capital commitment to Tengiz? Obviously, it seems money buys a whole lot more today than it did 12 months ago and you're carrying quite a high contingency on that project. Can you just flag where that we should be seeing the CapEx coming for Tengiz? And then I've got a follow-up question, please. James William Johnson : Look, it's early days in terms of Tengiz. We carry good contingency and we make sure that when we run our economics, we really take into account what we think it could cost, not just what we want it to cost. We're taking all the steps we talked about in previous calls in terms of making sure the design assurance, our contracting strategies, our execution and our quality management are all in place. It's got our full and complete attention. So we're really working hard to manage this project. We're off to a good start. Projects of this nature are so large, there are always going be challenges and our goal is to address those challenges and minimize the use of contingency. But it's too early to give any other guidance than what we've given so far. Brendan Warn : Okay. My follow-up to Pat, and I guess it's in regards to the abilities of the Permian to deliver. That $17 billion to $22 billion and more focusing on the $17 billion, that soft floor, and I guess in around $50 a barrel Brent. I mean, how should we think about that $17 billion? Where could it potentially be considering what you're getting out of your short cycle investments now? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I think the best I can do is just say we're in the midst of our business planning cycle here and we'll come out with our C&E plan for the 2018 year around December. Typically, that's when we would do it after we've had a chance to go through the full business planning cycle. I don't have any different guidance other than to say what we've said. I mean, we are getting, for every dollar spent, Jay just went through it, for every dollar that we're spending we're getting much better response out of the Permian. So the capital efficiency per dollar is really increasing and that will all be taken into account as we're doing our revised planning. It is important for us to be cash balanced, this year with asset sales and next year without asset sales. And so those are primary objectives that we will be trying to balance as we put this next year's plan together. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks very much. I'd like to thank everybody for the time on the call today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and we appreciate everybody's questions on the call and participation. Thank you. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. ,",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead. John S. Watson: Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. Let me start by revisiting the three messages we delivered in March at our Analyst Day. First, we are growing free cash flow. Third quarter cash flow after dividends, excluding asset sales proceeds, was approximately $500 million. As shown on the chart, including asset sales proceeds, we generated $2.8 billion. Second, we're focused on improving project, book, and cash returns on investment. Projects are coming online, reducing pre-productive capital; and revenue is being realized from growing volumes. Spend is shifting to shorter cycle time, high return investments in base business and shale; and our cost structure is lower. Finally, we're focused on unlocking value from our advantaged and balanced portfolio of opportunities highlighted by legacy positions in Australia, Kazakhstan, and the Permian. Let me now turn the call over to Pat, who'll take you through the financials. I will follow her up with some operational updates and a few closing thoughts. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, John. Starting with slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. Third quarter earnings were $2 billion or $1.03 per diluted share. Included in the quarter was a gain on the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business of $675 million and charges associated with the project write-off of $220 million. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $112 million. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impact, earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $0.85 per share. Included in this total was a catch-up depreciation adjustment of about $220 million related to our Bangladesh Upstream business, which we have decided to retain. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.4 billion, reflecting continued strong Downstream performance and the impact of growing volumes and higher realizations in our Upstream business. A working capital draw benefited the quarter, but was mostly offset by an increase in notes receivables. Our debt ratio at quarter-end was just over 22%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 19%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we declared $1.08 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. We currently yield 3.6%. Turning to slide 5. During the quarter, net cash generated, after C&E and dividends, was $2.8 billion, including $2.3 billion in proceeds from asset sales. Year-to-date, net cash generation after dividends stands at $3.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $5.4 billion during the third quarter. It was a strong quarter despite approximately $600 million in pension contributions, and affiliate dividends being the lowest we've had this year. Year-to-date, cash from operations has totaled $14.3 billion. Lower affiliate dividends and earnings, working capital consumption of funds, and deferred tax effects, in the aggregate, totaled nearly $3.3 billion through the first nine months. Cash capital expenditures were $3.2 billion for the quarter, approximately $800 million lower than the third quarter 2016. Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures were $9.8 billion, over 30% lower than the same period a year ago. Third quarter asset sale proceeds were approximately $2.3 billion, reflecting the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business, select Central Basin Platform assets in the Permian, international interest in the Natuna Sea in Indonesia, and gas assets in Trinidad and Tobago. Year-to-date asset sales proceeds now total $4.9 billion. We are confident that we will exceed our objective of being cash balanced this year, including asset sales. Turning to slide 6 now. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2017 earnings were approximately $700 million higher than third quarter 2016 results. Special item, primarily a $675 million gain on the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business, offset by a project write-off of $220 million, and the absence of special items in the third quarter of 2016, increased earnings by $165 million. A swing in foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings between the periods by $184 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by about $800 million between periods. Higher realizations and increased volumes were partially offset by higher DD&A, both from the increased production and, as previously mentioned, from the catch-up adjustment in Bangladesh. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign-exchange increased by $55 million. Higher global refining margins were partially offset by a swing in timing effects, resulting from rising prices. If we turn now to slide 7. Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2017 and third quarter of 2016. Third quarter 2017 production was 2.72 million barrels per day, an increase of more than 200,000 barrels per day over the third quarter of 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 263,000 barrels per day, as we started and ramped up multiple projects, such as Gorgon and Angola LNG. Shale and tight production increased 39,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Lower planned turnaround effects, primarily at Tengiz, favorably impacted production between periods by 54,000 barrels per day. Base business growth of 44,000 barrels per day reflected additions from new wells, mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria. The impact of asset sales reduced production by 76,000 barrels per day, approximately 45,000 of which were due to 2017 asset sales that impacted third quarter production. Overall, production increases were partially offset by normal field declines and PSC effects. So, I'll now turn it back to John. John S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 8. Our production is growing, as major capital projects come online, the Permian ramps up, and we manage declines in our base operations. At the beginning of the year, we said that production, excluding the effects of 2017 asset sales, would be up 4% to 9% from 2016. At nine months, production before current-year asset sales is up approximately 6% in the middle of the range. We now expect the full-year growth to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The bar on the right shows year-to-date production including the impact of 15,000 barrels a day in 2017 asset sales. We completed our final shallow-water GoM transaction; that's in the Gulf of Mexico. We sold certain Permian properties and divested international interest in Trinidad and the Natuna Sea in Indonesia. We now expect the impact of 2017 asset sales for the full year to be 30,000 barrels a day. As Pat noted, we've canceled the sale of our Bangladesh gas business. Turning to slide 9. Gorgon continues to ramp up. Total production was more than 400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We finished a successful maintenance pit stop on Train 1 in early October. The three trains are currently averaging well above nameplate capacity. As we fine-tune the plans to enhance reliability and improve volumes, we'll likely have intermittent downtime on other occasions. At Wheatstone, we announced first LNG production from Train 1 on October 9 and are currently ramping up at 65% of capacity. Loading arms are connected, and we're in the process of loading the first cargo. We expect production to ramp up to full rates over the quarter. We have scheduled downtime to remove temporary strainers in December. Upstream well performance for both projects is at or above expectations. First LNG for Wheatstone Train 2 is scheduled for the second quarter next year. Now, let's turn to the Permian on slide 10. Unconventional production in the Permian continues to exceed expectation. Volume was 187,000 barrels a day in the third quarter, up 30% from third quarter a year ago. Our new basis of design is proving quite effective, and we're standing up our 15th operated rig. A proprietary database contains over 5 million well attributes, encompassing most Permian wells. We continue to apply data analytics and petrophysical technology to that information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. Volume growth is one outcome of our activity. Of course, the more important outcome is the return we generate on the money spent to achieve this volume growth. Earlier this year, we indicated our IRRs on Permian investments were more than 30% at $50 a barrel WTI. I thought it'd be helpful to share information from some recent appropriation requests approved under the new basis of design, and we show that on slide 11. These are fully loaded cost economics. On the left are the operating and financial parameters for three pads currently being developed with 10,000 foot laterals. Based on our type curves and costs, we expect to recover an average of about 1.9 million barrels per well with $14 per barrel capital, operating, and overhead expenditures. At $50 a barrel WTI, $2.50 Henry Hub, and $25 a barrel NGLs, revenue from oil, condensate, and gas streams will weight average $33 per barrel. Our realizations are advantaged by our legacy royalty position and add to strong returns. As you can see by the chart on the right, the typical profile of cumulative cash flow from production allows capital to be recovered very quickly. We expect the average time from initial investment to payback to be about 28 months, and cumulative cash flow over the life of the pad to be nearly two times the capital cost. This is very good use of your money. Capital and operating expenses continue to trend down. Capital expenditures average $4.5 billion per quarter this year, down by more than half from three years ago. Following the normal intra-year pattern, fourth quarter spend will be higher, but we expect full-year capital expenditures will be less than $19 billion. We're also controlling operating and administrative expense as well. Average quarterly costs are down again this year, about $450 million per quarter lower than last year, despite higher Upstream production and 22% lower than 2014. We expect unit cost in the Upstream to continue the downward trend. Turning to slide 13. Last year, I indicated we plan to sell $5 billion to $10 billion worth of assets in 2016 and 2017 combined. Through seven quarters, we've sold $7.7 billion, squarely in the middle of the range. In the third quarter, we closed the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business and the Upstream assets I noted earlier. We expect no significant asset sales in the fourth quarter. In South Africa, our minority shareholders exercised their right of first refusal and plan to purchase our refining and marketing assets there. We now expect this sale to close in 2018. Our criteria for asset sales hasn't changed and is listed on the chart. Before taking your question, I'll offer a few closing thoughts. As you know, I've announced my retirement effective February 1, so this'll be my last earnings call. The financial community judges CEOs by TSR, and I'm gratified that we outperformed our peers during my tenure. That's an outcome my two predecessors established as a precedent, and we certainly owe much of our success in this long-cycle time business to those that came before us. During my time we're seen tremendous volatility in price and cost conditions. On my first day on the job, back in 2010, oil was $80 a barrel and Henry Hub was over $6 per MCF. Today, of course, prices are much lower, and that's impacted industry results and produced TSRs that have lagged the S&P 500 Index. But the company has weathered the downturn, adjusted rapidly to new conditions, and is well-positioned for the future. Including our fourth quarter declared dividend of $1.08, we've now increased the annual per-share cash payout 30 years in a row, a record that is very important to us. We've also repurchased shares when it was prudent and have been conscious not to dilute the share count. As you've seen in the results, we're at a cash flow inflection point, with spending coming down and revenue from growing production going up. With the fourth quarter at current prices, we should be close to cash balanced without asset sales proceeds this year. We have an Upstream business that I believe can sustain itself at current prices, thanks to an enviable unconventional position highlighted but not limited to the Permian. I expect Australia will deliver earnings and cash flow for decades, and we've had a successful record developing a huge resource base in Kazakhstan. We have a tightly configured high-return Downstream and Chemical business that complements the Upstream. Most importantly, we've got a wonderful management team, organization, and culture. You know Mike Wirth and his team well. They're typical of the talented and effective people that make up our 50,000 employees. Mike has a track record of success, and I know he'll do an outstanding job for you. With that, I'll take your questions. So, Jonathan, please open the lines for those questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of James (sic) [Jason] Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please. Jason Gammel : Yeah. I think that's me, folks. Hi, everyone. John S. Watson: Jason. Jason Gammel : First of all, John, I'd like to congratulate you \u2013 thanks. First of all, John, I'd like to congratulate you on your highly successful tenure as CEO. You left things in great shape for Mike. And as a former Chevron guy, I've got a strong appreciation for the mark you've left on the company, so best wishes in all your future endeavors. John S. Watson: Thank you much, Jason. Jason Gammel : First question, John. Pretty significant major milestones achieved over the quarter, with first LNG startup at Wheatstone, Gorgon at full economic capacity. Now, that you're transitioning from construction to operation, can you talk a little bit about some of the lessons that you've learned since you embarked on this big expansion in Australia, given that it spanned most of your tenure? John S. Watson: Sure. Jason, there are a lot of lessons we've learned. We went to FID back in 2009 on this project. And a lot of the engineering work was done 10 years ago; a lot of the project planning work was done 10 years ago. And I think it's fair to say, we, in the industry, have learned a number of things during that time. I think the real lessons are around the assurance work we need to do and the preparatory work. We had a lot of reviews of, say, Gorgon when we started. And it was labeled by independent reviewers, the best prepared mega-project out there. And it's pretty clear that we needed to do more engineering in advance, and we needed to have better assurance work on some of the project planning and other aspects of the project. It's a complex project on Barrow Island. And if you miss a few things, you're going to incur some additional costs. So, we've learned from that and learned from what we've done and others have done. And we've tried to make some of those changes going forward on projects like FGP and elsewhere. So, there certainly have been learnings. And I think in a broad sense, we have to verify every single aspect of these projects in advance, because we're on the hook for them, regardless of the kind of contract that we sign. So, if a vendor or a contractor doesn't perform, or there's some element that we've not thoroughly vetted, and during construction, we have to verify these things. We have to be sure that what we order gets delivered. We have to be sure that the designs are robust. We have to be sure of everything. And I think we had a different mindset going back a decade ago. Jason Gammel : That's great. And it's actually a good segue to my follow-up question. Thanks for the financial data on the Permian. With the baseline moving into more of a manufacturing mode, can you talk a little bit about the advantages that scale and the strong balance sheet give you relative to smaller competitors? John S. Watson: Sure. When you look at the Permian and you look at Chevron, we have a portfolio of products. So, we're generating cash flow from each individual investment that we make in the Permian. But that's a team effort, really. We have a strong procurement organization. We have a technical organization that supports our people in the Permian. And we have learnings that we're generating. We've talked a lot about data science, but there's more to it than that, that's enabling us to learn from others, so that we can really spend our money very efficiently. We showed some charts last quarter that showed how we process the information from others. And we think we came up with the learning curve pretty fast. We're drilling fewer wells. And it's that kind of capability that I think is advantageous to us. Also, we have a portfolio, where different assets have different roles. For example, right now, we can choose to pace how much we spend in the Permian. I showed you a chart that showed the kinds of returns that we have there, so we can scale that. We're continuing on our ramp up to 20 rigs, but we have the ability to ramp that up and really manage the cash flow as a portfolio. Overall, my view is the work we do, whether it's procurement or advantage royalty position, the integration that we have with our supply and trading organization, the technology, all those things are something that a big company can bring. And I think we're showing that in the results that we've been metering out to you, guys, every quarter. Frank Mount : Thanks, Jason. Jason Gammel : I agree with that. All the best, John. John S. Watson: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. Frank Mount : Hey, Paul. John S. Watson: Hey, Paul. Paul Sankey : John, we first met a long time ago, when you were the CFO. And I just want to thank you for the time and the patience you showed in dealing with guys like me, and congratulate you on your retirement. We really can't argue with shareholder return as a measure, so enjoy. You've got me slightly fantasizing about retiring myself, but unfortunately, it's a long way off. With all that said, John, this result was pretty weak, if we look at cash flow, if we look at EPS, if we look at volumes. If we could just focus perhaps \u2013 and by the way, there was a tremendous positive element here, which was the Permian slides. But if we could just focus on the cash flow, is there anything that you would highlight that made it look as weak as it did? Because I think we were a bit negatively surprised, quite frankly. John S. Watson: Yeah. I saw how the stock opened, and I must say I was surprised, because underneath that I think we're doing pretty well. And so, it won't surprise you, Paul, if we have a little bit of a disagreement on this. But, in fairness, not all of it was apparent to you in the numbers. So, let me talk through a couple of things, and I'll also let Pat make a comment. On earnings, earnings were $0.85 a share. We didn't call the Bangladesh catch-up depreciation adjustment a special item. Basically, what happens here is when you declare an asset that's going to be sold, you suspend depreciation. When you decide not to sell it, you have to reinstate it, so that was some $220 million. We terminated a rig contract, which is $150 million before tax, and so that appeared in the numbers. We've also got some things going on in working capital that don't impact earnings per se. And I'm going to let Pat walk you through a couple of those. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, two things on the cash flow side I would mention is, one, the pension contribution. I called out a number of $600 million in total, but $500 million of that was discretionary, and the first one that we've made in \u2013 all year, so that is a quarterly impact. $600 million in total, $500 discretionary. The second thing I would mention is \u2013 and we did mention it here, but we did have a circumstance where one of our partners \u2013 as you might expect over the last three years, there's been some difficulty in some of our partners actually paying us what they owe us. So, during the quarter, we were successful in negotiating more security around that ultimate payment, but it meant having a swap between what was the current receivable into a notes receivable. So, you ended up having a positive working capital effect in the quarter of about $600 million as we recognized this reclassification from a accounts receivable to a notes receivable. So, when you look at our 10-Q statement, and you look at what's happened in notes receivable, you will see there was no cash flow impact during the quarter for that. It did impact working capital, however. John S. Watson: So, what you're saying is the working capital adjustment is a touch misleading... Patricia E. Yarrington: It is. John S. Watson: ...during the quarter. And really the news was good, because we were able to provide better security around arrear and arrear from one of our national company partners. Patricia E. Yarrington: So, if you kind of look through that, you're really talking about our cash from operations, I think, on a headline basis and adding back the $500 million discretionary pension contribution. That gets you close to a $6 billion figure. Paul Sankey : Great. And, John, in all sincerity, thanks, and congratulations. John S. Watson: Paul, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. And, John, congratulations. John S. Watson: Thank you. Neil Mehta : John, first, a big picture question. The energy sector broadly hasn't created a lot of value over the last 10 years. Now, a lot of that has to do with commodity price, but a lot of that has to do with capital allocation. Your stock has been one of the better performers. So, sort of handing off the baton question, what's your message to the CEOs of the energy industry, whether it's the next-generation of major CEOs, many of which would come from Downstream or the shale E&Ps. John S. Watson: Yeah, if you look at our TSR since I started, just under 10%, but that's lagged the S&P which, of course, gets heavily weighted by the FANG stocks. But there's no getting away from the fact that I think we missed on the commodity side which was largely a miss on technology. If you look at miracle of hydraulic fracturing that's taken place really since 2010, that's put supply on the market that we didn't anticipate. And so, I think the message really is that we're a pretty resilient bunch in this business. And when prices go up, technology keeps moving, and we're able to respond to that very well as an industry. So, never underestimate that ingenuity, if you will, because we're very, very good at what we do. Our industry doesn't get a lot of attention as a technology industry, but clearly, we have been, and that resulted in a transition. So, we are in a commodity price business. We really have to focus on the lowest-cost projects and opportunities that we have regardless of the ups and downs that we'll see on a transitory basis in the commodity market. I suspect, Neil, that if we had commodity prices that were in the range that most of us anticipated, we would all have performed a lot better. And the message is be a little bit wiser about the quantity of projects that you take on; be very wary of the capabilities in the supply chain during those busy times that I commented on earlier; and pursue your best opportunities. And that's what we are doing right now. You know well, we talk a lot about the Permian. But Vaca Muerta, you've seen a little bit in the press, is performing very well. The Duvernay for us is good, the Marcellus. We've got four big shale opportunities that are very low cost. We've got continuing base business opportunities. And we're trying to drive down the costs in some of the longer cycle time projects. But the emphasis will be on getting a lot out of the assets that we have, particularly during this period, where commodity prices are \u2013 maybe lower than many have anticipated. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that, John. And then follow-up just around 2018 CapEx. Recognizing you're going to give us more color here in a couple of weeks with the December capital spending release, but just how are you thinking about the drivers going into 2018 relative to the $17 billion to $22 billion band that's out there? John S. Watson: Yeah. We indicated that if prices stayed in the kind of \u2013 near $50 range that we would be toward the bottom of that $17 billion top $22 billion range. And I see no reason to modify that guidance. That will certainly be the case. A couple of things I'll highlight for next year, and it'll be \u2013 we've got our plan approved in early December, I expect. And we'd put out a C&E release after that. Next year will be the peak year. Next year, 2018/2019 will be the peak spending time for the future growth project in Kazakhstan, and of course, we'll continue to fund the Permian. But nothing has changed that will drive us away from the bottom \u2013 toward the bottom of that range. Neil Mehta : Thanks, John. Good luck with your handicap. John S. Watson: Thanks. Frank Mount : Thanks, Neil. John S. Watson: Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please? Phil M. Gresh: Yes. Good morning. And I echo everybody's sentiments. Congratulations, John. John S. Watson: Thanks, Phil. Phil M. Gresh: First question is just, as I look at the production trends over the past couple of quarters, if you look at that base plus shale piece, it's been pretty flattish. And I think at the analyst day, you actually expected it to be more like minus 2% this year. And it would take a couple years for that to get to kind of a 0 to plus 1% trendline. So, maybe you could just elaborate on why you've been able to outperform that base plus shale expectation? And how do you roll that forward and think about the outlook for the next few years? John S. Watson: Well, I think the outlook is nothing but good. If I think about, first, the base business, our people are very focused on getting the most out of the assets that they have, so certainly, that has been a positive. And so, with infill drilling program, development well drilling off of our hosts in deep water, et cetera, has been very successful for us. So, that is certainly a positive. And then you see the Permian and shale results have been good. So, I made a comment in my closing remarks that I think we're sustainable for a good period of time at lower prices. And that was sort of a code for what you're describing. I think we'll be in a position to grow production for a period of years, just from the shale, frankly, and the projects that are continuing to come online and ramp up. So, I think that's very positive. We'll go through our normal cycle with you, where on the fourth quarter earnings call, we'll give you an estimate for production for next year. But I think looking forward, with the continuing ramp-up of major capital projects and the success we're seeing in the Permian and elsewhere, it'll be a good news story. Phil M. Gresh: Okay. Thanks. Second question just on the dividend, obviously, acknowledging the long-term track record. I think some investors maybe were a little bit surprised not to see a modest bump with the dividend in the fourth quarter, as we lap last year's fourth-quarter tweak up. So, maybe you could just share your thoughts on that in the context of the broader picture? John S. Watson: Sure. I said in my closing remarks, we like the dividend, and we like it a lot. The board likes it, and every member of management that I know likes increasing the dividend. And you've heard me overtime, we've said we'll increase it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. I've also said that we want to be sure that any increase in the dividend is ultimately sustainable. I said, I wouldn't knowingly increase the dividend if I didn't think we could sustain it in perpetuity. So, we put a high bar on increases. And I'll say, the story inside the company is very good. We chose not to increase the dividend this quarter, in large part, based on the time of year that it is and the potential risks that we see in the marketplace in the fourth quarter and early part of next year. There's uncertainty around OPEC, and there's just always uncertainty in the marketplace. Having said that, if you look at where prices are today, it may have been a conservative call, to be honest. But the great thing about the dividend is we get an opportunity to reconsider it every 90 days. And so, our board will take a close look at it every quarter. And I'll remind everyone that we've increased it 30 years in a row, the annual per share cash payout. And I expect that, that'll be a priority going forward. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil. Phil M. Gresh: Thanks, John. Congratulations. John S. Watson: Phil, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, John. Good morning, everybody. And John, I'm going to add my congratulations also. I'm in the same generation as (31:40) CFO timeline. So, thanks for putting up with us for the last 15 years. We really appreciate it. John S. Watson: All good, Doug. Doug Leggate : It looks like you're going out on a high with oil price above $60, but relatively speaking anyway. All right, so two questions, both high-level, John. I'm going to apologize for not asking any specifics about the quarter, but your legacy has been to establish or maybe be the \u2013 you kind of managed through the establishment of a very large legacy asset base, this obviously driving this inflation in cash flow. Mike's worst (32:18) track record has been something of a cost-cutting asset sales generator in the Downstream. I'm just wondering, given the succession planning on the continuity of strategy, with the flexibility in the Permian, how do you see those two things coming together as Mike steps? And what I'm really getting at is do you think there's an opportunity for a more aggressive resizing of Chevron's portfolio, given that those major changes have taken place? And I've got a follow up, please. John S. Watson: Yeah, Doug, that is a broad question. And I think it's certainly true that during my tenure, we've had some significant capital projects, and we've seen a wild ride in the commodity cycle markets. I do think those investments give Chevron a lot to work on. I'd describe it internally as we have a lot to chew on over the next few years. So, what do I mean by that? What it means is Gorgon and Wheatstone, for example, we have to ramp those up, fine-tune them, get the most out of those young assets and then debottleneck them over time. So, I would describe that as sort of a base business type activity. We have a Permian business that has a lot of momentum behind it. And we have other assets, other fresh assets, that have been or will be coming online that will give us a lot to work on for incremental returns over time. And those incremental efforts and outlays of capital will, in general, be smaller. And they'll likely have higher returns, because they're building off existing infrastructure. So, I think it's a wonderful opportunity. And certainly Mike is very familiar with that, because one of the things the Downstream business has done well, all downstreamers have done, and Mike did an exceptional job, is really they've been penny-pinchers in that sense. And they've learned how to eke more out of the refineries. And I think that's exactly what we want to do with our assets. But I think it undersells Mike to describe him as just a cost-cutter, because actually, there have been opportunities to grow in the Downstream business that we've taken advantage of over time. And I think that Mike has been a part of our leadership team, my leadership team, for a long time. He's been in leadership positions elsewhere, so there will be elements of growth likely over his period of time. But I don't think it will be \u2013 whether it was Mike or somebody else, I don't think it would be this big period of additions to the capital base that I went through. But I would encourage you to think about Mike as being certainly great at grinding returns out of the business, but also very balanced in his capabilities. You got a chance to talk to him. You know he's a very broad guy. Doug Leggate : Well, we're looking forward to it. But we'll miss you just the same, John. So, my follow up is \u2013 I'm going to have a little fun with you now, because I think as you walk away, I think you've been quoted multiple times as the prospect of peak oil demand, I think, wishful thinking is probably, putting it kindly, as to what your response was. I wonder if I could just ask you as you walk away to offer your thoughts on the commodity outlook and this concept of peak oil demand that seems to be current fashion. John S. Watson: Sure. Well, I just try to speak factually about what I see out there. And I am an unabashed advocate for our industry. Our industry is responsible for the greatest advancements in living standard in recorded history. And literally, light, heat, mobility, mechanized agriculture, everything that we have, every shred of our standard of living, has been provided by our industry, if you look back 100 years ago. So, that's the context in the statements that I make. And the comments on demand are simply, I'm just repeating what the International Energy Administration and others state. In fact, if you look at our demand forecast going forward, they're very similar to those of our competitors'. So, when people talk about peak oil, they're simply not looking at facts and data for the foreseeable future. Now, technology advances, and that's a good thing. And there will be other forms of energy that will come into the energy mix. But I think good debate on energy policy starts with a good grounding of the facts. And peak oil will happen at some point. But for the foreseeable future, as the developing world puts in place economic systems to generate the kind of standard of living that we have and the infrastructure that's associated with it, it's pretty clear that oil demand is going to grow. In fact, demand estimates for next year are up again. We're getting close to 100 million barrels a day. Natural gas demand is growing and our products are needed. And we have to be able to provide them in an environmentally safe way and an environmentally responsible way, but we really ought to have deeper debate on these subjects based on a well-grounded set of facts. And so, that's where I come from when I make the kind of comments that I do. Frank Mount : Thank you, Doug. Doug Leggate : I appreciate your viewpoint. Thanks again. Good luck, John. John S. Watson: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Your question, please. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Frank Mount : Hey, Paul. Paul Cheng : John, I want to add my congratulations. John S. Watson: Thank you. Paul Cheng : I think that you make me feel really old because I think I met you more than 20 years ago, so that has been... John S. Watson: Yeah. Paul Cheng : ...a wild ride. So, really appreciate that. John S. Watson: You're seasoned. You're seasoned, Paul. You're not old. Paul Cheng : That is a very nice term. But anyway, really want to say congratulations, and thank you for putting up with all the nasty (38:05). I really appreciate it. So, with that, maybe I have two questions. First, if we look at the industry, we've been nearly constantly going through the boom and bust. Partly, it's probably related to the normal commodity cycle, which naturally that is going to have volatility like that. But I'm wondering, you said also partly is because the industry, how it is being managed or that is being compensate. So, I mean, as you're departing and go to the retirement, John, when you look at the industry, do you think the way to how it's being managed or how it's being compensate need to be changed, or with the cycle, it's just naturally going to be here and not much can be done? John S. Watson: Well, I think that's, in many ways, a company-specific question, because if you look at our comp system, we've had a pretty balanced compensation system for a long time. And for those that aren't aware, there are really four big components to it. One is a salary that's based on competitive data. Two is a current year cash bonus, which is based on a scorecard. And I would invite anyone to take a look at Chevron's scorecard. And it has a variety of things in it, including returns in that scorecard, and so, whether it's health, environment, and safety project progress and things of that sort. Now, we've enhanced our disclosure on that in recent years, but I think it sets a standard. So, that's for the current year cash bonus. And then we have two other long-term components that really are 100% aligned with shareholder return. The first is a relative TSR performance unit. And just last year, we added the S&P 500 as one of our competitors. But that is married up with, what for the most part in the past has been, options that have been given, which again, is lined with absolute shareholder performance over time. And the thinking behind those components for us has been that you will have these ups and downs. And so, if in an absolute sense, we don't perform well, options won't return much. If in a relative way, we outperform all of our competitors, we'll get that component. But if the downtime for the industry, you won't realize value from the options. And so, it's really quite balanced, but it's very returns-focused, whether it's TSR-focused or returns-focused in the scorecard for the current year, along with other current-year performance information. The outcomes that we've achieved have largely been a function of the commodity price environment. We made $26 billion when oil was high, and we made nothing when oil was $42. And so it's been a volatile ride. But if you look at those components together over time, I think ours has been a good system. I think there's a wide range out there in industry. And, look, I read the same articles you do. And I've read some of the proxies and some of the information that other companies put out there. And I think you're seeing a response to that by shareholders and by management. Paul Cheng : The second one, don't know whether you want to comment, but seems that you're retiring, you may. What would be your advice to the high official in a number of oil-producing countries? The way they \u2013 how they manage the industry and \u2013 or how the oil revenue is being \u2013 I mean, not to mention how oil revenue is being managed inside, but how their relationship with the oil industry, and how they can do better in terms of attracting the investment dollar? John S. Watson: Well, Paul, as you know, I mean, we talk a lot about the strain on the private companies, like Chevron, during this period of lower prices and the adjustment we've had to make. And I've said on previous calls, host governments are going through the exact same type of change. The difference is we have dividends; they have social spending as commitments that they have. And so, they're wrestling with lower revenues, they've made commitments to their people, and they've got trade-offs to make. And so, I think they're in the process of making those trade-offs. The advice would only be that it's a competitive world out there, and so when I talk to heads of state or governments, we are economic agents and we respond to the incentives that are out there, so putting in place a system that's going to draw capital, be viewed as stable over time is very important. And we're seeing some countries that are responding to that. We're seeing others that aren't. And when they don't respond, when it's not economic, private companies walk with their feet. And so these transitions can take time because of these trade-offs that governments have between keeping the cash and not adjusting the fiscal terms and adjusting the terms to draw capital, so that we can make the kind of long-term investments that'll deliver benefits over a longer period of time for their country. And so, those are the things that I think have to be considered. And most governments eventually gets there. Paul Cheng : Well, congratulation, and hope you have a lot of fun in your retirement. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. John S. Watson: Thank you. Appreciate it, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please? Doug Terreson : Well, first, John, congratulations on your stock beating every peer during your... John S. Watson: Thanks, Doug. Doug Terreson : ...tenure and over 5 and 10 years. But I don't think you need any help with your handicap. John S. Watson: Thanks, Doug. Doug Terreson : I think that's pretty good. So, my question is, Chevron had this pledge to focus on returns on capital employed and free cash flow, which you guys highlight on page 3. And it's had a long history of positive shareholder outcomes. Simultaneously though, a lot of times, investment discipline will falter as surplus capital materializes. And Chevron looks likely to have a lot of surplus capital during the next couple of years. So, my question is how significant do you consider the challenge to manage this transition to be? And besides some of the commentary that you and Pat made on spending and distributions, are there any other thing that we should focus on which underscore Chevron's commitment to value creation going forward? John S. Watson: I don't want to advertise that my successor's going to have an easy time, because there will be challenges that the industry will face going forward. But I think we're in a good place right now, because we do have projects coming online and more that are coming. They are going to deliver cash flow. I actually think that there's a very high chance that we'll be very disciplined for a whole variety of reasons. One, the opportunity set that we have tends to be shorter-cycle opportunities that we've highlighted by the shale. Second, if you compare the current period with the period, say, 10 years ago, we knew we had a number of major capital project opportunities coming up and that were in the hopper. And I won't relive the history of timing of funding of Gorgon and Wheatson, Jack/St. Malo and some of the other large projects that we have had, but we clearly don't have that array of gigantic projects coming up. We are funding in a counter-cyclical way, the FGP project, in a place we've been very successful in Kazakhstan. But the number of projects that we have going forward, the die is reasonably well cast over the next few years. In other words, there's not some $20 billion or $30 billion project expenditure that's progressed to the point that would likely get funded during this period. So, I think the discipline will be pretty clear. And, in fact, Mike will have the opportunity to give you an update on that capital spending range at our normal meeting in March. Doug Terreson : Okay. Well, listen, Chevron is set up well. Congratulations, again, John. John S. Watson: Thank you very much, Doug. Frank Mount : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Evan Calio : Hey, good afternoon. John S. Watson: Hey, Evan. Evan Calio : I want to congratulate both Mike, I'm sure he is listening, and echo the congratulations, John, on your tenure. It's been a pleasure working with you, and I wish you the best. John S. Watson: Thank you, Evan. Evan Calio : My first question, bigger picture. I know, John, you've been a strategic thinker. You've been involved in acquisitions of Unocal, as well as the Chesapeake acreage and others. I think last month, Chevron made a compelling case that the majors can really win in unconventionals. And my question is what do you think that the U.S. shale industry structure looks like in five years? I know it's less necessary for Chevron, but do you think that, that industry will significantly consolidate over time, or any thoughts there would be interesting. John S. Watson: I do expect there to be some consolidation. I think a lot of the work that's going on now, a lot of the land work that's taking place certainly for us, but for many others as well is, we call it coring up, but it's really making sure that you've got contiguous acreage positions, so that you can drill up the kinds of laterals that you want to drill, put in place the infrastructure that you want, so that you can deliver good returns very efficiently. And so, I do think that there will be that focus. And we're engaged in a number of different \u2013 I mean, frankly, we've got dozens of different transactions that are under way to do just that, and we've highlighted that. One of them will be broader consolidation. I think it depends a lot on valuations. Now, valuations have come back into line recently, so it may create some of that opportunity. From our way of thinking, when it comes to M&A, we like the positions we've had. I've made it pretty clear in the past that we don't have to do any particular acquisition at this time, but at the same time, I've also said that we're in a resource business. And so, whether it's adding volume through exploration, discovered resource, or M&A, we'll likely participate in all those things. And so, if there were a bolt-on opportunity, we'd consider it. But it really would be driven by, how does it fit? I mean, the question I always ask our people when we do M&A is, what do we know that the market doesn't, and how can we add value that wasn't contemplated here. And so, anytime we would engage in a transaction, I would encourage you to ask us that question, because that's the question that we ask ourselves. Evan Calio : Great. And John, there's always room for a Watson's pack (49:07) out there, if you choose to follow your peers and not work on the handicap. My second question is on the Permian, more detailed in your slide 11. Can you give any color on what percentage of your 2017 or 2018 programs will be this new well design? And any indication on how that affects your guidance, which I presume was predicated on the prior completion design? John S. Watson: I think it's virtually all of it is under this new design. We've been migrating to that design. This chart, I hope, was helpful to you, because it's really three pads that we've had. And we monitor the type curves and the performance against them. These are 10,000 foot laterals. There are some that won't necessarily be 10,000-foot laterals, but that's certainly what we're striving for in most areas. Evan Calio : Got it. Good luck. Thank you John S. Watson: Okay. Thank you, Evan. Frank Mount : Thanks, Evan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please. Roger D. Read: Yeah. Good morning, and congratulations, John. It's certainly been a solid run. John S. Watson: Thanks, Roger. Roger D. Read: Hey. I just wanted to follow up. Pat, this actually maybe a question more for you. In the presentation, the change in depreciation, which I'm sure is driven mostly by Gorgon and the coming Wheatstone, is that accurate? And is that the right way to think about \u2013 obviously, a little less large, but the impacts of Wheatstone coming forward as well? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, a lot of it would be production volumetrically related. I do call you back to the Bangladesh depreciation catch-up component that was in there in this quarter for $220 million. But the fundamental underlying components are going to be related to volumetric increases that we've had quarter-to-quarter. It depends on which period you're looking at. Third-to-third, of course, up significantly. Second to third is not exactly the same scenario, but that's where the Bangladesh catch-up shows itself. Roger D. Read: Okay. Great. And then as a follow up to that, as we think about the slide on the Permian and all, and obviously, very attractive F&D and ultimate depreciation cost there, does that trend down overall for the company, or is the Permian not likely to be large enough for that to be the case over the next couple of years? John S. Watson: Yeah, let me think. Overall, there's a balance between depreciation that's coming on from the new projects from Gorgon and Wheatstone, which we've said are largely between $20 and $25 a barrel; and then the ramping down of depreciation that's taking place in the Permian and unconventional business. And I flagged that last quarter going down from, say, $19 a barrel down to $13, and frankly even lower than that, as we move forward with this new base of design and more volumes at lower cost coming into the mix. Maybe I'll defer on what the exact number will be each year, and we can come back to a little bit of guidance in that way. We haven't... Patricia E. Yarrington: Finished our... John S. Watson: We haven't finalized our plan, but you're correct that it's a weight between those two. Roger D. Read: Okay. That's great. Thank you. John S. Watson: Yeah. Frank Mount : Thanks, Roger. John S. Watson: Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons. Your question, please. Guy Baber : Good morning, everybody. And, John, just echoing everyone else's comments, congrats on a great run here. John S. Watson: Thank you much. Guy Baber : I wanted to circle back to the CapEx kind of framework. But as we think about the level of spending right now going to your base upstream assets, so setting aside your shale and type (53:01) program and the spending associated with major projects, how comfortable are you with the current spending level for those assets just in terms of sufficiency to sustain the base? And really, just trying to understand if you see a need to step up that base spending level or not, given the efficiencies, which you seem to continue to realize, and maybe how much flexibility there might be with oil prices where they are right now. John S. Watson: Well, if you look at the base level spend, it's been \u2013 we've categorized it, excluding the major capital projects that are part of that base, it's been about $6 billion a year. So, we've been kind of at the bottom of that range. In our guidance going forward, we will have projects that will be associated with some of these new assets. So, you'll call that base \u2013 there will be base level of spend. Some of these base projects are not trivial in the sense that some of the deep water well programs that are off existing hosts and things like that are there. But I think what you'll see is a higher component, a higher percentage of our spend will be in the category of base and shale type spend going forward. In terms of the precise number, maybe we'll defer until we give you that \u2013 we'll give you that usual split that we do in March, but the general trend is in the direction that you described. And certainly, it's driven by economics. Guy Baber : Okay. That's great. And then at the risk of getting into the weeds here, on cash flow, as we dial in our 2018 cash flow and free cash flow expectations, just in light of some of the year-to-date headwinds, can you speak at all to some of those less-obvious drivers of free cash flow next year that might be hard for us to see but important to consider? And just thinking if there's any high-level observations perhaps around the evolution of deferred tax or potential tax refunds, given where oil prices are right now, necessary contributions to TCO that might or may not be needed. And maybe even a step down in pension payments next year, given the discretionary contribution. But just wondering if you can put any color there. John S. Watson: Yeah, let me make an overall comment about cash flow. There often are some things that are difficult to see. We've given you guidance on how sensitive we are to oil prices, for example. And we've said it's $350 million per $1, but the devil's in the detail on that, and particularly, depending upon the range of prices that it's covering. For example, right now, if we happen to have negative taxable income, the leverage is higher in a particular jurisdiction. So, I think that's part of why we've said that we are exposed to the upside to commodity prices. But we do have \u2013 I do urge some caution in the sense that we have a major affiliate, for example, in Kazakhstan that is incurring spending that runs through the affiliate and that can impact dividend or capital contributions to that company. It's not the normal consolidated operations, so those kinds of things can impact us. And Pat can make a couple of other comments. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I'd just say, if you're thinking about the future, I mean, pension contributions we look at every year. At least in terms of the U.S. pension plan, we're not in a statutory requirement to make a funding. But in the past, you will see over time that we have up to $500 million, or in healthier days spent $1 billion per year. So, that is a consideration that we will look at every year, but it's completely discretionary. John mentioned the affiliate component of things. The other one that I would highlight on a deferred tax basis, we have been in a position where our deferred tax has been a headwind for us this year and in the last couple of years. As I look forward, obviously, prices will be a huge impact as to when those, in fact, reverse. But if you look at reasonable price ranges around what we've had here, in the $50s, say, I think you should anticipate that that will take some time for that cash benefit to come back into our actual cash coffers. So, it will be a bleed out over time, where the net operating losses that are creating these tax cash carry-forwards, in fact, get monetized. But it's a pretty slow bleed-off if you're looking at prices around today's. John S. Watson: Thanks, Guy. Guy Baber : Yeah, thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. And I'll echo all those before me in passing on my congratulations, John. It's been great, and good luck with what's next. John S. Watson: Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Maybe a question. You've touched a little bit on this on various questions earlier, but a number of your integrated peers, including your U.S. peer who also reported this morning, have been relatively active over the last couple years in global asset markets acquiring resources in global LNG, Brazil, or various locations. You guys have remained relatively on the sidelines through most of this. I mean, can you talk about how your thinking about managing investment priorities, not just for the next few years, but also how you view in terms of how your portfolio is positioned post-2020, and whether your decision to kind of stay on the sidelines through much of this over the last couple years represents \u2013 is it just portfolio positioning relative to what you think you have, or is it a slight shift in investment philosophy longer-term? John S. Watson: Well, I think it's been a couple of things, Ryan. One is, as you say, it's the portfolio. We've got a very good portfolio. We've got 1.5 million acres in the Permian; we've got a lot to do and to digest there and the other unconventional positions. So, we have a good resource base position. And we have growth ahead over the next few years, as we continue to bring on these projects and develop them and grow the shale. So, one, we do have a good position. As you point out, you do have to add resource over time, and that's why I made the comment that I did earlier. But I'll tell you, we look at what's going to compete for capital in the portfolio against the opportunities that we have. And for much of this time period, over the last few years, there's been, let's say, an imbalance between the expectations of buyers and sellers. And so, you can't always reach commercial agreement, or you may just see things that are out of the money. And so, we've been very cognizant of that. Now, I highlighted earlier that \u2013 and I've said in previous calls that we have a watching brief on a lot of different opportunities, whether they're asset-level transactions or companies. And so, we do watch that very carefully. And over time, we do need to add assets to our portfolio. But we've made some choices based on costs. We exited the Australian Bight, a difficult decision. We've got a good relationship with the government, but that wasn't going to compete for capital going forward. So, we're really trying to be true to what we told you, where we're being returns-focused, and we're spending our money on what we think will be most economic. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow up on the chemicals side of the business? I mean, you continue to see potential expansions talked about in the chemicals industry, particularly, in the U.S. Gulf Coast. I know you guys have a cracker starting up here early next year. But can you talk about maybe what you view as future growth opportunities on that side of the business within CPChem? How aggressive you'd like to be and whether your Permian position \u2013 whether you think it allows for a certain amount of integration across the value chain there? John S. Watson: Yes. Well, as all of you know, we've got a good relationship with Phillips. And Chevron Phillips Chemical Company is a primary vehicle through which we invest in petrochemicals. And so, that relationship is good. We do have the plant that's \u2013 the derivatives are on-stream, and the ethylene plant's coming on early next year, so we do have that. And we have contemplated other expansions with them. I think it's fair to say that the economics of those have the potential to be good. And certainly the continued growth of NGLs and the growth in the Permian, I think, is going to contribute to an advantage feedstock position for a long time to come. But with the overall drop in prices that we seen and the impact of NAFTA, it's tighter than it was previously. But I expect \u2013 I mean our focus right now is getting the project we've got online, getting through that storm damage, and bringing the second phase of the project up. And then we'll consider the other opportunities. Ryan Todd : Great. Frank Mount : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Thank you. Frank Mount : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question, please. Anish Kapadia : Hi. Yeah, my first question was on exploration. You've called out for some frontier areas. You mentioned to buy, I think, in the Senegal and Mauritania area as well. I just wondered how do you think about the role of exploration and resource replenishment going forward? And how do you see exploration stacking up relative to mine resource in the current market? John S. Watson: Yeah. I think you'll see us putting more money into existing basins where we have a lot of expertise. So, for example, there will be a focus for us on the Gulf of Mexico, pending conditions, Nigeria's perspective, and some of our existing basins, I think. Look, remote areas, whether it's Arctic or Australian Bight or others, are just not likely to compete for capital. Believe it or not, we do have a little bit of exploration work that we'll do to continue our appraisal and assessment of some of our unconventional positions that are out there, but if you look at where resource ads are coming from and where reserve ads are coming from, I think you're going to continue to see strong contributions from our four unconventional businesses going forward. Anish Kapadia : Thank you. And then I had one follow-up. It feels like we're bottoming out in terms of costs in the international markets to some extent as well. So, from that regard, I was wondering if you could give some kind of update on the potential FIDs that you thought to take. I'm thinking about Rosebank, Tigris, Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico and some projects in Indonesia. Are any of these likely to be FID-ed in 2018, if you can account the costs where you want them, and do you have the capsule (01:04:38) availability to do it? John S. Watson: Yeah, it's a good question. I think we've gotten \u2013 we're working very hard. For example, Anchor and Tigris, in the Gulf of Mexico, those are in the concept development stage. So, we're not in feed yet with those projects. And a lot of the work that we're doing, for example, is to qualify equipment for the pressure regimes that we'll see. So, there's industry work to achieve some of the milestones in that area. At the same time, we have really joint teams that are working those two developments to see if we can really design once and have enough commonality in design for not only those two projects but for others in the industry, working with vendors to try to really do what we've talked about for a long time, which to better standardize the development schemes to bring the cost down. That work continues on those projects, and so \u2013 they're not in feed yet, so you wouldn't expect to see FID. Rosebank has been in feed and has been working very hard and diligently on both the concept and the cost. And they continue to make good progress, but I think it's fair to say that in a $50 world, we've got strong opportunities in the unconventional space and elsewhere. And so, we're continuing to work that project. It's a good opportunity for us, but there's more work yet to do. Frank Mount : Thanks, Anish. John S. Watson: Okay. I think that concludes my prepared remarks for today. I certainly appreciate the very kind words that all of you stated. I've enjoyed my coming up on eight years in the role. I appreciate the dialogue that I've had with both the sell side and the buy side. And I'll look forward to the afterlife. So, I wish you all the best. Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead. Mike Wirth : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Moving to Slide 3. This is a score card outlining performance against our 2017 commitments. We had a good year and accomplished what we set out to do. We met our objectives to get cash balanced. In fact, we were cash balanced without relying on proceeds from asset sales. We stayed below budget on capital spending and continued our downward trend in operating expenses. We\u2019d renew high margin production consistent with our guidance. We realized value from asset sales, with proceeds of more than $8 billion over two years, above the mid-point of the target range and we ended the year within the debt range we predicted. 2017 was a very successful year. We are proud of our progress and we intend to build on this momentum in 2018. Moving to Slide 4, as you can see from the bar chart, 2017 cash flow including asset sales and before dividends grew more than $17 billion from 2016. Some of this growth was a result of rising prices and some was from an increase in asset sale proceeds, but the majority was due to specific actions we took to improve cash generation from our operations. And the result, we were a cash flow positive without asset sales in 2017, a full year earlier than our commitment, with a little help from prices. And we enter 2018 with strong momentum. We know who owns our stock and what they expect. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend when we can sustainably support the increase with cash flow and earnings. That\u2019s why earlier this week we announced a dividend increase of $0.04 per share, putting us on track to make 2018 the 31st consecutive year of increased annual per share dividend payout. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results. Pat? Pat Yarrington : Alright, thank you Mike. Starting with Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.1 billion or $1.64 per diluted share, while 2017 full-year earnings were $9.2 billion. In the quarter, we had two special items. We recorded a non-cash provisional gain of $2 billion related to U.S. tax reform. We also recognized a non-cash remediation charge of $190 million associated with the former mining assets. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $96 million. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.4 billion or $0.72 per share. For the full-year, earnings on the same basis totaled $7 billion. Full-year cash flow from operations was $20.5 billion. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.2 billion, reflecting strong upstream production and higher realizations. Downstream results were noticeably lower than in the third quarter and I\u2019ll say more on that in just a moment. Excluding the $2 billion differed tax provision I just mentioned, the three items we have called out all year as headwinds to cash flow meaning changes in working capital, affiliate dividends less then earnings, and deferred taxes aggregated to around $3 billion for the year. For the quarter, these components represented a tailwind of approximately $350 million, in large part because of working capital effects. In the quarter, we had a noticeable increase in international income taxes payable. For the full-year, working capital was a minor benefit. Return on capital employed for 2017 was 5%. Our debt ratio at year-end was 21% and our net debt ratio was approximately 18%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. You\u2019re already aware that we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.12 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of February 16. We currently yield 3.6%. Now on Slide 6. Slide 6 compares full-year 2017 earnings with 2016. Full-year 2017 earnings were approximately $9.7 billion higher than 2016 results. Special items, primarily U.S. tax reform gain of $2 billion lower impairments and other charges of $1.9 billion, and increased gains from asset sales of $1 billion benefited our earnings by $4.9 billion. A swing in foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings between periods by $504 million. The passage of tax reform legislation in late December required that we revalue our net deferred tax liability to reflect the new lower 21% tax rate. Earnings impact from this adjustment are evident in all three of our were reporting segments, and again, I will refer you to the appendix for the detailed segmented information. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by about 5.1 billion between periods. Higher realizations, increased volumes, and lower costs were partially offset by higher DD&A, which was mostly associated with increased production. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by just under 400 million. Higher margins were partially offset by lower volumes and lower earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the impacts of Hurricane Harvey. Full-year 2017 other segment results were in line with our guidance. Our 2018 guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in net charges. This includes approximately $600 million of interest expense that was previously capitalized and $300 million worth of incremental tax effects as net charges are deducted at the lower rate post U.S. tax reform. As a reminder, our quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable. Turning to Slide 7. We are aware of the challenges of modelling and integrated company like Chevron, and in particular modelling downstream results in the quarter were oil prices grows as fast as they did. I therefore like to provide some additional commentary. Our downstream margins were squeezed by rising feedstock costs. We estimate this adverse margin effect between third quarter and fourth quarter to be about 500 million across our operations, but specifically on the West Coast where we have two or our three main U.S. refineries. Industry refinery utilization in PADD 5 was very strong during the second half of the quarter, leading to abundant supplies and putting even greater pressure on margins. We also experienced adverse impacts from two hurricanes. We estimate a further $119 million penalty from these, relative to the third quarter. I\u2019m referencing both Hurricane Nate at the Pascagoula, where a precautionary shutdown was taken; and Hurricane Harvey, which flooded CPChem\u2019s Cedar Bayou plant. While the hurricanes were known to have hit our facilities, sizing the financial impact would have been difficult. I\u2019d note that these fourth quarter impacts are not structural, they are transitory and we believe the fundamentals around demand, supply, production, prices and margins for refined products and chemicals are positive for 2018. The other segment for the quarter was a sizeable negative, but the full-year charges were aligned with the guidance I gave third quarter call. And lastly, but very importantly, we had very solid results in upstream in the quarter. Our strong operating performance was complemented by rising prices and both favorable elements are expected to continue in 2018. As you know, our earnings and cash flows are highly leveraged to crude prices and this leverage is expected to grow as our production grows in 2018. Turning now to Slide 8. Slide 8 illustrates 2017 production is of 2.73 million barrels a day, an increase of 134,000 barrels a day or 5%, up from 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 240,000 barrels a day, as we started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Angola LNG. Lower plant turnaround effects, primarily at Tengiz, favorably impacted production between periods by 34,000 barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased 46,000 barrels a day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Base declines, net of production from new wells such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 45,000 barrels a day. PSC effects reduced production by 68,000 barrels a day, as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. The impact of asset sales, mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and mid-continent reduced production by 66,000 barrels a day. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mike. Mike Wirth : Alright, thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement is a real success story. As this chart shows, over the last five years we\u2019ve added about 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. Our reserve replacement ratio was 155% in 2017, and 107% over the last five years. We\u2019re especially pleased with this outcome because it was achieved on top of growing production last year. Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.7 demonstrating the strength and sustainability of our business. In 2017, the Permian was the largest contributor to reserve additions, where we continue to lower our cost structure, focus our investment, and develop our resources in a capital efficient manner. As we continue to ramp up our rig fleet, we\u2019re confident this pattern should continue. We also saw significant adds elsewhere across the portfolio, including from the Gorgon Project where well performance has been encouraging. Moving to Slide 10. This chart shows the continued progress we\u2019ve made on spend reduction. As you can see, capital on operating expenses were down again this year. 2017 C&E spending was $18.8 billion, down $3.6 million from the prior year, and more than $21 billion from three years earlier. 2017 full year operating costs were more than $1 billion lower than 2016, despite higher upstream production. When compared to 2014, we\u2019re down by nearly $6 billion. I expect this to maintain capital and cost discipline. We\u2019re improving work processes, negotiating better rates from contractors and vendors, and becoming more efficient in all that we do. And technology offers opportunities for even more. We are in a cyclical commodity business. Capital discipline always matters. Costs, always matter. Now to Slide 11, and asset sales. This chart shows asset sale proceeds of $8 billion over the last two years, with 5.2 billion coming in 2017. The two-year total is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $5 billion to $10 billion. Moving forward, we will continue to optimize our portfolio where appropriate, using proceeds to support strong asset and shareholder returns. The criteria for divestments is straightforward. We will plan to sell assets that don't have a strategic fit or won\u2019t compete for capital and work more to someone else, and when we can receive good value. We don't discuss specific assets until we\u2019re into a transaction. We have one of these underway. The sale of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business, which is expected to close in 2018. Moving to Slide 12, our Australian LNG assets are becoming strong cash generators with cash margins of more than $30 per barrel at $50 Brent price. Currently, four trains are online and running well. Well performance for both projects looks good. During the fourth quarter, we completed pit stops on Gorgon Train 1 and Train 3 to improve reliability and increase production. Gorgon's average January production was 459,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 86,000 barrels from the fourth quarter average on a 100% basis. During 2017, Gorgon shipped 170 cargoes. At Wheatstone, during the fourth quarter, we started Train 1, reached design capacity, and successfully address the commissioning strainers, which is a standard part of commissioning this type of LNG plant design. Wheatstone Train 1 average January production was 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a 100% basis. First LNG for Wheatstone Train 2 is slated for second-quarter 2018. We start-up for Wheatstone domestic gas the following quarter. Now, let\u2019s go to the Permian on Slide 13. Production in the Permian continues to exceed expectations as we drive further efficiency gains and improved well performance. In the fourth quarter, we produced approximately 205,000 barrels per day, up approximately 60,000 barrels per day from the same period in 2016. Full-year 2017 production averaged 181,000 barrels per day, up 35% over the prior year. We\u2019re currently operating 16 rigs in the basin and plan to end this year with 20 company operated rigs. And in support of our development program, we\u2019re currently employing six pressure pumping crews. I\u2019ll update you on progress to optimize our land position in the Permian on Slide 14. In 2017, we enhanced the value of our position by transacting more than 60,000 acres through various swaps, joint ventures farmouts and sales. These transactions improve capital efficiency and create value by consolidating land positions, allowing longer laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies. Last year's transactions enabled nearly 600 additional long laterals to be added to our well inventory. We intend to continue this activity to consolidate our land positions and optimize the value of our future developments. We\u2019ll provide further information on the Permian at our Analyst Day in early March. Now, let\u2019s move to the overall production outlook on Slide 15. For this year, production at $16 Brent is expected to be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Growth is expected to be driven by LNG in Australia, Shale and tight particularly in the U.S. and Canada, and other capital projects. Partially offsetting that will be full year impacts of 2017 asset sales and base decline. The forecasted production range reflects the uncertainties associated with start-up timing, rates of production project ramp up, base decline and external events. In summary, we anticipate another year of strong production growth. Moving to Slide 16, we\u2019ve had a number of recent developments that I\u2019d like to acknowledge. Earlier this week, we announced a major discovery in the U.S. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Ballymore. This discovery has 670 feet of net oil pay with excellent reservoir year and fluid characteristics. And importantly, it\u2019s close to our existing Blind Faith platform. We\u2019re currently drilling a sidetrack well to further evaluate the extent of the resource. Also, this week, we confirmed a major discovery at the Whale prospect in the US Gulf of Mexico where we\u2019re 40% partner. This find is approximately 10 miles from the Perdido platform. These discoveries are exciting for both their resource potential and their proximity to existing infrastructure, which offers the possibility for faster and more capital efficient development. Also, this week, we along with our partners were successful bidders on a large Deepwater block in Mexico, adding to our position there. An installation is underway at Bigfoot. We\u2019re installed seven of the 16 mooring tendons. On Tuesday, the tension-leg platform sale from the dry dock facility in Ingleside, Texas. First production is forecast for late this year. In downstream, CPChem reached mechanical completion of the Gulf Coast cracker in December and has begun the process of commissioning. We expect to start up later this quarter and reach full production in the second quarter of 2018. You'll recall that the derivative units achieved first production in September of last year. Finally, on tax reform, we believe the new legislation is good for business, and for consumers. It is a positive for Chevron making attractive investment opportunities in the Permian, the Gulf of Mexico, and in our US downstream and chemicals business look even better. Our US capital and exploratory spend is expected to be up approximately $8 billion this year, and some $25 billion over the next three years. Moving to Slide 17, I would like to share a few closing thoughts. Over the last decade plus, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to get to know many of you. I\u2019ve been listening and your input has been helpful as I move into my new role. I\u2019m guided by my background, experience and a few core beliefs. I grew up playing sports and I like to win. I intend to lead Chevron to win in any environment. To win, you need to have clear convictions. Here are some of mine. We must be disciplined in returns driven in capital allocation. Our cost structure needs to improve further. Costs, always matter. We can get more out of the assets that we have as we can operate them better and more reliably. We can optimize across the entire value chain to capture more value. And we need to continue to high-grade our portfolio and our resource base. To build the assets to win today and tomorrow, not yesterday. For those of you I know, I look forward to seeing you more in the coming months and years. For those of you I don't, I look forward to meeting you. I\u2019m committed to continuing to grow cash flow, improve, returns, and deliver value to our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Jonathan, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please? Phil Gresh : Hi, good morning and congratulations Mike. Mike Wirth : Thank you. Phil Gresh : I\u2019ll start with, I have one for Pat and one for Mike. So, Pat, you talked about these moving pieces around CFO items, these transitory factors that have been going on throughout 2017, and I was just curious how you think about 2018 with those factors, the deferred tax, working capital, equity affiliates, you know does that continue to be a headwind, does it dissipate in anyway? Pat Yarrington : So, I think the short answer would be, to a large extent there will be some continuing factors. The largest single component there would be the difference that we would expect between affiliate earnings and affiliate dividends. That will continue to be a component there. The harder one to predict, clearly will be what\u2019s happening on that deferred tax side of things that will be very price dependent, and then of course working capital is always very hard as well. But if I assume that there is no change in working capital, just assume prices at the beginning of the year or the same is at the end of the year, and our activity levels are relatively flattish. So, no impact from working capital and I put the other two components together. So, the affiliate distributions versus earnings component, as well as an estimate around deferred taxes, I would say somewhere on the order of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion worth of headwinds would be the best estimate, but I have to say, I reserve the right at any time to come back and tell you as different number of prices are significantly different than where they are, today. Phil Gresh : I understand, but I appreciate that. Mike, just on your final remarks that you made, appreciate those and I guess my follow-up to that would be, we saw a nice hike in the dividend, $0.04 and as we think about the cash flow profile for the company heading into 2018 at current price levels, it seems like you have a lot of excess cash, so any initial thoughts you could share with us about how you think about deploying that cash, is there room for buybacks, is prices holding where they are? Mike Wirth : Well Phil, the first thing I would say is, our priorities have been consistent for quite some time, and I have no expectations that those will change. So, dividends come first and you\u2019ve seen that and I\u2019m pleased that the board saw, has a confident view of our future and was willing to authorize the increase you just saw. Reinvestment in the business, we\u2019ve talked about that, and we\u2019ve got our budget outlined and a good program underway this year. Third is, balance sheet and we\u2019ve gone from having relatively for us higher levels of debt down to a range lower within the range that we\u2019d indicated further and then of course, historically one we\u2019ve had cash surplus to those needs, we have bought back shares. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to be consistent in those priorities. It\u2019s always a balance across all of those and we really been in a period where we\u2019ve seen three years of declining or unexciting commodity prices, and three months of encouraging ones. I think it\u2019s a little premature to get ahead of sales on this, but the dividend increase was certainly a signal that we feel good about where our business is positioned to the fact that we\u2019re cash balance, and if we continue to be in a constructive environment, obviously we\u2019ll have cash to balance across all of those priorities. So, more to follow. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thanks Mike. Frank Mount : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. I think it\u2019s still morning, good morning everybody and Mike congrats on officially taking the reins and getting on the call this morning. I have two questions. I guess one is, kind of a follow-up to Phil\u2019s and it really relates to the strong performance in the Permian. You\u2019ve kind of positioned the Permian, in the past there is something of an offset to base decline, but obviously it\u2019s a pretty strong growth in asset in its own right. Is that how we should think about the Permian as basically a means of resetting your sustaining capital or should we think about something that can actually become a bit more of a topline growth engine for the company? Mike Wirth : Well, I think if you look at it on its own, it clearly is a growth engine. The nature of the activity is more aligned with what you would traditionally think of our base business, right. It is ongoing drilling of wells that individually carry with on a low risk profile that are relatively quick to execute and it\u2019s the kind of thing that over time you can Flex that up or you can flex it down. So, one of the reasons I think it\u2019s been useful for people to think about putting base and Shale and tight together is their operational characteristics, their flexibility, the cycle time, the risk profile. I have more in common than our base business does with the really large major capital projects that we\u2019ve had. So, I do think you can think of them together. We\u2019ve done a really nice job of mitigating our base decline on its own, and then when you add the Shale and tight with it, the growth there is actually and you can see it on Slide 8, greater than the base decline is. And so, we\u2019ve got low risk, a very predictable flexible and controllable growth offsetting that base decline, and giving us a strong foundation as we move forward that just has a very, very different risk profile than a long cycle major capital project where there is a big bang at the end, but there is a greater latency period. So, we will certainly talk more about this in March, but I think it\u2019s one of the fundamental shifts in the outlook for our company. I think it\u2019s a fundamental shift in risk profile, and the variability around our cash flows, and frankly it really underpins a really good story as we move forward. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the full-answer. My follow-up is really harking back to the breakfast you hosted in December, and it really relates to, I think a comment you made about the culture of cost reduction from other parts of the business hadn't really, and not to put words in your mouth, but hadn't translated into E&P. So, during a period of growth, obviously so I\u2019m just curious, are you happy with the cost structure in the E&P business, and the maturity profile of the underlying portfolio, and I guess it is another way of saying, should we expect another rest in the asset sales program as we go forward? And I will leave it there. Thanks. Mike Wirth : All right. Well there is a couple of things. I think cost culture and the portfolio. The entire industry as commodity prices went into the surge and then stayed strong for a long period of time had incentives to try to capitalize on that, and there is no doubt that the cost structure within the industry grew as a result of that. Most of my working life has been spent in our part of business where those periods of times are in frequent and short in duration, and so I come from a mindset that you always have to be looking at cost and in particular, you need to be very cost conscious at a time when external conditions are incenting you to be less so. And so, I think that being focused on efficiency throughout the cycle is one of the keys to success. I tried to make that point in my closing remarks there. Our upstream business has done a fantastic job in getting our cost down, and I\u2019m really pleased with what I\u2019ve seen, and what\u2019s been accomplished, and so there has been great progress I mentioned $6 billion in spend reduction over the last few years. I think going forward, the challenge is, how do we sustain that momentum, and there is an opportunity to continuously focus on this to challenge everything that we do for more efficiency to look for technology, which I think can unlock a lot of cost reduction. And then to leverage some of the things we\u2019re learning in our Permian activity, and our shale and tight activity and ask, how does the supplier cross other parts of the business. So, it\u2019s a long answer to saying, yes, I expect us to continue to work on costs, irrespective of the external environment. When I moved to portfolio, I made a comment about focusing on those assets that are the ones that allow us to compete and win today and tomorrow, and I do expect as to invest in those things that we think are the assets that will be a highly competitive as we move into the future, and to test ourselves on the things that may have been really important in our past and may still be or may not be as we go forward. So, the last couple of years are as said, transaction activity has been in part at least driven by the intent to get cash balance. As we move forward, it\u2019s driven more by the intent to ensure we\u2019ve got a portfolio that\u2019s highly competitive that deliver strong returns and is set up to compete in the future. Frank Mount : Thanks Doug. Doug Leggate : I guess we'll wait on the Analyst Day [ph]. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Hi, thanks and congrats Mike. I actually wanted to follow-up where you left of there on the asset sales program, any early thoughts on 2018? You\u2019ve been through a two-year pretty substantial divestiture program, a fewer things on the docket it seems like in 2018, so how should we think about what the new normal is for our divestitures? Mike Wirth : Yes, Neil, I think you should expect us to continue to monetize assets where we can get fair value and they\u2019re worth more to someone else than they are to us. And we have gone through a lot. You\u2019ve seen those close. The Gulf of Mexico Shelf exit was one where those assets have some running life ahead of them. Within our portfolio, they\u2019ll struggle to compete for capital in somebody else's portfolio, they\u2019ll draw capital in investments and continue to create value for that company. And so, we probably have other assets that would, could fit that profile. So, I think when we get to our Analyst Day in March, we\u2019ll probably speak to this a little bit more, but my view is, you can't fall in love with your portfolio, you have to constantly challenge whether or not it will compete in the future, and you have to be willing to make moves to invest in the things that you believe are highly competitive, and be willing to face the realities and things that you are less likely to fund and that you may be able to redeploy that cash into assets that strengthen your competitive position. So, more of an optimization philosophy. It is what we have done in other parts of the business and it served us very well, and we will talk to you more about that as we have things that are ready to be discussed, publicly. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that Mike and then, in the slides the 4 to 7% production growth in 2018, I think is generally well received, is still relatively wide range relative to the base of production that you have, can you talk about some of those uncertainties that could drive you to the upper end or the lower end of the range? Mike Wirth : Yes. So, I realize there is a bit of a range there. What we\u2019ve done is try to reflect the realities that project start-ups are things that we have got plans, and then you work hard to deliver those, but there can be some variability in start-ups and then you\u2019ve got to ramp ups as well. And so, and I guess the final thing that I would say is, you do have unexpected events that can get you. We\u2019ve experienced sabotage, you know the partition zone is still down and that was not something that was necessarily anticipated. We work in parts of the world that have challenging environments and things happen. So, there is a range there, clearly, we\u2019re working to deliver strong growth and we\u2019d expect to be within that range. Over the years, we have ended up on Mr. Sankey's Porcupine Chart, I think, when we've gotten out of our skis a little bit. So, I try to be sure that we can give you a range that we\u2019re confident, and in this year, we gave you a range that was little wider may be than you would have liked, but we landed squarely in the middle of that. And so, we're just trying to reflect the realities that these things are, you know they\u2019re not precisely forecastable, but we\u2019re trying to show you that we\u2019ve got a strong commitment to deliver good production growth again this year. Frank Mount : Thanks, Neil. Neil Mehta : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Well thanks for that Mike. And I guess I know what I'm going to be publishing on Sunday as a chart, but firstly congratulations and I would like to second previous comments that we do greatly appreciate that you guys take the time to come on the quarterly call every quarter. So, thanks for that. Mike Wirth : You're welcome. Paul Sankey : Mike, having said all that, there is a theme of the day which is cash flows that you guys are generating and you did mention cash flow breakeven balance, and when we look at oil at 60 for the quarter-ish, I guess we're totally perplexed by why cash flows, and you\u2019ve given an ex-working capital number, why cash flows are so low given the move in oil? Could you talk about where that\u2019s going to go next year, and whether, if oil prices were to persist, what we would expect to see for cash flows versus CapEx from the company? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yes, so Pat has given you given you some of the pieces, and if she wants to try to go a little deeper, I\u2019ll invite her too in a second. I have got to tell you Paul, I\u2019m very pleased and optimistic with the outlook for cash flow. You know, our cash flow from operations improved every quarter during 2017. I sighted a few of the things that are already evident this year, which is significantly stronger production in January at Gorgon, significantly stronger production already this year at Wheatstone. Significantly stronger production in the Permian, in a price environment that you\u2019ve just described. The downstream issues that we faced in the fourth quarter are not structural. They are not repeating, hurricanes happen, but they tend not to hit the same places every year, and margins in the business can ebb and flow. We don't have structural issues in the downstream at all. Our downstream has been a strong contributor of our earnings returns and cash flow for many, many years. So, I used the word momentum a couple of times in my remarks, and we in fact do have momentum in cash flow. So, we have got growing production. The production we're bringing in line is cash flow accretive. You know, I mentioned that our LNG out of Australia is $30 cash margin at a $50 Brent price. Obviously, we\u2019re above that today. So, all the fundamental drivers of cash flow are moving in the right direction. There is a few are headwinds, which Pat touched on, but the fundamentals here are very strong and those are what I am focused on. So, I feel good about 2018. Paul Sankey : Yes, Mike, just quickly to follow up, could you just reiterate the 2018 balance aspirations, I think they were excess of sales for cash flow versus CapEx? Mike Wirth : Yes, we said, we would be cash balance in 2018 without asset sales at $50 Brent. Clearly, if we have a year that is above $50 Brent, we will be better than cash balance without asset sales. And you also mentioned capital in there Paul, so let me just touch on that. You know, we\u2019ve got a capital budget and that capital budget is driven by a program that will deliver the results I just spoke to. We don\u2019t budget based on the oil price of the day. We have got a longer-term view on commodity prices and we set our plans based on those views not the then current oil price. So, the fact that we\u2019re enjoying a little bit better commodity price environment as we sit here today is not something that is going to change our capital plans or our capital budget. Frank Mount : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Hi, everyone and Mike let me add my congratulations as well. Mike Wirth : Thanks Jason. Jason Gammel : I just want to go to the chart on, excuse me the graph on chart 13 that depicts the Permian production, and the actual production is clearly way ahead of the type curves that you got laid out, and that\u2019s for 16 rigs, and conscious you're going to be going to 20. So, other than Bruce Niemeyer getting a well-deserved promotion, I was hoping that you might be able to come up with some of the factors that have led to this outperformance, and realize that you are not going to necessarily change the curves and tell at least March? Mike Wirth : Well, what I would say is, it has just been a focus on the fundamentals. We\u2019ve used technology to do better assessment of seismic attributes and better understand the resource. Our petrophysical modeling continues to improve. We are using new technologies to control drill bits and improve the precision of our lateral placement. There is a new basis of design where we change well spacing, optimize our sand concentration per stage, we have increased the number of stages. We have got tighter perforation. There is a continual optimization process in place and I would just tell you same thing that Bruce and others have reiterated is, we not only learn from what we are doing, but we are brining the learnings from joint venture partners and others that we see and rapidly applying those to improve performance. So, our costs are going down. Our productivity is going up. Our recoveries continue to grow and I don't think we\u2019ve seen the end of the improvement curve here. We\u2019re finding more efficiencies, our development costs this year are lower than our target was. Our target for, or last year they were, our target for 2018 is lower than it was in 2017, and so we expect to see continual improvement. For those of you that visited the Permian last year, I think you heard our people describe what they call the Frankenwell, the perfect well where we continue to redefine what that looks like, and redefine what goods looks like. So, this is a story that when you match it up with our large land position, which we\u2019re optimizing. I talked about that and building a deeper inventory of long lateral and highly efficient acreage for us to get after the ability through the midstream and downstream to add value and create more margin. And on top of that you put a royalty position. This is an asset that I expect to continue to get better. We will talk about that more when we see in March and we will update some of the guidance that we\u2019ve given you on what to expect. Jason Gammel : We'll look forward to that and as my second question Mike, just looking at the capital allocation for 2018 to the base upstream business relative to 2017, and this excludes the shale and tight allocations. Base business allocation is down by about 25% year-over-year. It doesn't look like your assumptions on the base decline curve have really changed, however. So, could you talk about some of the factors that you\u2019re seeing in the base business that is leading to the lower capital allocation with a similar expected result? Mike Wirth : Yes, you\u2019re right. We do have lower capital going into the base business this year. Some of that is simply driven by what the opportunity set looks like there, and what the opportunity set looks like in the Permian. We\u2019ve, like I said, we\u2019ve done a really nice job across a lot of our producing assets in holding base decline at pretty flattish levels. And so, the efficiencies that I have talked about in the Permian are the kinds of things that we\u2019re seeing across the entire base business. We\u2019ve taken cost out of the supply chain. We\u2019ve improved the efficiency and productivity of operations and at times some of the things in the base can be deepwater infield drilling, which tends to be a little bit bigger dollar. And so, as those programs ebb and flow that can cycle that base business a little bit as well, but we\u2019re in a range here as you look it, it says we can keep our base pretty flat at relatively manageable capital spend. You put the Permian on top of that and you look at just a combination of those two elements and you say okay, we have a base load of capital that can hold our production flat or even slightly growing base load of capital that can keep production flatter. So, I think it is a relatively modest capital relative to the size of our company, and so we\u2019ll talk more about the sustainability and what you can expect on that when we see in March. Frank Mount : Thank you, Jason. Jason Gammel : Great, looking forward it. Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Cheng : Hi guys, good morning. Mike Wirth : Hi, Paul. Pat Yarrington : Hi, Paul. Paul Cheng : Hi. Mike, may I add my congratulations to you. And also, I just want to echo what Sankey has said, really appreciate. You guys come on to the call from time to time. I hope that at least one of your other major competitors will do the same. Two questions. First, Mike, in the coming months, I will assume you are going to go and visit all your internal people around the group. During those visits, what is the number one and number two message that you want to send to them in terms of where you think you may need to do more effort in twisting [ph], whether it's in certain practice or culture? And where you want to sharpen the focus. Mike Wirth : Well, thanks Paul for the kind words and the question. I do intend to get out and about and see people and deliver some messages. I mean the first one is, it has been a rough few years for people in, particularly in our upstream business and we have weathered that storm and so the message is, simply thank you for what you have done to put us in a position now, where we\u2019re cash positive going forward. With that asset sales we\u2019ve taken a lot of cost out of the business and they\u2019ve worked hard to do that. I\u2019ve touched on a couple of things already. One is, we have to be prepared to win in any environment. And I think that\u2019s particularly important as you start to see a little recovery in oil price that we not think that the hard work is over. We\u2019ve got to focus on returns. We still have returns that need to improve. And we can't count on market to do that. So, we\u2019ve got to keep focusing on self-help and that means we find efficiencies and everything we do. We challenge our portfolio, and some of the things I\u2019ve talked about. So, there is a - we\u2019ve got to win in any environment. We\u2019ve got to improve returns. I think, some of the areas that are focused on the things that really matter, and big companies can some time try to do everything, and there is few things we can focus on that will really drive performance. We need to execute, and that means capital projects. We need to execute on cost management. We need to execute on our safety and reliability initiatives. And then, the third one is, how do we bring more technology into our business? You look around and technology is changing the world. We\u2019ve got lots and lots of digital technology applications that are springing up all over our business. I\u2019d like to see that happen faster. I think there is more that we can do with technology. I think it can drive further efficiencies in our cost structure. I think it can drive further productivity in our assets. I think it can help us mitigate operating risks. And, so I talked to them about how do we continue to find ways to leverage technology to further improve performance. So those will be some of the key messages that they\u2019ll be hearing from me. Paul Cheng : Okay. The second question is that, on the U.S. onshore market clearly on the [indiscernible] basis, we are seeing cost inflation. Just want to see whether you believe your productivity gain will be more than - or that could be fully offset and so your unit costs will be essentially flat? And in the outside U.S., I think the service cost, doesn't seem like on the spot rate is dropping. But should we assume that your overall unit cost may still be dropping because you have other contracts maybe rolling over? Mike Wirth : Yes. Paul, you are touching on important points. That\u2019s one of the questions a lot of people are asking, as are we going to see cost inflation. I will tell you right now as we go around the world and we engage in sourcing exercises, we are not seeing evidence of strong cost inflation really anywhere. Now, you mentioned the Permian. I\u2019ll come back and talk the Permian in a minute, but we really are continuing to find opportunities to hold or even improve costs as we look around the world. In the Permian, there is more activity picking up, and so you can expect that there is talk of that, you know two-thirds of our spend in the Permian is protected with contracts right now. Those contracts have been negotiated before we went into this year. We\u2019ve got kind of a philosophy of managed competition there to lock in and with our size and leverage we\u2019re in an attractive base load for a number of these suppliers. So, we\u2019ve locked in a good pricing fixed index, fixed pricing in much of the portfolio. Some indexed pricing. So, if there are certain indices that moved, we will accommodate that and then there are incentive contracts where you have some of our service providers can meet performance benchmarks that drive our costs lower there is some sharing of that as well. So, we\u2019re focused on ways to continue to improve our cost position there and the efficiencies in activity and productivity that we\u2019ve seen in recent times have amplified reductions in input costs. If you start to see input costs level out or even turn a little bit, I still expect further improvements in productivity and efficiency will offset that. So, we could see some very modest, but I\u2019m talking single-digit, overall increase within the Permian, but a step back to our whole portfolio we\u2019ve got growing production, and we are not going to allow cost to grow at the rate that production is growing, and so from my unit cost standpoint, you can absolutely expect that we're still focused on driving unit costs even lower. Frank Mount : Thanks Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please. Alastair Syme : Thank you and hello, everyone. Mike, one of your peers has recently suggested that SEC reserves are becoming a less meaningful metric for the industry. And obviously, this is a metric that Chevron has scored very highly on in recent years. So, can I get you to offer your perspective on how you look - as you look closer into the E&P business, how you view reserve life as a management KPI? And whether you think there is an optimal reserve life for the business to be running? Mike Wirth : Yes. So, we respect the SEC's roles and their reserve process. We are very diligent in setting up our own internal approach to reserves to be sure that we have the right checks and balances, and so we - I\u2019m not going to suggest the SEC regressive rules or anything with something that we understand, comply with and they are, I think a consistent benchmark for investors to use to evaluate companies. And so, like many things, you can argue are they perfect or not, but it is a consistent benchmark and we all use it. So, I think it\u2019s useful. I believe stability and reserve life is good. If you see reserve life growing it\u2019s either a sign that your production is declining, or that you are investing prematurely or too much. If you see the reserve where reserve life is declining, it starts to raise questions about sustainability about the need to go out, and spend money to acquire resource and so to me stability is the key. We\u2019ve had a good stable R-over-P ratio here for the last many years and continue to add our reserves, primarily through organic activity. I talked about the reserve ads this year being driven by the Permian and Gorgon. Those are big contributors, and those are certainly contributors that we can see out into the future. We would expect to play a part in extending reserves life as we go forward. So, I think each company has got their own particular set of circumstances, and I\u2019ll only comment on ours. I think we\u2019re in a good strong and sustainable reserves position. Alastair Syme : Brilliant. Thank you. That's very, very helpful. Frank Mount : Thanks Al. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please. Blake Fernandez : First, good morning, and my congratulations as well. Back, I guess, right on that reserves topic. Maybe Pat, this is a question for you, but given the nice increase that you saw this year, is it fair to think that DD&A rates have potential to move lower as a result of that? Pat Yarrington : Yes. I do believe that. I don\u2019t have an order of magnitude for you at the moment because we are just finalizing that. You\u2019ll note that the numbers we\u2019ve put out are preliminary and we\u2019re tying that now between now and when we publish the 10-K later in February. But yes, I do directionally that will happen. We will have lower DD&A rates. Blake Fernandez : Perfect. The second question is on the, I guess recent discoveries you\u2019ve had, both look pretty attractive and then look like they have fast track potential. Given this focus on short cycle, the past 12 to 18 months or so, obviously, you haven't sanctioned many projects, but these look promising. I guess I'm just trying to understand the timing of when you could look at sanctioning that and how that would fall into the capital program. And I guess what I'm thinking there specifically is phasing with Tengiz. As Tengiz rolls off, could these kind of make their way in and hopefully not create a step-change in total spending? Mike Wirth : Yes. We\u2019re really still appraising these discoveries, and they\u2019re encouraging and we\u2019re very pleased with the first look and the proximity to infrastructure, but I think it\u2019s really premature to jump into exactly when and how those would be developed, other than the proximity the infrastructure does open up more capital efficient developments alternatives and you would see if you were distant from, but more work to be done to be sure that these have been fully characterized. I think to get above that a little bit, I would just say that we really believed in a more ratable C&E program is important. I think it helps us financially. I think it helps us from our standpoint of execution. And so, I think that the swings you\u2019ve seen in our C&E spend are things that we will try to significantly dampen out and stay in a more ratable band. The last thing I would say is, no matter how good this resource looks, and how interesting it is, we\u2019ve got a great option in our shale and tight portfolio and other resource classes and Gulf of Mexico deepwater is a great example of that. Need to get the cost down in order to compete for funding. Our people know that that\u2019s what they need to do to make these competitive within our portfolio for funding, and that\u2019s why I think the brownfield aspect of these is interesting, but they have to compete and they have to deliver attractive returns and economics relative to our other alternatives. Frank Mount : Thanks Blake. Blake Fernandez : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Maybe another one on capital allocation. Post the tax reform, does the tax reform in the U.S. impact the way that you think about investment at all over the next five years, either from - in terms of an increase in cash flow or from an improved rate of return from associated or particular projects? Or should we think that you will generally continue to err on the side of capital constraint? I guess how - does it figure at all in terms of how you look at allocating capital over the next five years? Mike Wirth : Yes, we\u2019re still grinding through the real details of our specific position and these are - companies like ours have complex tax positions and so to get too specific about that, it\u2019s probably premature. I would say that it makes U.S. assets and investments more attractive because they are going to be attracting a lower tax rate. And so, I think over time, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s good for the U.S. economy. I think it\u2019s good for U.S. companies. I think it\u2019s good for investment in this country, and we have significant assets here already and opportunities to invest in the future. So, we will grind through all of that and make sure that we get a clear understanding and guidance. The other thing if you think about it through the lens is, you know as we have assets around the world, some in fiscal regimes that have not changed for quite some time whether it\u2019s in response to lower prices or the changes in the US tax laws, those investments become tougher to make, frankly. And so, I think, the other thing is governments around the world will over time have to evaluate the competitiveness of their fiscal terms relative to the options that a company like ours would have. We allocate our capital to drive better returns across the global portfolio, and so as these things move around it\u2019s a competitive world and we need to acknowledge that as do others. Frank Mount : Thanks Ryan. Ryan Todd : And then maybe a follow-up on the Permian. You've been relatively active and you have a slide in there on acreage sales that you've done over the past few years and expectations for 2018. If you think about the program, I mean, would you characterize it as more of an effort to core up your position? Or is it an effort to pull forward to some extent kind of the long-term tail of the valuation, a mix of both? And I guess kind of given your expectation of going to 20 rigs at year-end, you clearly have a very, very, very long resource life there. How should we think about your philosophy in terms of maximizing the value of the asset? Could you monetize more in terms of monetizing some of the tail or accelerating rig count? I mean, how do you look at maximization of the value of that resource? Mike Wirth : It\u2019s a good question. The real goal is to maximize the value of the resource position and the largest driver by a significant amount is coring up acreage, so that we can get longer laterals in the efficiencies that we continue to see out of our operations. I mentioned, we understand the resource much better today than we did 12-months ago, and our 24-months ago, and I think we will understand the resource better 12-months from now, as we continue to use more and more sophisticated tools and gain more experience and insights into what makes it work. So, as you have that kind of knowledge and you\u2019ve got a large land position we would intend to drive our portfolio to what we believe are the sweetest of the sweet spots and the positions that will create the most value over time. If that means some of it is, what you would describe as further back in the queue, and the right thing to do is simply to exit it for cash and redeploying into coring up today, that is certainly a part of it. But it\u2019s a value driven strategy and it\u2019s to say, okay we\u2019ve, how do we get the most value out of the 2 million acres that we have there. So, it is not driven by any intent to sell the tail alone, but it is really to create value across the whole position. Frank Mount : Thank you, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our final question\u2026 Pat Yarrington : One more question, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : Thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. Good morning, everybody. Mike, if I could follow up a little bit on Ryan's question, you kind of talked about the Permian position there, is it easier, the same, or more difficult to do the swaps and exchanges? In other words, as everyone gets more comfortable with what they own, or are we seeing it where people are less certain what they own and it is slowing down some of the exchanges? I know you had kind of a 200,000 acre, 80,000 done so far. I'm just curious how that's progressing. Mike Wirth : Yes, what I would say Roger is, it is one of those unique places where you can drive win wins and because the way the acreage was defined over a 100 years ago and the way it has been held over time, and the technology today with these longer laterals and the value creation through that kind of a development program, it\u2019s in everybody's best interest to find ways to improve their position, and oftentimes in commercial negotiations we\u2019ve got a win lose and that can create a tougher dynamic than one where both parties can realize value. And you sit down at the table and both really have incentives to find a way to do a deal. So, I would say, we may in fact have been a little more difficult to deal with, heretofore simply because of our, let\u2019s go slow to really understand what we\u2019ve got approach to this. And whether you're talking development or you are talking land optimization, there is a lot of activity going on in the basin where we weren't necessarily engaged in as much of it. Now that we are in a position, we feel like we really understand what we want, and where we want to go, and we\u2019re willing to deal. We\u2019ve got numerous conversations underway with counterparties, and I think there is strong reason to believe that we will conclude further value creating transactions this year and into the future. Roger Read : Okay, great. Thank you, and I\u2019ll see you next month. Mike Wirth : Okay. I know we\u2019re just a touch over time here. So, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. I truly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and everyone's participation in the call. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York in a few weeks. Jonathan, back over to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Pat Yarrington : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Mark Nelson, Vice President of Midstream, Strategy & Policy. Also joining us on the call are Frank Mount and Wayne Borduin who are currently transitioning in a role of General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $3.6 billion or $1.90 per diluted share. Earnings excluding foreign exchange and special items were also $3.6 billion. A reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange and other non GAAP measure can be found in an appendix to this presentation. This is our strongest earnings result since the third quarter of 2014 when Brent prices were above $100. For the current quarter, Brent price averaged $67 per barrel. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5 billion. Excluding working capital effect, cash flow from operations was $7.1 billion. At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $40 billion, which resulted in a headline debt ratio of 20.9% and a net debt ratio of 18.1%. During the first quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends. We currently yield 3.6%. Turning to Slide 4. We are on track to deliver on our 2018 cash generation guidance from our recent analyst meeting. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, grew to $7.1 billion. Positive impacts of strong realizations and high-margin volume growth were partially offset by equity affiliate dividends that were about $1 billion lower than equity affiliate earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3 billion, approximately $300 million or 10% below first quarter 2017, as we continue to complete our major capital projects under construction and drive improved capital efficiency across our portfolio. The results free cash flow, excluding working capital effects, was $4.2 billion approximately $2.5 billion higher than the average quarter in 2017. Assets held proceeds within the quarter were minimal. However, with the closing in April of the Elk Hills transaction and the anticipated closing of the sale of our Southern Africa downstream business later this year, we remain on track for asset sales proceeds of $1 billion to $3 billion in 2018. Turning to Slide 5. As many of you are aware, working capital effects impact our business unevenly throughout the year. These impacts are to a large degree transitory. Because of this uneven pattern by quarter, many of you exclude working capital impacts from your models. However, while uneven by quarter, our pattern is fairly consistent year-to-year. The chart drawn from this decade average working capital impacts demonstrates the pattern. Normally, working capital is a cash penalty in the first and second quarters followed by a cash benefit in the third and fourth quarters. The variation has at times been 2 to 3 times the quarterly average is shown. This reason is fairly consistent and may result from seasonal inventory builds and draws as well as the timing of the prior JV partner and tax payments. We anticipate this year\u2019s pattern to be no different. If price levels generally hold where they are today, we expect the majority of the $2.1 billion of working capital consumed during first quarter to be released throughout the remainder of the year. The residual is expected to be most of receivables related to both higher prices and higher production compared to 2017. Turning to Slide 6. First quarter 2018 results were approximately $950 million higher than first quarter 2017. Special items, primarily the absence of first quarter 2017 gains from the sale of our Indonesia geothermal assets coupled with the first quarter 2018 U.S. upstream asset impairment, decreased earnings by $720 million between periods. A swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings between the periods by $370 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased around $2.2 billion between the periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher listings. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by about $255 million, mostly due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects and lower volumes largely from the sale of our Canadian assets. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of the absence of prior year's favorable corporate tax items. As we indicated previously our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges, so quarterly results are like to be non ratable. Turning now to Slide 7, a beautiful chart as I do say so myself. This compares results for the first quarter 2018 with fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter results were approximately $530 million higher than the fourth quarter. Special items mainly from the absence of the fourth quarter 2017 U.S. tax reform gain, decreased earnings between periods by approximately $2 billion. While a swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $225 million between the periods. Upstream result excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by around $1.4 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations and listings along with lower depreciation and operating expenses. Downstream earnings excluding special items since foreign exchange, improved by about $540 million, reflecting higher earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the absence of fourth quarter 2017 hurricane impacts along with improved refining and marketing margins. The variance in the other segments largely reflects lower corporate charges and a favorable swing in corporate tax items between quarters. Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter production was 2.852 million barrels per day, an increase of 4.5% over average 2017 production and within our guidance range for 2018. This production level represents an all-time quarterly high for the company. Growth is expected to continue during 2018 with Wheatstone Train 2 coming online, major capital project such as Wheatstone, Hebron and Stamped ramping up and continued growth in our shale and tight assets. During the quarter, the impact of asset sales on production was negligible. In the second quarter, we forecast the quarterly asset sale impact of around 15,000 barrels per day, mainly from our recent Elk Hills and Democratic Republic of the Congo transactions. We\u2019ll also start our plan to turnaround activity in the second quarter. Our full year production guidance remains unchanged at 4% to 7% growth over 2017, excluding the impact of asset sales. On Slide 9, first quarter 2018 production was an increase 176,000 barrels a day or 6.6% from first quarter 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 228,000 barrels a day as we started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Wheatstone. Shale and tight production increased to 101,000 barrels a day, mainly due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian. Base declines net of production from new wells, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 39,000 barrels a day. The impact of 2017 asset sales, mainly in the U.S. midcontinent, Gulf of Mexico and South Natuna Sea, reduced production by 61,000 barrels a day. Entitlement effects reduced production by 50,000 barrels a day as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. Turning to Slide 10, Gorgon and Wheatstone delivered strong and reliable performance in the first quarter. First quarter net production was 202,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Gordon and 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Wheatstone. We shipped 69 LNG and four condensate cargoes, and were able to take it advantage of rising oil linked price, as well as strong Asia LNG spot prices, which averaged over $10 per BOE for the quarter. We continue to fine tune the plants to enhance reliability and boost capacity. These efforts are yielding favorable results. Gorgon first quarter production is more than 5% higher than our previous best quarter. And Wheatstone Train 1 has been running well. We have a planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2 next month to replicate performance improvement modifications that we have made in the other two trains. And work on Wheatstone Train 2 is progressing well and commissioning activities are ongoing. The warm end is expected to be ready for start up shortly and we\u2019re expecting begin LNG production this quarter. Dom gas is expected to start up late in the third quarter. Turning to the Permian. Permian shale and tight production in the first quarter was up about 100,000 barrel a day or 65% relative to the same quarter last year. Looking forward, we forecast Permian unconventional growth of 30% to 40% annually through 2020. All of this is premised on running 20 company-operated and approximately nine net rigs on NOJV properties by year end. In March, we guided to 2% to 3% annual growth from our base plus shale and tight business through 2022 at $9 billion to $10 billion of annual capital spend. We are currently running 17 rigs and expect to stand up our 18th company-operated rig next month. We also continue creating value through land transactions. We executed nine deals, swapping approximately 25,000 acres in the first quarter, and we have several others under negotiation. As you know, these laterals enable high-value longer laterals. We often get questions about our Permian takeaway capacity, as well as other questions on the industry macro environment. Mark heads up our Midstream and Strategy Group and will provide some additional insight. Over to you Mark. Mark Nelson : Thanks Pat. As Pat mentioned, we get questions these days about Permian related differentials, the long-term oil market and LNG supply and demand. So turning to Slide 12, let\u2019s continue with the Permian story. Where we believe optimizing the value chain from well head to customer differentiates Chevron from many in the business. As you know, our advantage starts with our land position and our factoring model, and continued with the market knowledge of each barrels value at any point in time and ends with the ability to appropriately place those barrels. For example, recent crew differentials in the Midland Basin have widened; and we\u2019ve secured flow and preserved margins by proactively procuring enough capacity to move product to multiple market centers; negotiating highly competitive transportation rates; batching and blending to meet market demands and avoid price discounts; and by accessing the best world markets for each barrels with our export capabilities. Simply said, our goal is to maximize the return on every Permian molecule. Another question that is often asked is reflected on Slide 13. And that is what role does oil play in meeting the world's growing energy demand in the decades to come. In developing our point of view, as you would expect, we use detailed internal and external analysis to evaluate supply-demand scenarios and the associated opportunities and risks in our business. Our macro liquids view is similar to a number of independent assessments, and we\u2019re showing one of these assessments, the IEA new policies scenario in the upper right. We believe that oil demand will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, and the need for incremental supply continues to exist in any realistic scenario. Reinforcing this view today is liquids demand continues to be in the higher end of most independent forecasts. The chart at the bottom right illustrates another of our points of view. We believe in a longer flatter supply curve. Despite the recent run-up in prices, we believe capital discipline, cost management and market signpost, will always matter. And we are well-positioned to win in any environment given our advantaged portfolio. Turning to Page 12 and the macro LNG view, this graph reflects the latest LNG demand projections from Wood Mackenzie with their supply forecast. Highlighting that the LNG market is becoming oversupplied in the short term as new projects continue to ramp up in both the Pacific and Atlantic basin. North Asian LNG demand, however, especially in China was stronger last winter than the market anticipated. In fact, 2017 Chinese gas demand was up 15% year-on-year with LNG imports up 46%. While this growth rate may moderate, the demand drivers appear mostly sustainable with coal to gas switching in residential and industrial applications mandated by the Chinese government to reduce air pollution. So the LNG market should rebalance with a supply gap expected to open before the middle of the next decade. And this is where Gorgon and Wheatstone capacity Creek and debottlenecking opportunities will fit very nicely. Only the most competitive cost competitive projects we\u2019ll be able to move forward in this space and we will be very disciplined with our investment, and we\u2019ll fund only those projects that will generate top returns. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Pat. Pat Yarrington : Let me close this out here on Slide 15. I would like to reiterate some of our key messages from our recent security analyst meeting and to demonstrate how we\u2019re delivering on those commitments. First, our cash generation improvement trend continues and is in line with previous guidance. In the first quarter, 2018 cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, was $7.1 billion well in access of our cash capital expenditures and quarterly dividend commitments. Second, we are executing a disciplined C&E program, allocating capital to the highest return projects that compete in our portfolio. Third, we grew production by 4.5% from full year 2017 to 2.85 million barrels a day, achieving an all time quarter high for the company and trending well within the guidance. Fourth, we have an advanced portfolio in the Permian Basin that is delivering on all cylinders. Year-over-year, we added the 100,000 barrels per day of shale and tight production here, trending ahead of recent guidance. And we\u2019re leveraging our mid stream business to maximize returns on every molecules. And lastly but very importantly, we increase the dividend per share by 4%, delivering on our number one financial priority to shareholders. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And Mark and I are now ready to take questions. Please keep in mind that we have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if necessary. And we\u2019ll certainly do our best to try to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, go ahead and open the lines please. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Pat, really great quarter just in terms of demonstrating the cash generation potential that Chevron has moving forward. And so I guess we actually get to the high quality question about what you would potentially do with discretionary cash flow. In the capital programs, obviously, we\u2019re disciplined, it\u2019s within a fairly tight range, balance sheet is about where you want it to be that leads us to share buybacks. And what would you potentially need to see to begin a repurchase program? Pat Yarrington : Jason, thanks for the question and thanks for acknowledging the good quarter. I think at this particular point in time, I\u2019m messaging around share repurchases really haven\u2019t changed from what we said just a few short six weeks or so ago. And at that time, we said we wanted to see the cash flow actually materialize. We said we wanted to see prices sustain a little bit. We do fundamentally believe that it is our fourth priority; and dividend growth is number one, leading the business is number two; the balance sheet, as you say, is number three; and surplus cash. Once we\u2019ve satisfied all those other commitments, it\u2019ll turn into a share repurchase program. It is part of the value proposition that we have offered shareholders in the past. As you know, 10 out of the last 14 years we have had share repurchases and we only stopped them during the financial crisis, and then in the last three years when prices there collapsed. So it's very much a part of the -- very much part of our thinking these days. And when we re-inaugurated if the circumstances permit that, we want to be able to do so in a sustainable fashion. Jason Gammel : Maybe just as my follow for Mark. Mark you mentioned the debottlenecking at Gorgon and Wheatstone would be towards the low end of the cost curve in the LNG supply stack. Do you see anything else in the portfolio that would potentially be competitive? And I guess I might even be referring specifically to expansion trends at even one of those projects. Mark Nelson : I think from Asia LNG perspective, the most exciting thing for us of course is the amount of demand that we\u2019re seeing in that part of the world. And it\u2019s probably premature for us to be thinking about extra trains as we have considerable opportunity moving from both ramp-up to debottlenecking. And having spent much of my career around refineries, I wouldn't underestimate the opportunity there and the size at the price. So we\u2019re focused on ramp up, efficient operation in the building our way into leveraging the existing infrastructure in Australia. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Cheng : I have two questions. I think that both of them for Mark. How much is the oil production from Permian that you are selling inside Permian in the first quarter? And what is your takeaway capacity for the next couple years? Have you already locked-in sufficient according to your current growth plan? And also we have heard some people talking about gas handling in the basin may start to become an issue. I want to see what is your view on that? So that's the first one. May as well have the second one is on the LNG market. Want to see whether you guys have been actively marketing or trying to market additional gas. And what's the conversation with the customer this day and what\u2019s the bid/ask differences, if there is any? Mark Nelson : Thinking about and I\u2019ll answer -- I'll address your Permian takeaway capacity question at the high level as you can imagine. We\u2019re very comfortable with our off-take positions today, and it goes all the way back to that advantaged portfolio and maybe equally importantly, disciplined developments. So it allows us to keep up with our production. And we do that by partnering with our strong infrastructure companies and we get highly competitive rates. And then they execute on infrastructure projects that quite frankly might not compete in our portfolio and we view that as activating our value chain at the lowest possible capital investments, which is a written driven mentality. We will hit moments of tightness and length, but we like our position moving forward. Paul Cheng : How about the gas handling? Mark Nelson : So from a gas perspective, all three streams so oil, gas and NGLs all must flow in the Permian. And as you know, the oil tends to drive the economics, but we have flow assurance across all three streams today. And again, we\u2019re comfortable with our position looking forward. Paul Cheng : But do you -- the basin as a whole will you have a problem, if not Chevron? Mark Nelson : From a basin perspective, you certainly have -- as we\u2019ve all read the news, you can see some competitors who perhaps don\u2019t have either the same discipline or the same advantage portfolio experiencing problems. But in the Permian, in general, most of those would be temporary. We see that as a region that will solve those type of problems and only have temporal challenges. On your LNG marketing question, as you know, we\u2019ve chosen to do business with some of the largest most reliable customers in that part of the world, and we have long-term contracts. And those -- the natural discussions that go on about wanting reliability and the best sustainable price continues as we would have expected. So we\u2019re seeing customers continuing to like the reliability that we\u2019ve been able to deliver and our flexibility in helping them with some of their operating challenges. So from our perspective, we see those relationships remaining very strong. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : My first question is just related to cost inflation across the portfolio. If you're seeing early signs of cost increasing, any comment specifically international versus U.S.? Pat Yarrington : I think that by enlarge the more material cost pressures that we have seen have been limited to the Permian and the U.S. unconventional market. The rest of the world, we\u2019re beginning to see some cost pressures but not of the same -- it\u2019s really as though future rates have declined and the rest of the world probably have stopped, and so you\u2019re probably leveling out there. So you\u2019re beginning to see a little tension there. Whereas in the Permian, you are actually beginning to see cost increases. I\u2019d like to take a moment though and acknowledge that we\u2019re largely protected in our Permian cost structure this year, because of the contracting strategies that we have followed. And this is again one of the benefits of having a 20 rig program that has been long planned and we\u2019re well disciplined around it. It\u2019s allowed us to line out all of the services and contract arrangements that we\u2019ve made it well in advance. And so we have about two thirds of our spending this year that\u2019s either occurring at known prices or indexed costs, or have cost containment capabilities built into them. Neil Mehta : And the follow-up question is just how do you get comfortable as a management team that the company has not under-investing, one of your peers is out taking a much more aggressive approach around capital spend over the next couple of years. And I guess one of the things that we hear when people push back on our view on the company is that the fear is that you\u2019re in harvest mode right now, but we\u2019re going to go into early next decade. And what are the projects that will drive the next wedge of ultimately cash flow growth enables you to replenish the portfolio and offset the decline. But just want you to respond to that narrative, because it\u2019s out there in the market. Pat Yarrington : I think the primary thing that I would say is we\u2019re not after a volume growth for volume growth sake, we\u2019re after growing volume. And we have a tremendous portfolio here. We showed a slide back in March that had 40 years of 2P resource development opportunity, and is very attractive resource that can be developed at relatively modest capital investment program. So we feel very comfortable about the portfolio that we have. And individually, we've got line of sight in the unconventional growth between now and into 2022. And then in 2022, we see the TCOs -- the TCO WPMP FGP project first production coming online. So for the next several years, we\u2019ve got line of sight on very good growth and frankly a portfolio that allows growth beyond that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question please. Doug Leggate : So I will take my two as well if I may Pat. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to open up with a buy back question again, just go back to that very quickly. Just philosophically, I'm guessing buybacks are not something you'd want to chop around quarter-to-quarter. So I guess my question is what level of -- what would management need to see to be comfortable to commence a buyback program, assuming you would need that to be ratable? And I'm thinking about level of cash on the balance sheet, whether quarter-to-quarter what we're seeing is a function of cash tax payments and interest charges and so on. At what point would you be comfortable to say okay, now we\u2019re ready to get going with this? Pat Yarrington : I mean it\u2019s hard to -- I don\u2019t want to put a quantification on this at this point, because I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the internal thinking on this. But clearly, we would have to have sustainability in a view of surplus cash generation. Beyond $18 billion to $20 billion capital program that we want to fund, beyond the growth rate that we anticipate around dividend. And as you say, our balance sheet is hovering in a very reasonable price at the moment. So we have to have a view of sustainability. And when I say sustainability, I don\u2019t just mean this quarter to next quarter to may be the third quarter out, but I really mean over a series of year. So we would like to be able to average in, dollar average in the cost of that share repurchase program, because we do have some shareholders who are not in favor of share repurchases, because of the concept that you only do them when you have the cash available. And when you have the cash available, your stock price is high. So the way that we can mitigate that is by having a very sustainable share repurchase program. So it really comes down to the longer-term or I\u2019ll say medium term generation, cash generating capability of the firm and expectations around that. Doug Leggate : So I am guessing a dividend takes a priority as you\u2019ve said previously\u2026 Pat Yarrington : Absolutely. Doug Leggate : So my follow-up is just a quick one. Obviously, you had a tremendous quarter relative to what the Street was expecting. And when you look through the presentation, there is a couple of comments in there about liftings in other, both U.S. and international. Can you just talk a little bit about what that was? Because were there some favorable timing issues in terms of sales versus production? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : Yes, I mean actually for the first quarter, we were slightly under lifted. So I think it\u2019s just a variance between the position of this quarter versus the prior quarter, very modes stance. I think part of the earnings improvement or the earnings speed that you might be highlighting really relates to depreciation. And in particular if you recall back we had 155% reserve replacement ratio in 2017 and that obviously allows you to, as you go forward, to lower your DD&A rate per barrel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : First question is a bit of a follow-up to Neil's just around the growth outlook through 2025. You do have some capital spending that will be rolling off after this year, Wheatstone and some other things. How do you think about where that wedge of -- assuming you're going to keep a CapEx cap in place through 2020 as promised. How do you think about where that extra cash flow might go between say adding more rigs in the Permian versus something like Gulf of Mexico where a peer of yours just sanctioned a project with $35 breakeven proposition? Pat Yarrington : I think that we really feel good about sticking to the 20 rig program in the Permian. We think there\u2019s still opportunity to lower development costs, lower operating costs there and maximize revenue streams out of that, so that will be a primary area of focus for us, getting really good efficiency out of that particular asset. If I think about other areas where there could be small incremental money spent, it would really be around the appraisal and pre fees, pre engineering work perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico. We have four potential areas of interest there and/or the areas of potential interest I guess I should say, Anchor, Tigris, Ballymore and Whale, and so that would be areas where we would look to do further evaluation. I should also mention that the development activity around other shales other than Permian, so in the Marcellus and Kaybob Duvernay, in Vaca Muerta, that could like -- those areas could likely pick up additional capital investment. Phil Gresh : And just one question on\u2026 Pat Yarrington : Can I just go back and mention one thing with regard to deepwater, so that people got misinterpret what I am saying here. We do have multiple opportunities that we can evaluate, but we would be very disciplined and very ratable be working on the pacing of any sort of development that we would do there. Phil Gresh : So the commitment to the $20 billion cap. Just one question on the quarter. One of your peers on cash flows reported a flip in their deferred tax from a headwind to a tailwind at these higher price levels. I was just wondering, you mentioned $1 billion headwind in the quarter from affiliates' earnings versus distributions, which is about half of the headwind you're expecting for the entire year. Just curious if deferred tax played out as you expected. Pat Yarrington : I would say directionally deferred tax played out as we were expecting. We did have -- it is influence as you might expect, rather timing of when you place out this as service and when you get bonus depreciation. In regard to the overall set of headwinds, I had given guidance back in March of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion as the headwinds for the year. But I had said at the time that if we felt working capital would be nil, I would say if prices hold where they are today, there will be a little bit of a penalty in working capital as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So you may want to think towards the -- certainly activity trending towards the higher end of that range that I gave you. I will say this is very hard for us to predict though, and so I do want to reserve the right every quarter to come back and give you an update. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simons and Company. Your question please. Guy Baber : Pat, I wanted to stick on the cash flow here a little bit, but the $7.1 billion in pre-work working capital cash flow seemed to be better than the framework you all gave at the Analyst Day when we adjust for commodity price. And I understand that 1Q is typically weaker given downstream seasonality and the affiliate dividend timing. So I just wanted to confirm that outperformance versus the internal plan. And I was wondering if you could isolate some of the key drivers of that better than expected cash flow. What sticks out to you all internally? And then with Brent at these higher levels here, just as a check. Do the general sensitivities you all have given still hold or do we need to rethink those a little bit? Pat Yarrington : Guy, I\u2019d say that the first quarter was really a very clean quarter, and it\u2019s a good basis I would say for you to build into your models going forward. I think we are running a little bit ahead perhaps on the guidance that we gave. I think first quarter is a good benchmark for you there. And the sensitivity that we had given from where dollar of improvement Bren on earnings, on cash flow is about 450 -- on earnings it\u2019s a little less than that. Guy Baber : And then I had a follow-up for Mark. So appreciate the view on the macro oil landscape here. Can you just talk a little bit maybe about what your base case expectations are from a high level. When you think about this decline in long cycle capital investment that's taken place for the industry over the last few years? So from 2013 to 2018, we've tallied up about 2 million barrels a day of major project capacity that started up per year on average and then that drops to around only 1 million barrels a day from 2019 to 2022 or so. So is the Chevron view -- do you see something similar? Do you see a supply gap emerging for the industry on the oil side over the next few years? And when might you see that beginning to show up in supply/demand balances? Mark Nelson : So first from a short-term perspective, obviously, we hit a space where the markets rebalanced and that's on the back of some fairly solid demand; in fact demand has surprised folks, most folks to the upside; and effective curtailment or planned or unplanned declines in certain countries around the world on top of geopolitics. So that\u2019s all short-term price support for today. We\u2019re not designing our business on these prices. We\u2019re driving our business for a lower for longer assumptions. And I think we\u2019re coming from a time where we\u2019re practiced at production coming from large investments versus short cycle activities. And as an industry, we do not forecast that, as well as we do the large projects. So we have a perpetual supply that\u2019s the industries that we\u2019re in. But I would expect prices to stay in a fairly tight range over time and we\u2019re going to design our business to deal with the lower end of those assumptions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please. Blake Fernandez : Pat, I wanted to go back -- you had mentioned the equity affiliate headwinds, and you\u2019ve addressed that. I guess what I was thinking specifically is on TCO. Is there an oil price level that you would actually begin to start getting distribution from that? Pat Yarrington : Actually Blake, we do still get distributions. It really is a determination that\u2019s made by the partnership council. It is not solely was in Chevron\u2019s control; but the partnership council folks; take a look at what are the requirements for funding the project that\u2019s under development; they take a look at what cash generation has been; they take a look at what the partners dividend interests are, and will negotiate basically to dividend declaration; and they can do that -- they review that multiple times during the course of the year; and they can do one dividend a year; and they can do a couple dividends a year, it\u2019s really the partnership council. Blake Fernandez : So it sounds like there is some flexibility and potentially could increase depending on what oil prices do? Pat Yarrington : Theirs is, we had a dividend last year, expectations are for a dividend this year as well. Again, it\u2019s not anything that we control uniquely within Chevron. Blake Fernandez : The second question, I'll just take advantage of Mark being on the call. But the 25,000 acres in the Permian that were transacted, it sounds like it was a swap. So I just wanted to confirm that your acreage position hasn't really changed overall. But I guess I was under the impression that a lot of those transactions had already come to fruition and you all were done. So are you still in the process of marketing and coring up? Mark Nelson : So you\u2019re right, there\u2019s mostly swaps were discussed in the materials that you saw, and never done, would be my answer in regard to potentially looking for ways to get longer laterals in the marketplace. From our perspective, we won\u2019t stop looking and we believe that\u2019s created considerable value for that disciplined execution that we talked about. And in fact, I would expect more transactions in the future in this space. Pat Yarrington : And I would just add. Swaps are often hard to put together just because you\u2019re trying to both parties optimize. So they may take a little bit longer duration to come to fruition. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Ryan Todd : Maybe a first quick one on the Permian, congrats on a great quarter, I think you guys may have blown out the Midland differential all by yourselves there. Can you talk a little bit about -- obviously, there are some timing issues here. But what drove some of the drivers of the particularly strong quarter-on-quarter performance in the Permian. Whether it was from particular areas, number of completions there, and how to think about the trajectory of that going forward? Pat Yarrington : Ryan, basically we had a large increase in the quarter, because we put several wells on production at the very tail end of 2017. We also saw increased NOJV activity. And the last point that I would make is that there can be -- it can be lumpy, the production increases that we show can be lumpy. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have you think that the increase from fourth to first quarter is something that would be repeatable or ratable necessarily. Ryan Todd : And then maybe -- we haven't talked about IMO2020. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you think about your relative positioning into it? And whether you would envision, or how you think about the attractiveness of any potential investments to take advantage of the situation. Pat Yarrington : I think the short answer is really that Chevron\u2019s position is pretty well placed, we\u2019re well positioned. We have complex refineries and we produce more distillates than fuel oil. We don\u2019t really produce much fuel oil in the U.S. We do have some exposure there around Asia. But the situation we\u2019ve got from a refining capacity standpoint, as well as the fact that we\u2019ve got midstream and trading capacity that we can optimize over the course of what we think will be an unstable market here as this rationalizes out puts us we think in a pretty good position. It\u2019s a little hard to understand exactly what the impacts are. So we continue to monitor what the industry response is going to be and what the actions are going to be taken by the various parties there. It\u2019s an unusual regulation in the sense of there is no single actor that\u2019s tagged with compliance. So there's multiple ways that compliance can occur, it can occur on the part of the shippers or that can occur on the part of the refiners. So it\u2019s a little hard to understand exactly how compliance will take place. Ryan Todd : But at this point, you guys wouldn't envision deploying any meaningful capital to the driven projects? Pat Yarrington : No we would not. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : Jumping in since I've got you, Mark and Pat on here. As we think about your ability to capture whatever differential exists between the Gulf Coast and the Permian. How should we think about that as flowing through your business? The reason I'm asking, Pat, is thinking about is it a realization and so we'll see it in the upstream part there, or does it flow through somewhere else? Just trying to maybe head off at the past concerns that in coming quarters realizations could look weak, but the overall number is fine. So how does it flow through on your upstream business? Pat Yarrington : It would come through the upstream, upstream realizations. Roger Read : So whether it\u2019s commercial pipeline or whatever other capture, it all stay in the upstream side? Pat Yarrington : That\u2019s correct. Roger Read : And then switching gears just since you put the chart up there with the longer flatter supply curve, you\u2019ve talked a little bit earlier about some of the Gulf of Mexico deepwater opportunities. Price wise, it looks like deepwater non-OPEC would be in the money here. So how do you think about when you're comfortable moving forward with an FID as you complete your studies on those various projects? Mark Nelson : So it\u2019s about priorities from our perspective in capital allocation. So the good news of having a portfolio that\u2019s so strong with the unconventional with short cycle high return investments, it makes all of the other projects, you have to compete to be brought forward. And I\u2019ve heard Jay Johnson say numerous times, the idea of changing outcomes and improving returns, and when you target a group of engineers on making a project have higher economics, it\u2019s amazing what can be developed for us to consider. But Pat, would you add to that? Pat Yarrington : So I would just say, first opportunity we\u2019ve got obviously is infill drilling and keeping existing facilities fully loaded here. And to the extent that there is a deepwater, a new reservoir found that can tie to existing facilities, obviously the economics there would be stronger. But we\u2019re working to get the development cost of greenfield down significantly. So standardizing on surface facilities, design one build many, standardizing along with the industry on subsea kit. We\u2019re also in a mode here now where we would be designing the production facilities, perhaps not the peak production but for the best capital efficiency, so longer subsea laterals. There\u2019s just an awful lot that we think we can do in the deepwater area to continue to get development cost down. But we have to see that actually materialize before we would be in a position to take an FID. We have a number of opportunities that are being evaluated, I\u2019d say at this particular point in time. And I can\u2019t really say which one is going to rise to the top first. But it\u2019s nice to have activity underway there and we\u2019re making good progress. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Your question please. Theepan Jothilingam : Just one question actually, coming back to the LNG performance. Could you talk about, just in terms of production both at Wheatstone and Gorgon, how sustainable is it to produce above that nameplate capacity? And just a follow-up question to that would be. Could you remind us in terms of the volumes from those two projects? Is all of it on long-term contracts or have there been some opportunities to, let's say, optimize some of that volume through pricing arbitrage? Thank you. Pat Yarrington : I would say, we have been spending time and effort and taking these pick stops in order to improve the reliability. For example, at Gorgon, we do think there\u2019s opportunities over time to expand capacity through debottlenecks and gain more capacity and gain more efficiency. So we\u2019re willing to make investments now to get to certain reliability and efficiency today. Longer term I think those debottlenecking activity that will be available to us. And in terms of the contracts, on Gorgon and Wheatstone, we\u2019re about 90% committed under long term contracts for those. Theepan Jothilingam : Was it particularly good quarter in terms of that remaining 10% or other charge or trading profit\u2026 Pat Yarrington : No, it was a good quarter. In terms of the spot cargoes, Asian spot prices on average were about $10 and so it was a very good quarter from a spot standpoint. Mark Nelson : So remember, that\u2019s only 10% of our production. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company. Your question please. Sam Margolin : Frank, I know you like to keep the call tight, but I would be remiss if I didn't say thanks and congrats as well. And my first question is just a mechanics question around the affiliates. I recall in the past some conversations that there would be a co-lending program that would functionally exclude affiliate spending from what we might think about as operating cash flow. Is that still a factor or has the Chevron level found more efficient uses of capital than that? Pat Yarrington : So the co-lending is really specific to the Tengiz project, and we have coal lending previously. Right now through 2019, we have had no requirement for any c-lending. With prices where they are today and if they stay at this level, it\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019ll be a co-lending requirement in 2018. It\u2019s something you should always have in the back of your mind. But with prices at this level, maybe that\u2019s something that won\u2019t materialize for 2018. The point of the co-lending, obviously, this project was inaugurated back in the lower price environment. And the point of the co-lending was to be able to assure and allow the fact that all partners being able to fund their share of the project. So it really has been dependent upon what prices have been and the ramp up of spend on the project per se. 2018 and 2019 be the peak years of spending for TCOs and investment projects, but 2018 so far has certainly been into a strong price environment. Sam Margolin : And then my follow-up is just, I guess it's for both Mark and Pat. The comments about thinking critically on Permian takeaway, I think resonate with the market, because it's come up among a lot of the independents. And given your view on LNG markets globally, how do you see U.S. LNG maybe playing a role, particularly with respect to the areas in the Permian more in the West Texas part of the Delaware basin that are a little gassier, if not is an operator, maybe as a partner or a customer of that solution? Mark Nelson : Well, from a macro perspective. Obviously, you'll see the company start to -- given some of the length that will occur in the region, you'll start to see people consider further investments in the Gulf in. And the Gulf coast have to compete with landed prices in Australia or in Asia. And from our perspective, we\u2019ve got such an advantaged position taking care of that Asian growth from our base assets in Gorgon, in Wheatstone that we\u2019ll watch what others do. We certainly have other LNG options around the world but all of it has to compete with landed price in Asia. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Rob West from Redburn. Your question please. Rob West : I'd like to go back to something you said earlier, Pat, which was about the surge in production in the Permian over the quarter. You attributed to more well completions. And the follow-up that put in my mind was can you say whether over the quarter you drew down your inventory of DUCs or whether they were still building. Just in terms of trying to assess the sustainability of that growth rate? That's the first one. I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Pat Yarrington : I think there was a modest reduction in DUCs during the quarter. But you have to think about it as being modest. Rob West : The second one is about Indonesia where I know you\u2019ve got an early stage gas project in the pipe. And one of your peers sanctioned a gas project that is this week I think, so topical. And I was wondering -- so I think that particular project you have, the holdup is really on license extensions. Is that right? If so, what's the timing on resolving those? And if it's not right, can you say anything about the other bottlenecks you still need to overcome there? Pat Yarrington : It\u2019s a called the Gendalo-Gehem project. And we have a new development concept, or we\u2019re reworking I guess the development concept, is the best way to say it; trying to recapitalize; work has been underway on that effort for the last several months; in fact probably more than a year at just particular point in time. So work is progressing on that. But I would also say that the contract extension is also an element here. And we\u2019ve express -- we've deliver an expression of interest to the government of Indonesia with regard to extent of the concession. So we want to make sure that it\u2019s a long lift project and we want to make sure that the combination of the development contract as well as the fiscal terms gives us the high return project. Rob West : Okay, thank you for those details. Pat Yarrington : Okay, I think that closes us off here. I would like to thank everybody on the call today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and everyone\u2019s participation. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Pat Yarrington : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are, Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.78 per diluted share. This is nearly $2 billion or roughly a $1 per share higher than the same period a year ago. The quarter included the impact of a non-recurring receivable write-down, which was offset by foreign exchange gains. A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.9 billion. Excluding working capital effect, cash flow from operations was $7 billion. The working capital penalty in the current quarter was understated by the $270 million receivable write-down as just mentioned as this was a non-cash item. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations has totaled $11.9 billion, about $3 billion more than a year ago. At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $39 billion, giving us a headline debt ratio of 20% and a net debt ratio of 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we currently yield 3.6%. Turning to Slide 4. In addition to the non-cash receivable write-down impact, our second quarter cash from operations position also requested a discretionary U.S. pension contribution of $300 million. When these two elements are taken into account to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison underlying cash generation improved between the first and second quarter by about $500 million. This improvement reflected higher Brent prices of about $7.50 per barrel and higher WTI prices of about $5 per barrel. Our upstream realizations did not fully capture the quarterly increase in global oil prices, largely due to portfolio mix effects surrounding the Brent WTI differential. We also saw lower Asia LNG spot prices during the quarter. Year-to-date, affiliate dividends were $1.8 billion less than earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 billion and $6.2 billion year-to-date, in line with our 2018 budget. We had 50% year-on-year improvement in operating cash flow from 2016 to 2017. We expect a similar improvement trajectory from 2017 to 2018. We anticipate second half cash generation will reflect higher production, strong upstream cash margins, additional proceeds from asset sales and some reversals of working capital requirements. These positives are expected be offset only modestly by another discretionary U.S. pension contribution. Turning to Slide 5. This favorable outlook on cash flow, combined with our ongoing commitment to capital discipline, enables us to initiate share repurchases, targeted at $3 billion per year. Our financial priorities are unchanged. We are generating cash surplus to what we need to meet the first three of these. We increased our annual dividend by 4% earlier in the year. We continue to be very selective and disciplined in our investments. And we have an advantaged portfolio and a large captured resource base. We plan to ratably develop these resources within the $18 billion to $20 billion capital range we previously indicated through 2020. Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We will take advantage of higher price period like we\u2019re seeing now to modestly reduce our debt level overtime. We\u2019ll start repurchases in the third quarter. Going forward, we will provide an update at the end of every quarter on our progress. We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios. Turning to Slide 6. Just a quick update on our portfolio optimization efforts. We have previously indicated our intent to generate between $5 billion and $10 billion in targeted asset sale proceeds over the three year period 2018 to 2020. We remain confident in this range. On a year-to-date basis, we have had sales proceeds of approximately $700 million, primarily from the sale of our upstream non-operated joint venture interest in the Elk Hills Field in California and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later this year, we expect to close the Southern African downstream transaction. When that happens, 2018 will be right on pace with our three year target. A few weeks ago, we announced our decision to market our UK Central North Sea assets. As with any transaction, we will only execute if we believe it is aligned with our strategic objective and we receive good value. Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter 2018 after tax earnings were $2 billion higher than second quarter 2017. Special item impacts were comparable in the two periods and hence do not show up as a variance bar in the aggregate for the enterprise. Favorable movements in foreign exchange positively impacted earnings between the periods by $262 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by approximately $2.3 billion between periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher lifting. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign exchange, decreased by about $400 million mostly due to an unfavorable swing and timing effect, higher operating expenses largely due to planned turnaround activity, lower Asia margins and the absence of our Canadian refining and marketing business. The variance in the other segment, excluding special items, was primarily the result of higher interest expense since less interest is being capitalized currently compared to the prior year. Turning to Slide 8. This compares results for second quarter 2018 with first quarter 2018. Second quarter results were approximately $230 million lower than the first quarter. For special items, the second quarter included the $270 million non-recurring receivables write-down, while the first quarter included $120 million asset impairment. Foreign exchange impacts were a positive variance of $136 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were essentially flat between the quarters. Higher realizations were offset by higher operating expense and DD&A. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign exchange, improved by about $80 million, reflecting higher volume and stronger U.S. West Coast refining and marketing margins. The variance in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges and lower capitalized interest. As I indicated last quarter, our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges and the quarterly results are not ratable with year-to-date charges of nearly $1.2 billion, we are trending in line with our earlier guidance. I'll now pass it on to Jay. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pat. On Slide 9, second quarter 2018 production was an increase of 46,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 180,000 barrels a day as we continue to ramp-up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased 91,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Base declines, net of production from new wells such in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 51,000 barrels a day. The impact for 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 77,000 barrels a day between the periods. Entitlement effects reduced production by 54,000 barrels a day as both rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. Planned and unplanned downtime, along with the impacts from external events, reduced production by 43,000 barrels a day during the quarter. Overall, the first half of 2018 production is up 4% relative to the first half of 2017. Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter production was 2.83 million barrels per day, taking our year-to-date production to 2.84 million barrels per day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date production growth was 4.5% higher than the daily average production for full year 2017. This is in line with our guidance. As Pat mentioned last quarter, planned turnaround activity across multiple locations began in earnest in the second quarter. The production impact from turnarounds in the second quarter was 67,000 barrels a day. We expect heavier planned turnaround activity in the third quarter. The production impact from 2018 asset sales was 15,000 barrels a day in the second quarter with a year-to-date impact of 8,000 barrels a day. With the successful startup for Wheatstone Train 2, continued growth in the Permian and ramp-ups at Hebron, Stamped and Tahiti vertical expansion project, we expect production to further increase in the second half of this year. Our outlook for the full year is expected to be in the top half of our guidance range even without normalizing for the impact of price at current levels. Turning to Slide 11, Chevron is now Australia's largest producer of LNG and the proud operator of five LNG trains with a total installed liquefaction capacity of 24.5 million tons per year. Our facilities, along with available capacity and other facilities in northwest Australia will enable us to monetize our world-class natural gas resource base for decades to come. Wheatstone Train 2 achieved first production in mid-June. The ramp-up has exceeded expectations as Train 2 reach nameplate capacity within weeks of startup. We've already exported the equivalent of six cargoes of Train 2 production, and we\u2019re planning to take a pit stop in the third quarter to remove the start up strainers. Its companion plan, Wheatstone Train 1, has also been running well. The train has demonstrated nameplate capacity and has now run 195 consecutive days without a day of downtime. We also successfully completed the planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2. The Gordon pit stops have been successful and we\u2019re seeing improvements in performance and reliability. As a casing point, Gorgon Train 1, since its pit stop, has run more than 285 days without a day of downtime. Combined net production from our operated LNG trains was 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. With Wheatstone Train 2 ramping up and Gorgon Train 2 back online, we\u2019re already seeing net production approaching 400,000 barrels per day. Let's turn to Slide 12. I recently returned from a trip to Kazakhstan. Our base business at TCO is running well and FGP WPMP project is progressing as guided towards first production in 2022. The project is estimated to be 40% complete with preassembled pipe racks, process modules and a gas turbine generator all in transit from yards in Kazakhstan, Korea, and Italy. Six pipe rack modules have been successfully delivered to sites, demonstrating the operability of the delivery system and the receiving facilities. Site work continues to focus on foundation, undergrounds and infrastructure in preparation for module installation. Major mechanical, electrical and instrumentation contracts have been awarded. We also have three drilling rigs operating on multi-well pads, and drilling is ahead of schedule. If you recall back in March that I said 2018 is a critical year for execution. This is the first year of module fabrication and site construction, as well as initiation of the module transportation system. With engineering approaching 85% complete and fabrication of 40% complete, we are seeing cost pressure on the project. Site productivity remains a key driver of success for the project and is a major focus for our team. Turning to the Permian, on Slide 13. Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing an increase of about 92,000 barrels a day, up 50% relative to the same quarter last year. Our development strategy continues to center around disciplined execution and capital efficiency. We\u2019re currently running 19 rigs and our development program is progressing as planned. While activity levels are high in the Permian, Chevron has not experienced supply shortages in the second quarter. And we\u2019re securing the dedicated crews and materials needed to execute the plan we\u2019ve previously described. We continue to focus on well performance and the optimization of our well factory. This requires coordination and planning, starting with our land position, running through the drilling and completion strategy, as well as the design and construction of facilities. And it ends with the midstream arrangements to ensure that we bring produced oil, gas and NGLs to market at competitive realizations. Turn to Slide 14. We\u2019re currently operating eight development areas and participating in approximately 30 joint venture developments operated by others. We continue to proactively manage and strengthen our land position. Year-to-date, we've transacted 31,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales. We've previously mentioned that some of the highest value transactions are swaps that allow us the core of acreage and enable long length laterals. As the land transaction example on the right depicts, coring-up acreage provides an opportunity to double the lateral length of each well and optimize facilities, which in turn, lowers our unit development cost. In this case, the acreage swap increase the number of long-length lateral wells we can drill by approximately 600, and improve the forecasted internal rate of return for each well by more than 30%. Since 2016, we've increased our average lateral length per well in the Permian by approximately 35%. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to core-up acreage and improve the capital efficiency of our Permian program. Let's turn to Slide 15. Last quarter, Mark discuss the value of being an integrated company, and our strategy for maximizing returns in the Permian. Chevron has secured from transport capacity at competitive rates to move the equivalent of nearly all of our forecasted 2018 and 2019 operated and NOJV taking kind oil production to multiple markets, including the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result of these contractual arrangement and long-term planning, this equivalent production is not materially exposed to the Midland basis differential. Our share of NOJV oil production not taken in kind is approximately 20% of our Permian crude volumes. We previously mentioned that the pipeline takeaway capacity and production don't always move in perfect lockstep, they'll be periods of tightness and length. As an example, in June, we had more than 50,000 barrels a day of excess takeaway capacity out of the Midland basin, which we monetize through purchases of third-party volumes. We expect that excess capacity to attenuate through the rest of the year as our production continues to grow. Agreements are in place to access additional pipeline capacity in early 2019 in line with our production growth forecast. In July, we utilized firm dock capacity in the Houston ship channel to gain access to world markets for Permian source crews. We have firm contractual arrangements in place to further increase that dock capacity in 2019. Overall, we've exported more than 8 million barrels of liquids from the Gulf Coast in 2018, further demonstrating our midstream's ability to batch, blend, trade and export to secure the highest value for our products. We\u2019re developing processing arrangements for NGLs and we have flow assurance for natural gas to ensure the production will not be impacted. We are moving forward with our development plans in the Permian, and we do not intend the slowdown activity or divert capital. Pat, back to you. Pat Yarrington : Okay, just a couple of closing comments about the first half and expectations for the remainder of the year. Cash from operations, excluding working capital is materializing as expected, given the market conditions, production levels and asset reliability that we have achieved. The picture for total cash flow in the second half looks promising as well. We expect second half upstream cash margins to improve and our 2018 projected volume increases are backend loaded, giving us confidence that our full year product outlook is trending towards the upper half of the guidance range. In addition, we should we see some relief in working capital and additional asset sales proceeds. Capital spending is on budget for the first six months. And so in total, we have a very attractive offering for investors; a growing dividend, assets that are strong cash generators, a healthy balance sheet and finally, sufficient free cash flow to enable a share repurchase program. In short, we are delivering on all of our commitments. So that concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we have a lot of folks on the queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up, if necessary, and we will certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, go ahead and open the line please. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Thank you very much, and congratulations on the buyback. It's great to see you\u2019re making this step. I want to start there and see how you guys were framing the $3 billion number. How did you arrive at that being the right level? And to your point about this being an every year number, how should we think about this? Should we think of this as a base load fixed cost, if you will, on a go-forward basis in any foreseeable price environment? Or is this more of a flywheel dynamic? Pat Yarrington : You hit upon in a way you asked the question some of the keywords for us, which really are, we do want this to be a sustainable element here. So we obviously took a look at multiple price scenarios and we felt that this level of sustainability -- we could handle this almost through any reasonable price environment there. We pay attention to what expectations are in the market. And you can see, if you look at the futures market, there is a bit of peak this year next year and then maybe some downward trend. So obviously, that\u2019s a scenario that we took into account. And with that we felt that the $3 billion level was sustainable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : Yes, good morning. I echo Neil's sentiment. Congratulations on the buyback. I guess it's somewhat of a follow-up question. You gave helpful color around cash from operations. It sounds like it supposed to be up 50% year over year, I think is what you said. And so that would be about $30 billion of CFO. If I look at that on a post-dividend, post-CapEx basis, you'd have about $9 billion of post-dividend free cash flow. And so it sounded like you said in your prepared remarks there is also maybe some desire to pay debt down a little bit. But just wondering how you think about that? Obviously, a third of this incremental is going back to the shareholder. But are you trying to save money for a rainy day? Or how do you think about that considering you also have asset sale proceeds coming up? Pat Yarrington : I think it\u2019s a great question and you are trying relating on the numbers quite accurately there. All I would like to say just from the start, we\u2019d like to hit the cash in the door and see it before we over commit on it. So there might be a bit of conservatism here in how we started. But if you step back and think about the price environment that we\u2019re in and the price environment that may be expected as that market is telling us over the next couple of years that maybe coming, which would be a lower price environment. We think it's prudent at this point in time to strengthen the balance a bit sheet when commodity prices are high. And so we do anticipate a little bit of debt pay down over the next period of time. We\u2019re certainly in a comfortable position from a leverage standpoint. But paying it down a little bit and showing up the balance sheet little bit, we think would be an improvement -- or we'd have willingness to go there to a small degree. Obviously, if you're building up cash little bit and paying down debt little bit, it gives you a bit of an insurance policy, when times get tougher to meet the commitments that you've already laid out there. And by that I mean the commitments that you put out there in terms of dividends and also now the commitment we have around share repurchases and the sustainability we hope to have around share repurchases. I don't -- they don't have the same level of commitments, share repurchases are the fourth in our priorities, dividends come first. But obviously, we\u2019d like to have as much readability and predictability around share repurchases as we can. Phil Gresh : If I could ask a quick follow-up, just on the production guidance, you\u2019re comfortable with the high end of the range. Despite, I think Jay said, despite the entitlement effects, which I think in the second quarter, is 2% year-over-year impact. So maybe you can just provide some color around what you think is going better than your expectations? Is it all Permian or are there other things as well? Jay Johnson : So I think the primary thing that gives us some confidence is that we started out Wheatstone Train 2 very late in the second quarter. It has come up very cleanly and is running well. We continue to see growth in the Permian and we have ramp-ups going on, as I said, on a number of capital projects. We have some turnaround activity in the third quarter, which will be bit of a drag on production. But as we move through that, and as we move into the fourth quarter, overall, with these new projects coming online and our relatively low base decline, we really feel pretty comfortable about where we are in our production profile through the rest of the year, barring unforeseen events. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Cheng : Jay, did I hear you correctly. You were saying that turnkey, you are seeing some cost pressure or sign of cost pressure. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how big -- is that really going to be a big problem or what [material] we\u2019re talking about and where is the source of the cost pressure? Jay Johnson : So we are seeing some cost pressure. We are now, as I said, approaching 85% complete on the engineering. We\u2019re about 40% complete on fabrication. We\u2019re having a full-year of construction in the field. Where we are seeing some cost pressures at this point in time, our engineering program has cost more than we would have been anticipated. We had some design quality issues but also our productivity overall has been lower on engineering than expected. We've also seen some of our major contracts come in for field construction a little higher than what we expected. When we put all that together, we are using more of the contingency at this point in time than we would have expected or anticipated, and so that signals that we\u2019re seeing cost pressure on the project. We've talked about getting through this season. We really need to see how the performance goes. There is a lot of important milestones. The good things that are happening, the fabrication is really working well. We are seeing high quality come out of the modules and sales as they are being completed and shipped to Tengiz. We successfully tested the logistics system and we have delivered modules all the way to sites. So those things are all working quite well. But what we need to do is we are 40% complete on this project. It's large, it's complex and we've used more of the contingency at this point than we would've expected. So that tells us we have cost pressure on this project. We will continue to access it and we will update you accordingly as we need to. Paul Cheng : And at what point that you will be more certain whether you have to raise your overall budget? Is it six months from now? Where is the maybe the critical path that you need to pass in order for you to know whether that you will be able to stay within the budget or it's going to be higher? Jay Johnson : We continue to assess our performance Paul, as we move through the project. This is a 5, 6 year project overall duration. So, we are still relatively early in the project. The site productivity is really going to be important. And as we go through this year and can really assess where we are and look at that site productivity, it is a full-court press in the field to really make sure we are making the progress, but in making that progress using the number of man-hours and the resources that we expected. So, we are very focused on the timely delivery of engineering and engineer design and bulk materials. We want to make sure that we've got our crews ready that the workforce planning is in place and that we have sufficient support of our workforce, so that we get the most out of that crew. So, it's hard to put a definite time on it. We will continue to monitor our performance. We build these into our business plan. At this point, I do not see it impacting our guidance of 18 billion to 20 billion. And we will keep you updated as we gain more information. Paul Cheng : My second question. Jay, when you guys do economic analysis, do you primarily use the real price? Or are you using the nominal price as the base case? Jay Johnson : The real price of oil do you mean? Paul Cheng : Yes. Jay Johnson : We have a corporate price forecast which we use as our basis for our economic assumptions, but more importantly, we also test our business plan against both higher and lower price scenarios to make sure that we have a robust plan that takes into account. The one thing we do know with certainty is that we cannot predict the oil price. So, we want to plan that really is able to respond and adjust accordingly with options for whatever the price turns out to be. Paul Cheng : I'm sorry that I probably didn't make myself clear. When I say real price, means that the price adjusted for inflation. Do you build in an inflation factor, whatever is the price deck that you use? Or you just use a nominal flat price in your assumptions? So when you guys previously saying that Tengiz would be a $60 or low $60 Brent price would be generating a 10% return or 15% return, is that the price is based on inflation adjusted or nominal? Pat Yarrington : It's based on inflation adjusted. I mean we look at what we expect price is to be because the costs out estimates that we are putting together have those kind of components built in. But when we are taking the project to evaluation when we are doing the final investment decision, we look at a whole host of price scenarios and we look at both nominal and real outcomes. What would you have to believe to have a 10% rate of return in a nominal sense? What would you have to have it in a real sense? So, we look at the economics and judge the value of the project based on multiple price scenarios. But when we are actually putting out an FID kind of number, it is our best estimate of what that cost at that point in time will be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : I've got two questions, if I may. I guess the first one is an upstream question. When you laid out the Analyst Day back in March, obviously you kept your guidance through 2020. And if we take, Pat, what you said about the buyback being sustainable, it seems at least on our numbers in the current oil price environment you have got a lot more headroom in terms of surplus cash. But I'm curious, what are your intentions post 2020? Should we expect the current level of spending to be sustained? Or is that headroom to allow for, let's say, another step-up in project visibility as we go beyond, for example, Tengiz as we go beyond 2020? I've got a quick follow-up, please. Pat Yarrington : Dough, I think I'll just start and say, we feel good about the $18 billion to $20 billion range out through 2020. Because we can see our way forward that far with the quality of the resource base we have, the production profile that we've got laid out for the Permian, and other unconventional. Our ability to take what is relatively a less mature asset base like LNG and debottlenecking and see continued value growth there, we have a whole series of investments that we can see lined out that our current portfolio gives us opportunity to develop economically and that's why we feel comfortable about the $18 billion to $20 billion range. When you get beyond 2020, we really will have to have a review of other incremental projects that we would like to bring online. At some point, we believe that there will be the opportunity to add deepwater investment. For example, those are competing now or they're working to get their cost structure down, so that they can compete better in the portfolio that time will come. We've said in the past that we want to be ratable in terms of how many we bring on bring those on at what time frame and what sort of pacing we do. So, that's all stuff that we will put together as we are looking at our 2019 to 2021 plan, and as all information that we will try to come out and provide a little bit more guidance for when we get to our Security Analyst Meeting in March 2019. But for now, I think the key message is $18 billion to $20 million that's the capital program that's the capital discipline that were living within. Doug Leggate : Jay maybe I can follow-up with you specifically than on another potential source of cash because you guys have obviously got tremendous flexibility with the Permian, but it is also very early and your 5 billion to $10 billion disposal plan and since you laid that out the oil prices obviously recovered quite a bit so, so I guess what I'm asking Jay is it that upside to your disposal target, how is the change in oil price changed your view of what's covered in the portfolio and I'll leave it there. Jay Johnson : I would say that as we look at assets that are going to be part of our portfolio work, we tend to look at assets that are approaching end of life or either very early in life. So early in life would be resource opportunities that we have that just don't compete for capital in the portfolio. They maybe economic, quite of economics, but they don't compete for capital and or trying to be very disciplined about what projects we invest and only invest in the top part of our queue. The projects that are very late in life tend to have limited resource potential left for us and those are the ones we are putting out there that higher prices certainly help. But I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance at this point in time. This is going to be a pretty ratable program. It's a pretty normal part of our operation to continue to look at properties as they move through their lifecycle and decide when do they need to exit the portfolio. Our overall focus on all of this, we are not driving your production target we are driving to improve our returns and lead the industry and our returns on the upstream assets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Jay, it's very positive comments on the operations in Australia essentially reaching nameplate capacity already. And obviously, very long duration runs on several of the trains. I guess my question is given this performance, how should we think about utilization rates in 2019 on the LNG facilities, recognizing that obviously some maintenance still needs to be done? But that there are probably some debottlenecking opportunities in the near term that you might be able to take advantage of? Jay Johnson : Yes, we have not issued any formal guidance around this yet. We are going through the business plan now when we really develop that. But I would say that we took all the knowledge from the Gordon Train 1 and apply that to 2 and 3. We have gone through the pit stops now. So, we are really pretty comfortable with where these trains are and we just need to get some run time and do the analysis to see where the opportunities are for further expansion. One of the best ways to extend the capacity of these trains of course is just keeping them fully online and fully utilize and so that's our primary focus at the moment. Wheatstone is a very similar story. Train 1 started up we had a pretty clean startup but taking all those lessons learned train 2 was started up very cleanly and at this point in time, we do not have any anticipation of taking those down. So we may have from time to time as we said before, you know some of the small pit stops if we see economically driven opportunities to enhance performance as we have done, but overall I think a lot of the other than routine maintenance a lot of the unknown shutdowns at this point in time are behind us. We will get into a regular rotation of shutdowns as all major trains do and that's on our three or four-year cycle as we get these and we want to have them staggered out. But that's all being sorted out in our business plan and for now we would expect to see some pretty good sustained runs on these trains. Jason Gammel : That's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Jay, could you comment on timing on first production at Big Foot and whether you are actively engaged in restarting production in the PZ? Jay Johnson : Yes, so at Big Foot, we still expect to see production started later this year. We have made good progress. We got the platform successfully installed in storm safe, as you know early in the first quarter of this year. The drilling program is underway. We are completing the first 12 and we are moving through and just about bring buyback gas into the facility to start the final commissioning. So later in this year, we will expect to see production at Big Foot. We've already run, in fact, some of the second riser just to make sure loop currents aren\u2019t a factor for us in that program. As we look at the PZ, of course it's an ongoing issue that the two governments are working to resolve. Our focus is on making sure that we are keeping the facilities and are ready to restart mode. We are very focused on asset integrity and preservation types of activities. We have also done a lot of engineering and use this time of downtime to model, not only a more comprehensive reservoir set of models, but also the surface facilities and really identified all of the opportunities of low hanging fruit to optimize the flow once we get the facilities back online. So, I think there is a lot of good opportunities for us when it restarts. We remain ready to go and off course we will support the governments as they work towards resolution. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : If we could, Jay, maybe come back to the Midland Delaware Basin, the takeaway. And then you've been over the last several quarters exceeding the guidance range that was laid out at the Analyst Day. So I was just curious, as you think about the capacity to take away, both on the oil and gas side, the fact you are running ahead of the guidance range. Does that create any risk? And then the second part of my question is as you move non-operated or non-produced barrels that 50,000 barrels a day, and replace them with your own. How does that flow through in terms of performance? I would assume better cash capture, cash margin capture, on your own barrels than third party, but I was just curious how that works out. Jay Johnson : So I'll take the first question or first part of the question. The higher production that we're seeing from our operations is taking into account. Our midstream group and our business unit, they are in daily conversation about where we are, what our updated forecast look like, so that we don't catch anyone by surprise. The midstream group has done an outstanding job of working with various suppliers and services in areas for our takeaway capacity. We have adopted the strategies and our focus is on maximizing returns from the Permian, and that's what drives all of our efforts. So where we have had opportunities to not invest our capital, but rather contract for service like pipelines and takeaway capacity, our gas plants and things where we can tariff through someone else capital at a better rate, we've chosen to do so. But that means we have to be very coordinated with all these various suppliers to ensure the capacities in place, and accommodating our growth plans. So at this point in time we look very good through 2018 and 2019. We just will continue to monitor this there is periods of tightness, periods of excess capacity and we look to take opportunity to acquire other crudes and move them through those lines when the opportunities present themselves in the form of the differential exceeding the tariff. I do think in terms of the -- when we think about the NOJV, we almost have to think of the upstream producers into the Midland basin -- into the Midland area. And then our midstream takes crude from the Midland area and moves it to markets and that are crude and others crude. So it's really a big machine but it's hard to say one specific barrel moves through the system. It's, more of a commercial arrangement and equipment volumes. Our goal is to make sure that we are getting the maximum returns for the barrels that we produce, whether they're non-operated or operated barrel, as we move those to the various markets. The other thing that our midstream has done it's been really helpful is not just get pipeline capacity out of the basin into the various markets, but then they have also made arrangements, so that we can move this as we said across the doc into ships and access world markets as well. And so, it really lets us take a forward look at those markets and adjust our off-take as we need to maximize our realizations. Pat Yarrington : And I wanted to add one of the benefits of being an integrated company and it's also one of the benefits of being a company that focuses on a longer-term plan. We have been under this plan of the 20 rig rate in the Permian for a quite some time. And all of these precursors have been lined out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Your question please. Theepan Jothilingam : A couple of questions, actually. Firstly, I think you gave guidance at the Analyst Day on the headwinds in the cash flow of somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. So I just wanted to know whether that guidance is still valid and how much of those headwinds have been consumed in the first half. And then the second question. I think we've been given an update in terms of the uncon business, particularly for the Permian. But I was just wondering how the rest of the unconventional business, the Duvernay Argentina is looking as one reviews the last six months. Pat Yarrington : I\u2019ll take them in order I think. So, yes, good question about the headwinds. So year-to-date, through this first six months we are sitting at combined headwinds of about 3.6 billion. The guidance that I had given back in March was between 2.5 and 3.5. Actually, I think that is still good guidance may in fact come in a little bit lower, I mean a little bit towards the low end of the range. What we are seeing here with higher prices is that the differed tax headwind that we thought would materialize at lower prices is really almost turning into, essentially turning into a tailwind here at higher prices, and that\u2019s exactly what you would expect. So bottom line somewhere between 2.5 to 3.5 but probably closer to the bottom end of that range. Jay Johnson : And as far as our other unconventional activities, we have continued to see very good progress in all three of the assets. I\u2019ll just walk through them one at a time. The three rigs we've increased from two to three rigs down in Argentina worked very well with our operator YPF. We are seeing continued improvement in our performance down there. The economic returns are looking very strong. I think what's really important in Argentina is they continue to deal with some of their situation. Maintaining an open market will be an important watch point for us as we continue to move forward with our operations in the Vaca Muerta. We also have a field called El Trapial, which was a conventional field that\u2019s in the northern part of that area. And we are planning to do in an eight well pilot for the unconventional potential under El Trapial, and there is a lot of expectation that that may also improve to be a good area for us from an unconventional sense. We have restarted our drilling campaign in the Marcellus. We took a couple of year holiday just to reduce our capital during the last couple years. So, we are now moving back in the operation there, and the initial results coming out of the Marcellus as we picked up right where we left off and continued our march to lower our unit development and operating cost. So I'm pretty pleased with what we are seeing in the Marcellus and Utica areas. And then finally, up at Kaybob DuVernay in Canada we are also seeing good performance from our crews up there. We have moved from largely a land tenure and assessment of appraisal drilling mode into our first factory mode and have our first development area, that\u2019s about 55,000 acres that we started on in November 2017. So, as we shift from moving rigs around and appraisal drilling to actually development drilling, we expect to see that continued improvement in performance there. One of the things that has been really successful for us over the last two or three years has been bringing these various teams together they need on a regular basis best practices are shared between the different areas. So while they all have different characteristics, there is far more in common than there is different. And the techniques, the best practices, the use of data analytics, just a lot of the experience that we gain on a daily basis instead of just being in one area now were deploying that across all four and it doesn\u2019t just flow from the Permian outward. Things like zipper fracking actually came from the Marcellus into the Permian and so, we see that leveraging of knowledge and experience is quite powerful and very valuable force us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. As you are working to expand Gorgon, I know that the Australian government is prioritizing more domestic gas supply, particularly for the eastern states in the country. And how do you kind of balance out your higher export demand with the fact that there is a brewing shortage domestically in the market? Jay Johnson : We would love to sell them LNG to start with, but what's really important for Australia as with country is energy security. You always want to make sure your country has efficient supply of clean, affordable, reliable energy source. And so in the West Australia, there is no pipeline, there is no way to transport gas from the west to the east. Other than through LNG, we continue to produce LNG. We have extensive gas resources in the west 50 trillion cubic feet of gas as Chevron equity gas. Our focus is on making sure we have domestic gas plants at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. We have plenty of capacity to supply the west Australia, but we also are really focused on making sure that we move and monetize that gas resource to the various markets that are demanding in. So, at this point, I don't see the East Coast problems having any impact on either the expansion or the delivery from west Australia. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. A quick follow-up on your monetization plans. You mentioned some of the upstream assets. Given the very hot demand these days for Permian midstream capacity, is that something that you would consider including in your divestment planning? Jay Johnson : We don't really have midstream assets per say in the Permian area. We have been focusing on the upstream that's where we see highest value and highest returns and are takeaway capacity in the midstream processing like gas plants NGLs is provided by third parties. Pat Yarrington : Okay, thank you very much. I think that concludes the queue here. So, I guess, we're already to end the call. I'd like to thank everybody for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate the questions that came in. Thank you very much. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead. Patricia E. Yarrington: All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pierre Breber, Executive Vice President, Downstream & Chemicals; and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. But before I get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements and we ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $2.11 per diluted share. This is more than $2 billion higher than the same period a year ago and this is the highest recorded earnings per share since third quarter 2014. The company's year-to-date earnings were $11.1 billion or $5.79 per diluted share. This was $5 billion higher than the same period a year ago. The quarter included the unfavorable impacts of a project write-off, an impairment, and a nonrecurring contract settlement, which totaled $930 million. These were partially offset by a $350 million gain on the sale of our Southern African refining and marketing assets. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $51 million. A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings totaled $4.7 billion or $2.44 per share. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $9.6 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from operations was $9.2 billion. Cash flow from operations continued to grow in the third quarter and was the highest it has been in nearly five years, back when Brent crude prices were averaging about $110 per barrel. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $21.5 billion, about $7 billion more than a year ago. At quarter-end debt balances stood at approximately $36 billion, giving us a debt ratio of 19%. During the third quarter we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we repurchased $750 million of our shares during the quarter. We currently yield 4%. Turning to Slide 4. Our third-quarter cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, increased to $9.2 billion, reflecting higher realizations and growing volumes in our U.S. and international upstream. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, totaled $23.3 billion. This included $600 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions, $800 million in deferred income taxes, and affiliate dividends approximately $2.5 billion less than equity affiliate earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion and $9.8 billion year-to-date. The result, free cash flow excluding working capital effects of $5.6 billion for the quarter and $13.5 billion year-to-date. Through the first three quarters of the year, normalized for $60 Brent, we are on track to deliver the $14 billion cash generation guidance communicated at the Analyst Meeting in March. Turning now to Slide 5, a view of our sources and uses of cash through the quarter. We are delivering on all four of our financial priorities. We maintained our commitment to competitive dividend growth by paying out $2.1 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders. We continue to fund our highest return projects at a reasonable pace. We further strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by $2.4 billion, lowering our debt ratio to 19%. And finally, we commenced our share repurchase program in the third quarter and returned $750 million of surplus cash to shareholders. Now on Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. Through the third quarter. We received before tax asset sale proceeds of $1.9 billion, including the divestment of our Southern African refining and marketing business. Most recently, we signed sale and purchase agreements including the sale of our 12% non-operated interest in the Danish Underground Consortium and the sale of our 40% interest in the Rosebank project west of Shetlands in the UK. In addition, we continue the process of marketing our UK Central North Sea assets. As with all divestments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we have made year-to-date on portfolio optimization puts us on track to generate $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds over the 2018 to 2020 time period as we guided back in March. Turning to Slide 7, third quarter 2018 after tax earnings $4 billion were approximately two times that of third quarter 2017. Special Items reduced earnings by approximately $1 billion between periods. In the current period, special items included a gain on the sale of South African R&M assets. The write-off of the Tigris project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an impairment on an asset held for sale, and a non-recurring contractual settlement. All of which netted to a negative $580 million. In third quarter 2017, special items included a gain on the sale of Canadian R&M assets, less project write-offs, for a net positive impact of $455 million. Foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $61 million between periods. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by almost $3.5 billion between the periods or about five times, mainly on improved realizations and higher liftings. Oil prices were approximately 45% higher in the current period than a year ago. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by about $100 million. This reflected lower margins in Asia and in the U.S., along with foregone contributions from our Canadian downstream assets which were sold. Favorable timing effects and higher earnings from CPChem were partially offsetting. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of higher corporate tax items and interest expense. Turning to Slide 8, this compares results for third quarter 2018 with second quarter 2018. Third quarter results were approximately $600 million higher than second quarter. Third quarter special items as detailed previously, when compared to second quarter's non-recurring receivable write-down, resulted in a net negative variance between the quarters of $310 million. Of about equal size was an adverse swing in foreign exchange impacts between the periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $1 billion between the quarters due to higher liftings and improved realizations. During the quarter we were in an overlifted position but on a year-to-date basis we are modestly underlifted. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange improved by almost $240 million, reflecting lower operating expenses, particularly those associated with the second quarter turnaround at the Pascagoula Refinery. Favorable timing effects were also evident between periods. Turning to Slide 9, third quarter production was 2.96 million barrels a day, our highest ever production for a quarter. This moved our year-to-date production to 2.88 million barrels a day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date production growth through the third quarter was 6%higher than the daily average production for full year 2017. As Jay mentioned on our last quarter call, we had planned turnaround activity across multiple locations in the third quarter. The production impact from these turnarounds was 103,000 barrels per day. 2018 asset sales impacted third quarter production by 18,000 barrels a day and impacted year-to-date production by 12,000 barrels per day. At year end we expect to be at the top of our original guidance range, approximately 7% growth excluding the impact of asset sales. And this is even without normalizing for the impact of current prices on production sharing contracts. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter 2018 production was 2.96 million barrels per day, an increase of 239,000 barrels a day, or 9% from third quarter 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 237,000 barrels per day, as we continued to ramp up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone, Gorgon and Hebron. Shale and tight production increased 155,000 barrels per day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, where production grew by 80% from a year ago. Base declines, net of production from new wells, such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 6,000 barrels a day. Major turnarounds, along with planned and unplanned downtime reduced production by 59,000 barrels per day between the periods. Entitlement effects reduced production by 41,000 barrels a day due primarily to rising prices between the periods. The impact of 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 31,000 barrels a day between the periods. Now on Slide 11, Gorgon and Wheatstone continued to operate very well. Combined, these plants averaged 379,000 barrels a day of production during the quarter. This is a 35% increase over the previous quarter. We had two planned maintenance activities on Wheatstone during the quarter, a scheduled compressor overhaul on Train 1 and a startup strainer removal on Train 2. These reduced production by approximately 21,000 barrels a day on average over the quarter. We are finalizing the commissioning of the Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect first sales in first quarter 2019. For this gas, production and sales activity will be dependent on local demand. With all five Australian LNG trains running reliably, we're focusing on finding opportunities to incrementally add production and enhance reliability. Turning to the Permian, on Slide 12, Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 338,000 barrels per day, representing an increase of 150,000 barrels per day. Let me say it again, this is up 80% relative to the same quarter last year. As many of you will realize, that's the equivalent of adding a mid-sized Permian pure play E&P company in a matter of months. In our operated Permian acreage, where we hold 100% of the working interest, we had an average of 20 rigs in operation during the quarter. We also had 21 non-operated rigs working on our acreage, which equates to approximately 7 net rigs, Chevron's share. As Jay discussed on the last earnings call, we remain focused on returns, capital efficiency and operational discipline. Within this framework our production levels are trending about one year ahead of the guidance we gave in March. I'll now pass it on to Pierre, who can give an update on our downstream and chemicals business. Pierre R. Breber: Thanks. Pat. We have a tightly integrated and profitable downstream and chemicals business. Slide 13 shows that Chevron's downstream has consistently led our peer group in earnings per barrel. And during the past five years our adjusted return on capital employed has averaged over 15%. Our fuels businesses are focused in the best markets in the U.S. and Asia. In petrochemicals, we are feedstock advantaged, heavily weighted to ethane. And we are the only major integrated with wholly owned lubricants and additives businesses. Looking forward, our objective is to grow earnings across our feedstock to customer value chains and target investments to lead the industry in returns. Now let me address IMO 2020. As a reminder, new International Maritime Organization regulations will reduce the sulfur emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2020. Although there are a lot of unknowns and uncertainties with how markets will react, most agree that complex refiners should benefit, as demand increases for marine gas oil. Slide 14 shows that Chevron's refining network has the highest complexity and the highest percentage of conversion capacity among its peer group. It is a result of high-grading our refinery portfolio over the years and investing in upgrading capability. Forward markets expect mid-distillate margins to increase post-IMO and high sulfur fuel oil and sour crude discounts to widen. Chevron's refining network produces over 40% mid-distillates and about 5% fuel oil. And as a complex refiner, we run a high proportion of heavy sour crudes. We believe we're well positioned to benefit from IMO impacts. We like the petrochemicals business and have highly competitive 50-50 joint ventures in ChevronPhillips Chemical Company and GS Caltex. Slide 15 shows our major chemical projects in various stages of development. CPChem successfully started up its Gulf Coast project after a remarkable recovery from Hurricane Harvey. The ethylene plant reached full production rates two weeks after a March start up and exceeded nameplate capacity soon after. CPChem is focused on additional de-bottlenecking opportunities. Following its success with this project, CPChem is in the evaluation stage of a second one in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We like the Gulf Coast because of its feedstock advantages and expect competitive ethane supply for a long time. We are focused on developing the most capital and cost efficient project, one that is on the left side of the supply stack. GSC is in front end engineering and design for a mixed feed olefins cracker, about two-thirds naphtha and the rest refinery LPGs and off-gases. We plan to make a final investment decision next year. Estimated costs are not final, but we expect our share of the capital to be a little more than $1 billion. The fundamentals of chemicals are strong, but costs always matter. We'll continue to be disciplined in how we invest in our next set of chemical projects. In our fuels businesses, retail is an important part of a tightly integrated value chain that starts with our complex refineries. Two recent retail highlights are shown on Slide 16. In Mexico, we have about 100 Chevron-branded marketer-owned sites. Customer response has been very positive. Stations rebranded during the first half of 2018 averaged 30% higher sales through September. We've also signed access agreements for two new terminals under development. After the terminals are complete, we will have built, in a capital-light way, an additional market to integrate with our West Coast value chain. We continue to grow our convenience store offering with now over 800 stores. As the only major with a leading C-store franchise in the U.S., we have an advantage in retaining and growing our relationships with retailers. Same-store sales at ExtraMile C-stores have grown 7.4% year-to-date, more than double the industry average. In the digital space, we made announcements on new mobile pay partnerships in the U.S. and went live with a pay app in Southeast Asia. These are important efforts to speed up and simplify the fuels retailing experience. In our Oronite additives business, we celebrated the groundbreaking for our blending and shipping project in China. This facility will help us serve the growing Chinese market when it's operational in 2021. Finally, in our lubricants business we are co-developing a renewable biodegradable base oil with ultra low viscosity and ultra low volatility, important properties for OEMs as they develop engines to meet increasingly stringent fuel efficiency and environmental regulations. It's early days, but we're excited by the potential of this new product. As shown earlier, Chevron's downstream and chemicals has a track record of consistent financial performance. That said, in any one quarter refinery planned turnarounds impact our results. Through our recent investor engagements, we've heard your requests for improved guidance in this area. Slide 17 shows the average after-tax quarterly earnings impact of planned turnaround activity for the last five years for our refineries in the U.S. and Asia. The impact is defined as shutdown expenses, plus the forgone margin from volumes not produced. Planned turnarounds are seasonal, but have a fair amount of variability in any given quarter. As a result, we believe that the best way to provide forward-looking guidance is by characterizing turnaround activity as high if the earnings impact is expected to be greater than $200 million; low if it's expected to be below $100 million; and medium in between. During 2018 the first two quarters had high turnaround activity and the third quarter was low. Now I'll turn it over to Pat to close out with fourth quarter guidance and year-to-date results. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. So now looking at Slide 18 just a couple of comments about expectations for the remainder of the year we expect positive production trends to continue in the fourth quarter fueled by sustained Permian growth and fewer planned upstream turnarounds. Downstream in contrast has a high turnaround activity planned and this is expected to weigh on this segment's fourth quarter earnings and cash flow. For C&E, you'll recall that we don't budget for unanticipated inorganic spend. Through the first nine months, we have spent approximately $150 million on inorganic C&E and we expect to spend a total of $600 million for the full-year, primarily as the result of six blocks won in the Brazil licensing round. Organic C&E is running modestly above our plan and we expect it to be approximately 5% higher than our full-year budget of $18.3 billion. Cash flow from operations is expected to be strong in the fourth quarter. Oil prices of course will be the primary determinant of this outcome and we can't predict those. While we do anticipate fewer affiliate dividends in the fourth quarter, we'll continue to benefit from further production growth, modest asset sale proceeds and some expected additional release of working capital. Lastly, let's revisit our year-to-date results and how they compare against commitments that we laid out earlier in the year. Cash flow from operations is expanding as anticipated given our strong production growth, favorable market conditions and asset reliability. Excluding the impact of asset sales, production growth is currently at 6% relative to full-year 2017 and we expect to end the year closer to a 7% year-on-year increase. Our Permian assets are performing well ahead of guidance. We continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio, with proceeds of $1.9 billion captured year-to-date. We're demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and are returning cash to our shareholders. Total shareholder distributions have amounted to $7.2 billion year-to-date, $6.4 billion in dividends and $750 million in share repurchases. We've had a very solid operating and financial performance so far in 2018 and we expect that performance to continue. We're seeing significant growth in cash generation due to the above plan production growth, continuing capital and operating expense discipline and favorable market conditions. As a result, we've been able to grow shareholder distributions and strengthen our balance sheet. We believe that Chevron offers a very attractive offering for investors with oil price levered momentum in the up cycle and low cost portfolio resilience in the down cycle. So that concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to get all your questions answered. Jonathan, please go ahead and open the line. Operator : Certainly. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Thank you very much. I guess first turn to the Permian. Obviously very strong operational performance there in 3Q. And while I certainly wouldn't prorate the growth that you saw there moving forward, I was hoping you might be able to address some of the factors that led to such strong production growth. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, Jason, thanks. I think, first of all we have been ramping up to the 20 rigs throughout the last couple of years and we achieved that 20 rig potential or realization here in the third quarter so that was the primary determinant. We are operating off of a new basis of design and we're finding that that has been incredibly successful. We're pursuing high density fracs and we're finding that that has been successful as well. So there's a number of factors that have led to the overall improvement that we have seen and I would say too, our NOJV partners, because prices have been stronger, perhaps than they were thinking at the beginning of the year, the NOJV activity has risen as well. Jason Gammel : That's great. And maybe to take advantage of Pierre being on the call. Pierre, we've had the discussion before about your downstream business being very high return and very high margin but relatively small compared to your competitors. I believe you've been quoted as saying that you may be interested in expanding your refining presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Can you, if that's correct, maybe talk about some of the strategic drivers for wanting to expand there? Pierre R. Breber: Thanks, Jason. Look, I won't comment on media reports or speculation but what I can say is I have for almost as long as I've been on the job now, over two years, talked about the strategic rationale of a Gulf Coast refinery, for three primary reasons. One, we're the only major company that operates one refinery in the Gulf Coast. Second is, we have a strong retail presence in Texas that we supply with third party barrels. And third is the possible integration and synergies with our advantaged position that Pat just talked about in the Permian. At the same time, I've also said we don't need to do anything. Pascagoula is a top quartile refinery. We have a tight value chain built around it. And I've also said we're value-oriented. Any acquisition has to be at the right price. Any investment that we do has to earn attractive returns. And so, I think that's all I can really say at this time. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Jason. Jason Gammel : Okay. Appreciate the comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Hey congrats, guys on a good quarter. Pat and Pierre, I want to get your thoughts on divestitures. You laid out a $5 billion to $10 billion target. You're about $2 billion of the way there, just how do you feel about the ability to achieve that? Where do you think you guys are going to fall in the range and just any updates on deal \u2013 on processes that might be outstanding. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I would say, overall, Neil, we feel positive about coming in within the range that we've indicated, the $5 billion to $10 billion over the three-year period of time. We're at $2 billion a little bit and change so far. There is a little bit more that will come in we believe in the fourth quarter. And then we have certain, I guess, I would say marketing activities that are underway already that should, we believe, realize results in 2019. So we feel comfortable about the $5 billion to $10 billion range. The assets \u2013 we're finding for those that are being marketed for example in the U.K. we're having reasonable interest. Actually, I'd say probably significant interest being shown by multiple potential buyers. So I think we feel very good about that range that we've given. Neil Mehta : That's great. And then when we talk to investors about \u2013 who are a little bit more skeptical of the bullish view on Chevron, they point to two things. I want you guys to address it head-on. And one is the concern that post-2020, capital spending might need to materially increase because you're in a period of harvest right now, but you might not have the projects to reload growth post-2020. The second source of concern is around production sharing contracts in Asia and the risk of them rolling off, particularly in Thailand, less so of a concern around Indonesia but anything you can say on both of those topics to help comfort the market would be helpful. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Well, let me just speak here to the issue around growth once we get into the early part of the next decade and investment opportunities therein. We obviously have a wonderful position in the Permian and with other unconventionals. And as you know, these are low capital intensity, short cycle high-return opportunities for continued volumetric growth. So that's number one. We've got TCO coming online with production in 2022. We have opportunities for de-bottlenecking on our LNG plants in Australia. We're just getting them to a fully run rate, high-reliability position now and we think the opportunity for reasonable de-bottlenecking is evident over the next several years. We have growth potential in deepwater. We have three potential areas in Gulf of Mexico; Ballymore, Whale and Anchor. And I think that's where people are thinking there will be substantial capital. And the reality is our objective is to pace those out over a several year period of time. And there's nothing in terms of the intensity on future investment there that would ever come close to the intensity that we've had in prior years which is where I think people's \u2013 they're thinking the history is going to color our future and that's really not the case. So I think we have growth potential, but it's going to be at a much lower capital rate. There may be some need to increase capital coming in say, 2021, 2022, that kind of range. But it will be small relative to where people might be thinking. Now I've taken so long on that; what was the other question that you had? Oh, the concession extension? Neil Mehta : Yeah. Concession. Yeah. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes. Okay. So I think it's \u2013 I'm really glad you asked the question because there's been a lot written on this and it's a good opportunity to try to work through the specifics. So if you look at our particular situation \u2013 and by the way, we put concession extension information, our expiration information in our stat supplement. So I really encourage people to look at those documents and get a good understanding of what is coming due when. But if you look out over the next three to four years, we've got about six contracts that will expire. We have one that is in a non-producing area, this is the Nsoko contract in Congo which expires in 2018 here. In Indonesia, we have the East Kalimantan PSC that expired just about 10 days ago or so. And the Makassar Strait PSC is going to expire in 2020. And we have a small NOJV PSC in China which is going to expire in 2022. So there are a couple of others that have more substance to us. All of those are relatively immaterial and not substantive. There are a couple that do have impacts for us and one would be the Rokan PSC in Indonesia and this has gotten a lot of press lately. We did bid on this, but we were not the successful bidder. The government of Indonesia elected to return this asset to Pertamina and this will expire in 2021. We're disappointed in that but we did put in a bid that we felt offered value to the government of Indonesia, as well as to the Chevron shareholder. Our net production in Indonesia today is about 100,000 barrels a day. But the earnings and cash contribution out of that is much smaller than that would indicate as a percentage of the upstream portfolio. And then the other contract of note, concession area is the Erawan PSC in Thailand and this expires in 2022. I can't say a great deal about this at this particular moment, but we have put in a bid that is under evaluation. We are taking the same approach that we did in Indonesia, which is to put in a bid that we feel offers value for Indonesia but also offers value for the Chevron shareholder. Neil Mehta : Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Philip M. Gresh: Thanks, good morning. First question, I guess... Wayne Borduin : Good morning. Philip M. Gresh: ...would just be a follow-up on the Permian, given your success that you're seeing there and that you hit your rig count targets for the end of the year. How are you thinking about the go-forward plans here? You talked previously about leveling off with the rig count at this point. But given the success you're seeing, does this make you want to kind of lean forward and add rigs in the Permian? Or how are you thinking about that today? Patricia E. Yarrington: So I think we feel good about having gotten to the 20 rigs. And our approach right now would be to take a bit of a pause and to really focus on capturing all the efficiencies that we can that a 20 rig fleet would necessitate basically. And that's from the land position to the drillings to the completions, all the way through to the market realization. So our approach right now is to take a pause, gain all that efficiency. We're really focused on the returns that we're getting from the investment that we're making. And we want to make sure that we're as capital efficient and as operating efficient as we can possibly be. And then we can always reappraise and look at our options and decide what we would like to do going forward. I will say that it's not so much about the actual rig \u2013 number of rigs that you have drilling, but it's the activity that's being generated and the results that you're getting and the cost per BOE that you're getting. And so I think over time we're going to try to move what we consider to be a critical performance metric away from just the rigs to something that would be more indicative of an efficiency measure. Philip M. Gresh: Yeah. Got it. That makes sense. Second question is just on the balance sheet metrics, 19% gross debt to cap, but 15% net debt to cap, so you're trending quite well on the balance sheet. How do you think about the desire to \u2013 given where we're at in the cycle, to continue to lower that metric versus other opportunities? You obviously started with the buyback last quarter of $3 billion. Is there any desire to potentially at some stage in the future increase that amount? Or given \u2013 do you have a more kind of conservative macro view, and you'd rather stick with where you're at? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I think \u2013 so it's a wonderful question and it's a great position to be in, Phil. We have only three months into the share repurchase program. We obviously feel very comfortable and good about the cash generation that is occurring in the company. And we also know that we've got a confirmed $18 billion to $20 billion capital program. So if we are in a position where we continue to see high cash generation, the market continues to give \u2013 to be at prices at current levels or approximately current levels, and we know our confirmed spending, then there's going to be surplus cash that is being generated. And if those circumstances all materialize, then we would obviously give consideration to the size of the share repurchase program. We will want the same kind of parameters that I outlined back in the last quarter to be evident. In other words, we want to make sure that whatever we do, we can have it be sustainable and that it's a reliable component available to our shareholders. I will say in that regard, the improvement to the balance sheet supports that sustainability. Because to the extent that we have a stronger balance sheet, then when we get into a downturn on price, and we believe that at some point in time that will come. When we get into that position, then we've got a balance sheet that can help support distributions to shareholders through the thin part of the cycle. Philip M. Gresh: Sure. Okay, thanks a lot. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, Pat, I'm afraid I'm probably the guy responsible for all these PSC questions, so I apologize. But I do want to follow up on the question from earlier if I may. Thailand is a legacy tax concession. And it's been re-bid as a PSC. The government has been quite transparent about the minimum terms. So I just wonder if you could address one issue. If you look at third-party analysis on this, meaning tax \u2013 very old tax framework information, this thing could be as much as $2 billion of your cash flow this year. Is that anywhere close to being right? And if so, under the new terms, how would you expect the delta on cash flow to look, even though that you might retain the contract from a production standpoint? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Doug, you're putting me in an uncomfortable position. I really can't comment while commercial discussions are underway and bids have been put forth and are being evaluated. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the outcome is from the discussions and the \u2013 whatever gets awarded. I think by the end of this year is sort of the planned date for understanding what the outcome will be. We'll have to give you an indication then of what the results will be. I can confirm that the bidding package does contain tougher fiscal terms. So I think you can build that into your expectations. But exactly what the degree will be, I'm not at liberty to say at this point. Doug Leggate : I certainly did not mean to put you in an awkward spot, but thanks for trying to answer it. My follow-up is hopefully a bit more constructive and it's on the Permian. So you're saying \u2013 in your prepared remarks you said you're running about a year ahead of schedule. So with the change in design and obviously the improvement we expect next year, at least in Permian spreads, differentials and so on, would you expect to basically maintain the same plateau target? Or given that you're running so far ahead, would you expect to see further upside risks to your production outlook? In other words, will you do more with less? Or maintain the same \u2013 or continue the same growth trajectory and take what it gives you with the same level of activity if you know what I mean? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I mean, I think we're really constructive on the Permian. And just some things to keep in mind, right. We've been ramping up to the 20 rig rate. We're now going to have 20 rigs for the full calendar year, once you go into 2019. So that will be a positive. We're seeing continued benefits coming from our new basis of design and continuing improvements in efficiencies as we move along. So we think that there's upside potential here as we continue to fine-tune our well placement; fine-tune really the entire I guess I would say value chain associated with the Permian. So, I think we're constructive on the Permian. And we'll certainly give you an update at our March in 2019 SAM, which we've done for several years now running. But I think it's a positive outlook that we feel for that asset. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Doug. Doug Leggate : Thanks for taking my questions, Pat. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Pierre \u2013 hi, Pat. Pierre, since you're especially on the line, I thought we'd go back to your IMO comments. There's been some recent press that the potential is for the market impact to be too severe for perhaps the administration to handle. I would imagine that would have to be on the gasoline price. Can you talk a little bit more \u2013 U.S. gasoline price for that matter, can you talk a little bit more about how you think the effect of IMO will play out? And to be specific, do you think there will be a major impact on U.S. gasoline prices as opposed to distillate? And one other thing I would ask is that, as regards fuel oil where do you expect the unused residual to end up and how will that clear the market given the transport difficulties there? Thanks. Pierre R. Breber: Okay. Thanks, Paul. Well, let's see. There are a lot of unknowns and uncertainties around how IMO is going to roll through the system. I think part of the challenge is that IMO is not in a vacuum, right. You can't hold everything else constant and think of IMO because it will be happening in 2020 when there will be other supply and demand factors happening. What's the economy doing at that point in time? What are sour crudes global production happening? So there are a lot of moving parts that are going on. But what you can step back and say and one of my comments sort of alluded to, if you look at the forward markets right now is you would see mid-distillates, diesel, gen diesel, crack spreads increasing post-2020. And you'll see HSFO or high-sulfur fuel oil and sour crudes discounts widening. And that makes sense, right? As you point out, there is a lot of fuel that goes to the bunker market. The expectation is that there's not enough scrubbers that have been put in place to consume all the high-sulfur fuel oil. So they are going to look to alternatives and those alternatives will be marine gas oil that will look like distillate. And/or it could be a low-sulfur fuel oil and there's a lot that's going on in that space. So in terms of MO gas, it's a difficult thing to predict, because there's so many factors. I think one thing I would say is that the underlying \u2013 we've seen crude move plus or minus $10 in a few weeks the last couple months. Those movements are much bigger movements on gasoline pricing or any product pricing. We're really talking just about differentials. And MO gas can really \u2013 you can see it going either way. It could get pulled up if some of the intermediates that are used for MO gas go to make distillates. You could also make arguments that it could weaken a little bit if runs are higher and there's excess MO gas. So it's really something that I can't predict. What we're focused on is being prepared for it, minimizing high-sulfur fuel oil production in our refineries by making small-scale modifications. We are seeing scrubber uptake increase for ship owners. We are looking to sell what we do produce to them. We're looking at alternative markets that are non-marine, like power generation, asphalt, folks, who have excess upgrading capability. And we're confident that we're prepared for IMO. We're also working on testing low-sulfur fuel oils, so different marine fuels, lubricants and additives and we're a leader in marine lubricants and additives. They are going to be a big part of the solution, so we're testing and developing new products for that. So there's a lot of work underway. We got a little more than a year to go and we'll be ready for it. Paul Sankey : Pierre, I feel like I'm not the first guy to have asked that question. Can you just give us any sense for the power generation market and your expectation of scrubbing penetration? Thanks. Pierre R. Breber: Well, again on scrubbing penetration, our view if you step back, the most economic way to comply with the IMO regulations is for ship owners to put in scrubbers, right. That's a much more cost-effective mechanism than investing capital. And we're not \u2013 or for refineries to invest capital. We're not looking to make any investments that \u2013 large-scale investments that are IMO-related. It's because we view it as transient. One thing about our markets is they work. And when arbs open up, they get closed. There's lots of players. There's lots of capital. And there are lots of people who are working to reduce arbs. So our view is that \u2013 sorry, I lost the track on that a bit. Patricia E. Yarrington: Power. Pierre R. Breber: Oh, on power generation, I'm sorry. Yes, on power generation there's a pretty good-sized market in the Middle East and other places. Again, it's not the \u2013 it's a lower-value market clearly. But our view is it's likely to require some power generation market to go through the transition. But again, over time, we expect scrubber uptake to increase and that will be the primary mechanism of complying with IMO. Paul Sankey : Pierre, thanks. I'll let someone else have a go. Thank you. Pierre R. Breber: Thanks, Paul. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Y. Cheng: Hey guys, good morning. Patricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng: Pierre, since you are here, so two questions for you; one really short. Your refining system, can you tell us what percentage you run as heavy oil, those we define as over \u2013 below 25 API? And how much is the medium sour you run, those we define between 25 to 30, 31 API? And the second question is that given your position that when you're looking to support your upstream, will you be involved or that think you need to be involved in terms of helping to ensure we have sufficient Gulf Coast oil export capacity because you may have some concern by late 2019 or early 2020 where you may have a gap. Or that you think that it's so transitionary that it's not really a concern and you guys don't need to be as an equity owner in those? And also then if you can comment on Duvernay, that it seems like we also have infrastructure issue. And that will \u2013 given your position and you're doing some pilot project and all that, is that something that you guys will involve? Or need to be involved I guess the question is. Pierre R. Breber: Okay. Let me see. Let me take the first one at least. We do not disclose specific sour content or API gravity. What we do disclose in our Annual Report Supplement is the region or country of origin of the crudes. And I think folks can figure it out from there. Again, I showed a chart that showed that we're the \u2013 have the highest Nelson Complexity, the highest amount of upgrading capacity. I mean, we are designed to run lower-value feedstocks and we've invested to make that happen but we don't disclose specifics on that. On your second question, on how we think about the upstream in the Permian, I guess, I would say the downstream is \u2013 has to stand on its own. Any investment we do has to stand on its own. We're competing as a segment. We're \u2013 I showed charts that showed how we are in earnings per barrel versus our major competitors. And so we have to look at that way. Now we're part of an enterprise; and if we can have synergies with the upstream, of course, that's an added benefit. But investments in the downstream can't ride on the back of, in particular, very attractive economics in the Permian. Again, we have to have investments that stand on their own merit that compete against our competitors. Any extra benefit from synergies is upside on that. On the third question, I think it was around takeaway and I'll leave that with Pat. Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, I was just going to add, I think you had a question about export capacity. And I think our corporate view would be yes, there may be a little bit of a need to build out export capacity over the next two or three years. But kind of going back to the belief that markets see this opportunity and that that capacity will be in fact built out, we don't see it as a risk to flow assurance. We have ourselves dedicated export capacity of about 25,000 barrels a day now. We see that expanding in the early part of next year to about 80,000 barrels a day. So far we've exported about 8 million barrels, I believe is the number. So we feel that we're investing appropriately for our flow. But we don't think in general over time that there will be a risk to flow assurance in the Permian because of export capacity. Paul Y. Cheng: Pat, is that the same apply to in the Duvernay area in Canada, that you don't believe that you need to involve on the build-out of the infrastructure there? Patricia E. Yarrington: In Canada? Wayne Borduin : Your question is in reference to the oil sands, Paul? Paul Y. Cheng: No, to the Duvernay? Wayne Borduin : Oh, Duvernay. Patricia E. Yarrington: Duvernay? Yeah, I guess I don't have any particular insights associated with Duvernay. Wayne Borduin : Yeah, I think I would just chime in. Pat, I think we have previously disclosed that we... Patricia E. Yarrington: (00:49:07). Wayne Borduin : ...a while ago we committed to the Pembina infrastructure agreement that is well-paired to enable our production out of the Duvernay. And you'd expect that as we continue to progress that development there that we would be able to step into additional capacity agreements to enable that flow. Paul Y. Cheng: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons & Company. Your question please. Blake Fernandez : Hi, folks. Good morning. Pat, a question for you on CapEx, it looks like you're trending about 5% above. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers are there, whether it's activity or inflationary based? And should we be thinking about that kind of giving upward momentum into the next couple of years as well? So maybe like toward the upper end of your range? Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. So, good question, Blake. Yeah, we're about $600 million on a year-to-date basis. We're about $600 million above plan if plan were ratable there. And about $150 million of this or so relates to inorganic, lease acquisitions, bonus lease payments that we have made. And as I said in my prepared remarks we expect that number to go to about $600 million by the time we get to the full year. But back to the nine months, that means we're about $450 million over on an organic basis, and there's really several reasons for this. It's not concentrated in any one particular area. The first thing I would call out is, just the fact that oil prices have been noticeably higher in 2018 than the planning premise that we use when we put the budget together. So there has been some cost savings. There were cost savings that we had built into our plan that we thought we would be able to capture from a capital standpoint. And we really haven't been able to capture those. Because the cost trends stopped going down; and in fact they leveled out, and in fact have turned the other direction along with oil price. So there's a piece of the overrun that relates to that. There is a piece that relates to major capital projects. Jay mentioned TCO on the last call, but there's other projects as well that I could throw in there with small overruns. And then, there's also more that's being spent in the Permian and again, we've talked about the drilling efficiencies, a new basis of design, the fact that we're able to prosecute the development plan against more acreage than we had originally envisioned. And with the high density fracs, they cost more, but in fact, the economic outcomes are really outstanding. And so the dollar per barrel per EUR is much better. So that's money \u2013 that's good money being spent. So those are the reasons that I would outline for the overrun that we have so far. In terms of pressures, inflationary pressures, I will say, we are continuing to see inflationary pressures, for example, in the Permian. And we do expect increases there, maybe in the order of 5% to 10% in the 2019 period. In general, because oil prices have been sustained higher, I think that the cost structure in the industry has moved up some. So I would say, yes, we are facing that and that would be something that would be reasonable to build into your expectations. Blake Fernandez : That is helpful. Thank you very much. The second question, I hope you didn't necessarily kind of cover this in exact detail on Paul's question, but mine was on the Permian takeaway. I think in last quarter's call you had kind of highlighted excess capacity through June and then ample takeaway for non-operated production through 2019. I'm just curious with the massive ramp-up that we're seeing here, are you still pretty well taken care of from a takeaway capacity through that same timeframe and say throughout next year? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yes, we are. Absolutely. I mean the whole process that we have, whether it be for crude or NGL transportation or fractionation, the whole setup that we've got is trying to stay ahead of what we expect the Permian growth to be. And so we do this through securing from \u2013 in increment, contractual offtake. So we feel very nicely covered for our position out of the Midland on those elements for the next couple of years. And of course, the team that we have working this will be working for the three year period and the four year period. I mean, it's a perpetual step-up that we are trying to orchestrate here. Blake Fernandez : That's great. Thank you. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please. Alastair R. Syme: Hi. Pat, can I just ask what makes Tigris different to Ballymore, Whale, and Anchor? Patricia E. Yarrington: I think it really comes down to the \u2013 it fundamentally comes down to the economics that we anticipate out of those individual developments. So you're influenced by the size of the resource, the demands as to whether that needs to be an independent topsides or whether it's got tieback opportunity, the complexity of the reservoir. I mean, there's a whole number of factors that go into account. And Tigris had its own complexity, because it was a three-field aggregated development. So you shouldn't read in to the fact that we decided to exit the Tigris leases, you shouldn't read in anything there about our dedication to the deepwater. We are still dedicated to the deepwater. We think we have expertise in the deepwater. We picked up a significant number of leases in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater as well as offshore Mexico and Brazil as well. So we're still invested in the deepwater. And we're just looking for the highest return projects. It's all about making choices and going after what we believe will be the best opportunity to secure high returns in our portfolio. Alastair R. Syme: Thank you. Can I \u2013 as a follow-up, can I just return to the discussion around PSCs and just clarify for the sake of the guidance that you put in the SAM around cash returns out to 2020. What sort of assumptions are made around contract renewal? Patricia E. Yarrington: Right. I mean, on the two important ones that I talked about for both Rokan and Erawan, both of the assumptions in the materials that we provided back in March were that those concessions were extended. In terms of the concession extension dates though, I think that's important. Both of those are 2021, 2022. So for the next several years we still have those available to us. Alastair R. Syme: Thanks for the clarification. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay. And I'd just say, and we can still, because we've seen such strong growth in the unconventional, even without those concession extensions, our \u2013 we can still see growth in our base plus shale and tight. Alastair R. Syme: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Roger D. Read: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess could we follow up a little bit your comments on the cost inflation on the CapEx side, specifically any update on TCO relative to where we were? And then, how these cost inflation issues or CapEx overruns affect the overall spending budget or run the risk of? And then as you're starting to think about where projects are going to bid out for 2019, is that already being incorporated in expectations? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, Roger, thanks for the question. First, let me let me just reiterate, staying within the $18 billion to $20 billion range is our focus here. And that comes with any sort of adjustment that needs to be made, whether it's on the major capital project side or it's on the inflationary side. We're making choices. And our choice is to stay within that $18 billion to $20 billion range. And we think it's very doable, because we've got lined out activity over the next couple of years. To TCO in particular, let me just make a few comments about that, because I did happen to visit the plant about 10 days or so ago with both Wayne and Jay Johnson. And so I do have a firsthand view of what's going on there. And just making a couple of personal observations here, got to start with the fact though, that we're only 2.5 years in and we still got 3.5 years to go. First oil is still scheduled for 2022. So we're only about 50% of the way through on all this. And I would say from my observation, a number of things are going quite well in the project. It's a big complex project. It's been broken down into individual, five individual work streams and those individual work streams have gotten lined out, kind of what I'll call productivity packages, work packages, where daily/weekly/monthly they've got identified activity that's being done and they're tracking their progress daily. And so we are seeing site productivity improve tremendously. I think Jay mentioned on the second quarter call, that 2019 \u2013 the rest of 2018 and 2019 are the really critical execution years. We're moving away from being out of the civils and undergrounds into the MEI phase. And so, 2019 will be an absolutely critical year from an execution standpoint. So I'm really \u2013 I was really impressed with the productivity gains that we're seeing. And of course, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. I don't want to get too far out over my skis or overstate anything here, but things are working well. The logistics are working well, the modules are being delivered. It's being lined out and proceeding quite nicely. Roger D. Read: That's fair. I think given the performance of the quarter we won't try to put you on the rack or stretch you right here. Patricia E. Yarrington: (00:59:31). I appreciate that. Roger D. Read: The follow-up question, as we think about the outperformance in the Permian this quarter, and I mean, it's been building for a while, just really spiked up here. Between the operated and the non-operated and thinking about your comments on the high density fracs and so forth, is \u2013 should we think about the outperformance being overwhelmingly within Chevron operated rigs, or spread out? In other words, you're \u2013 what you're learning in your own wells is being applied even to the non-op. I'm just \u2013 as we think about a change in rig percentages operated versus non-operated, whether or not that would affect growth going forward? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. So I would say in the quarter, the contribution in terms of absolute production between operated and non-operated was about the same. We had been building up activity, rig activity, as well as the non-ops had too. But of course, the non-ops had kind of rig activity that had started \u2013 production activity that started several years previously. So I feel, as though the contributions in the quarter are relatively comparable between non-op and co-op. Both areas are seeing improvement. Roger D. Read: All right. Great. Thank you. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Sam Margolin : Good morning. I'm sorry, it's late stage in the call. I sort of have a thematic question, but I'll try to keep it concise. You made a reference to fiscal terms kind of tightening or escalating in Thailand. That might be happening in other places too and at the same time, even with cost inflation in the Permian accounted for, sort of effectively the opposite is happening, where you're getting more efficient and economics are improving. So I guess, my question is just broadly, how do you manage that? In the past you've kind of set a level of where you think unconventional production could be within your portfolio, but if the economics on a relative basis are getting so much better than they are everywhere else, what's the process of kind of managing your mix here to make sure that you're optimized when things on the screen seem to incent you to go wildly in one direction? Patricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, yeah. Sam, I would just say, we have a fundamental belief in the value of diversification and having a diversified portfolio. And we have several legacy assets whether you think of Australia or unconventional in the Permian, TCO, deepwater. We have several significant asset classes that we want to continue to pursue. And you're right, in some locations around the world, you see a tightening of fiscal terms, but in other locations around the world you see the fact that the host governments are realizing that in order to incent foreign investment they need to revise the fiscal terms in a more kind of favorable to the investor, like a Chevron would be situation. So it ebbs and flows and we're in the business for the long term. And so we just \u2013 we continue to assess our portfolio and try to make the best decisions we can make not only for a short term, but also for long term; production growth, reserve replacement, cash flow growth, dividend growth, et cetera. So it's a \u2013 we look at it as a portfolio. Sam Margolin : All right. Thanks so much for all the color on a long call. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thank you. Pierre R. Breber: Thank you. Patricia E. Yarrington: Okay, I guess that was our last call. So I want to thank everybody for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everyone's participation on the call. Have a good day. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead. Mike Wirth : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements, please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Back in March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment. I outlined our three compelling strengths, an advantage portfolio, sustainability at lower prices, and a strong balance sheet. I also indicated that the combination of these distinct advantages together with the commitments to action highlighted in blue will deliver growing free cash flow and shareholder returns. In 2018, we delivered. We grew oil and gas production by more than 7% achieving our highest ever annual production. We grew cash margins in our operated upstream assets, contributing to an improvement in cash returns. We lowered our unit costs and we sold $2 billion of assets. These outcomes yielded record free cash flow, a dividend increase and the initiation of the share repurchase program. 2018 was a very successful year and we intend to build on this momentum in 2019. Turning to Slide 4, a view of our sources and uses of cash. Excluding working capital, we generated over $31 billion in cash flow from operations when we achieved record free cash flow of nearly $17 billion, the highest level ever achieved by Chevron in any price environment. This allowed us to deliver on all pore of our financial priorities. For the 31st consecutive year, we maintained our commitment to dividend growth and paid out 8.5 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders. Earlier this week, we announced a $0.07 per share increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, representing a 6% increase. Second, we allocated capital across a diverse portfolio and funded our highest return projects. We have confident these investments position us for sustainable growth and free cash flow. Third, we strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by 4.5 billion. Finally, we began repurchasing shares in the third quarter and increased the rate in the fourth quarter, demonstrating further confidence in our future cash generation. With that I'll, turn the call over to Pat who will take you through the financial results. Pat? Pat Yarrington : Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.7 billion or $1.95 per diluted share. 2018 full year earnings were $14.8 billion or $7.74 per diluted share, up more than 60% from 2017. In the quarter, foreign exchange gains of 268 million were offset by a special item related to the project write off. The detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. For the full year earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange totaled 15.5 billion. Return on capital employed for 2018 was 8.2%, up from 5% in 2017. Our debt ratio at yearend was 18% and our net debt ratio was approximately 14%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends, brining the full year total to 8.5 billion; and we increased the rate of our share repurchases from 750 million in the third quarter to 1 billion in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 6. For the full year, cash flow from operations totaled 30.6 billion about 50% higher than 2017. Headwinds as we defined them in the past, total 2.2 billion for the year in line with my original guidance. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was 9.2 billion. It was lower than in the third quarter primarily because of lower commodity prices, but it was above first quarter when prices were comparable. This improvement was in the year was due to growth in production. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4 billion and 13.8 billion for the year. And resulting free cash flow of almost $17 billion reduced our dividend breakeven price. We are covering our cash CapEx and dividend at just under $53 Brent, without consideration of asset sale proceeds. Before moving off cash flow a little guidance for 2019. As prices hold at current levels, we expect headwinds for 2019 to be between $2 billion and $3 billion. Now onto Slide 7. Full year 2018 earnings of 14.8 billion were approximately 5.6 billion higher than 2017. Special items, primarily the absence of U.S. tax reform gain of 2 billion lower gains on asset sales and an increase in charges relating to project write off resulted in a net 3.9 billion decrease in earnings. Our previous foreign exchange impact benefited earnings between the periods by 1.1 billion. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by about 9.3 billion between periods primarily because of higher realization and increased lifting, slightly offsetting where higher operating expenses largely associated with continued ramp up production along with additional taxes and other costs. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by just over 90 million, lower volumes reflected sales of our Canadian and South African refining and marketing assets while higher operating expenses were associated with planned turnaround activity in the U.S. These earnings were mostly offset by favorable timing effects and improved results at CPChem. In the other segment excluding special items and foreign exchange, net charges for the period increased by almost 750 million, due primarily to higher interest expense and lower tax deductibility for corporate charges. Full year net charges $2.3 billion in line with our guidance. Our 2019 guidance for the other segment remains about $2.4 billion in net charges. As a reminder though, quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable. Now on Slide 8. 2018 production was 2.93 million barrels a day, an increase of 202,000 barrels a day or more than 7% from 2017. This is the highest level of production in the Company's history. Excluding the impact of 2018 assets sales, production grew approximately 8% or 1% above the top of the guidance range we provided last January. Major capital projects increased production by 227,000 barrels a day as we continue to ramp up production at multiple projects most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased 132,000 barrels a day, primarily in the Permian where production grew by more than 70% from 2017. Base declines net of production from new wells, mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 19,000 barrels a day. The impact of asset sales in particular from the U.S. mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Elk Hills field in California reduced production by 50,000 barrels per day. Entitlement effects in total reduced production by 46,000 barrels a day, 17,000 of which was due to the effect of higher prices during the year. Higher plan turnaround effects primarily at Angola LNG and Tengiz, reduced production between years by 26,000 barrels per day. I'll now hand it back to Mike. Mike Wirth : Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement continues to be a real success story. In 2018, our reserve replacement ratio was 136%. We added almost 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. This outcome is especially significant because it was achieved while growing production more than 7%. Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.3 years, showing the strength and sustainability of our portfolio. Our five year reserve replacement ratio of 117% further illustrates as strength through the price downturn. Moving to Slide 10. We continue to maintain our commitment to capital discipline. Total C&E in 2018 was 20.1 billion. This included approximately 600 million of inorganic expense for which we don't budget, primarily related to bonus payments for offshore leases in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget for 2019 of $20 billion. Within this budget, the cash component is 13.7 billion while the remaining 6.3 billion is expenditures by affiliates, primarily TCO and CPChem. In our 2019 budget, 3.6 billion is allocated to the Permian and another 1.6 billion is allocated to other shale and tight assets. We expect approximately 70% of our total 2019 spends to deliver cash within two years. Our current spend profile has significantly lower execution risk relative to the past, and we have several large scale major capital projects underway concurrently. Turning to Slide 11. I would like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. During 2018, we received before tax asset sale proceeds of $2 billion, with the largest contributors being the divestment of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business and our interest in the Elk Hills field in California. We recently completed the sale of our interest in the Rosebank project West of Shetlands in the UK. In addition, we expect to close the sale of our interest in the Danish underground consortium in the first half of 2019, and earlier this week, we executed an agreement to sell our interest in the project deal in Brazil. We continue marketing our UK central North Sea and Azerbaijan assets. And with all the investments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we made last year is consistent with our guidance of $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds from 2018 to 2020. Turning to the Permian. Production in the fourth quarter was 377,000 barrels per day, up 172,000 barrels per day or 84% relative to the same quarter last year. Annual production was up more than 70%. In the Permian, we remained focused on returns. We are not chasing a production target, nor are we altering our plans based on the price of the day. Over the last two years, we transacted more than 150,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm outs and sales, further optimizing our large land position. In 2018, we had Takeaway capacity for oil and liquids that was more than sufficient, and we've already added more capacity this year. We're pleased with our position and leading performance in the Permian. In just two years, we've doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs and more than doubled our production. We will provide new guidance for our Permian portfolio in March. Moving to LNG, the plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone performed well during the fourth quarter and average almost 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was despite higher summer temperatures in December. Higher temperatures as you know generally reduce LNG throughput. We loaded 329 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone last year. We have now commissioned that Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect to provide gas to the local market in the next few weeks. We will begin our routine cycle of planned turnarounds at Gorgon this year. We will be on a four-year cycle with one frame undergoing maintenance each of the first three years and the fourth year having no turnarounds scheduled. We expect turnarounds at the Gorgon fence to last about 40 days. These turnarounds offer the opportunities perform routine maintenance and also to make small enhancements that increase reliability and throughput. We anticipate significant cash generation from these assets for many years to come. Slide 14 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Our growth is largely driven by shale and tight assets and full year production from Train 2 at Wheatstone. These forecasts always need to acknowledge the uncertainties in our business as noted on the slide. In summary, we anticipate a third consecutive year of strong production growth. Moving to Slide 15, as announced earlier this week, we signed an agreement with Petrobras America Inc. to purchase its 110,000 barrel per day refinery and related assets in Pasadena, Texas. This addition to our Gulf Coast refining system allows us to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of our retail market in Texas and Louisiana with Chevron produced products, and realize regional synergies through coordination with the refinery in Pascagoula. We expect to close by midyear and will provide further updates in our analyst meeting in March. Now just a few comments about future expectations. We expect positive production trends to continue in the first quarter and throughout 2019, reflected in the 4% to 7% growth forecast. As early as first quarter, we expect additional co-lending to TCO in support of the future growth project. In downstream, we expect low refinery turnaround activity in the first quarter which as you recall from our previous disclosures equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of less than $100 million. Earlier in the call, Pat provided you guidance on cash flow headwinds and corporate charges for 2019. And as we communicated earlier this week, there will be a $0.07 per share quarterly dividend increase and we anticipate $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter. Moving to Slide 17 I would like to share a few closing thoughts. As I mentioned before, we intend to win in any abundance. As a result of our advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, lower execution risk, strong balance sheet and record level free cash flow, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary, and will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : First question, you talked about the dividend breakeven a $53 in 2018, you stepped up a dividend here at a higher rate than last year, and you\u2019re also stepping up the buyback. So I guess may if you could just elaborate a little bit on this breakeven where you see that going? Is it moving lower and giving you more confidence than the more return on capital? Or just how you think about that capital? Mike Wirth : Well, Phil, we worked really hard over the last few years to get that breakdown. We were in the 80s not that long ago and have made significant progress in bringing the dividend breakeven down. We have provided I think a simple way to think about it in some of our prior definitions, and as we look forward in 2019, we think the dividend breakeven remains in the area where it was last year. You see we've got really strong cash flows coming in right now, and the commitment to a competitive increase in the dividends the confidence to step up through right a share repurchases is evidence of our confidence that we've got those cash flows coming in, in a price environments, any reasonable price environment as Pat has said, that we will be able to sustain those kinds of payouts. The other thing I would just point out is, our capital spending is still the same. And we have got the ability to provide strong production growth, sustain the kind of cash margins that you have seen out of our portfolio and do that at really modest capital spending relative to our history. Phil Gresh : The second question I guess would just be on that capital spending budget specifically for 2019. The Permian piece pretty flattish year-over-year which I think you've highlighted last quarter. The non-Permian shale piece just got the up quite a bit here. And I just wanted to know if you could maybe elaborate on that a little, not just stealing the thunder from the analyst day but. Is that something that is going to be contributing to this 2019 production growth guidance? Or is that something that you're ramping in '19, it would be more of a future contribution? Mike Wirth : Well, we are beginning to ramp in the other basins. So, we've added rigs actually in all the other shale and tight basins in which we operate. We've seen significant reductions in development costs in the Marcellus, in the Duvernay and in Vaca Muerta as we have shared the learnings and improvements that are emanating from the large scale activity we have in the Permian. The economics on each of these are compelling. The EURs are coming up. And while the Permian maybe in the spotlight within our shale and tight portfolio, it's far from the only asset that we have. The other thing that I just note is, we have begun an eight well appraisal program in El Trapial in the north of the Vaca Muerta. We are currently producing in the Sothern area Lana Compa\u00f1\u00eda, but our folks are intrigued by the possibilities up in the north at El Trapial, and we continue to prosecute that program. We have also picked up additional acreage in the Narambuena, a 25,000 net acres where non-operated with YPS, and we got a full well pilot that we plan to execute there in 2019 as well. So great potential in Argentina and we really like our entire shale and tight portfolio; and again, it brings some of the characteristics we have been talking about, which is short cycle time, attractive economics, low development costs and the ability to generate cash relatively rapidly. The last thing I'll say about that is it brings a much lower risk profile than multiyear multibillion-dollar capital projects. Phil Gresh : And Pat, what was the amount of the co-lend for TCO? Pat Yarrington : In 2018 the co-lend was zero. Phil Gresh : For the 1Q guide, I\u2019m sorry. Pat Yarrington : Oh, the 1Q guide, okay. So, I don\u2019t have like I would say, a confirm number here for you because it will depend on what happens to price. It will depend on what happened and how the cash flow that\u2019s generated from operations matches against the investment profile for the project. It will also depend on the dividend distribution requirements for the partnership. But I think order of magnitude, if you go back and you look at 2016 when we first started the co lending that was about $2 billion, and I think as order of magnitude starting off base, maybe think about $2 billion for this year. But as I say, we reserve the right to change that number as the year progresses and we see what actually happens to prices and the investment profile and as discussions are under way on dividend. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Chain from Barclays. Your question please. Paul Chain : Mike, you talk about Argentina. I'm wondering, given the political environment, the infrastructure or lack of infrastructure over there, how quickly you think you can proceed with the development plan? And any kind of timeline or the pace or the capital outlook, any kind of data that you can share? Mike Wirth : We will probably talk about this little bit more in March Paul. But I'd just reiterate, YPF has been a very, very good partner there. There Macri government is committed to improving the investment climate in Argentina and has instituted a number of reforms to encourage and support energy development in the country. We have great resource there that\u2019s benefiting from the Permian learning and competitive economics, multiple blocks that we picked up, and much of production can actually stay in the country. So at this point, yes, the infrastructure is not developed the way that it is in United States or perhaps North America more broadly, but there's a commitment on the part of the government to do that. And we'll pace our developments with the gas and liquids take away and market conditions. So, the realities on the ground in Argentina are a little bit different, but I got to see the resources tremendous, and we\u2019re very encouraged by the policy reforms that have been put forth by the government. Paul Chain : And for Pasadena, the refinery that you just bought, what's the game plan for that facility? I mean, are you going to need to make a significant investment up front to bring them to the Chevron standard? Because that facility probably has been underinvested at least for 20, if not 30-plus years and the labor relationship has been always very rocky. So what's the game plan? And how much is the upfront investment? And secondly, are you going to run it as a full-blown facility or that is sort of by an extension of Pascagoula? Mike Wirth : So, let me try to respond to that Paul as best I can. We just executed an agreement this week. We don\u2019t expect to close here until somewhat later here in the first half of the year. So, it's a little premature for me to lay out an investment plan fully actually closed the transaction. In the due diligence, we have satisfied ourselves that we can operate the facility safely and reliably at the standards that we would expect. And so, I don\u2019t think you should have any concerns there. It meets our three primary criteria. One, we are getting it at a good price, and I believe one of the ways that you take risk out of the final acquisitions as you should don't overpay, and I don't think that we are over paying for the asset. It's in a great location and that allows us to integrate to increasing like crude production. Out of West Texas that allows us to serve our markets in Texas with product that we run through our own system as opposed to exchange or purchase product, and it will allow us to optimize and integrate with the Pascagoula refinery. The third thing is, it provides good strong economics and because of our system in the three kind of strategic levers that I just talked about we ought to be able to optimize that refinery as a part of our system in a way that is different than what the current owner can simply because they don't have those other assets and those other positions. And so within our business, this fills a bit of a gap, it gives us the ability to capture value in multiple different dimensions. And overtime, we will evaluate what investments we may choose to make there as we would in the other refinery. I would expect those to be relatively modest. I would expect them to be thoughtfully paced overtime and fit within the level of spending that we've established over the past many years in our downstream business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : The first question I had with around Tengiz. In the latest on the project are you feeling good about the timeline and thoughts on cost and the contingency as well? Mike Wirth : So I probably don\u2019t have a lot to add to what we have previously said on this. We are still on schedule, so we are still targeting a 2022 startup. As I think Jay mentioned on our third quarter call, on site productivity has improved. We had a very good summer. The logistics are working very well as we are moving modules now from Korea to the staging points. We can't move through the inland waterway system during the wintertime because it freezes up, but modules arriving from Korea from Italy and from Kazakhstan. The quality levels are very high. We are about halfway through the project about 50% complete at this point. And in 2019, it will be a key year. There's a lot of activity in terms of moving modules into the Caspian to the site a lot of fieldwork where we will see if these productivity gains can be built upon again in 2019 and it\u2019s certainly a year where we will reduce uncertainty. Jay is actually headed there this weekend and will be there in next week. And when we get to New York in March, he will have had recent field visits to Kazakhstan and also to Korea. He was in Korea visiting the module fabrication yards last week and he will be in a position to give you very good insight into exactly where we stand and what our expectations are. Neil Mehta : Yes, looking forward to that. And the follow-up: we just want to get some more color on the share buyback. To follow up on Phil's question, I think most of us were expecting $750 million. It came in at $1 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the share buyback program, our view had been that this program would be kind of a base load $3 billion program into perpetuity, but you are demonstrating that you are willing to flex and lean into it. Can you talk about the philosophy behind that share repurchase program? Is a higher run rate potentially sustainable? And how you think about flexing it from a big picture and then a more granular perspective? Mike Wirth : Yes, I\u2019m going to let Pat take it. Pat Yarrington : I think the keyword here is suitability and what you saw with our increase was just, our view of future cash generation, the confidence that we have in our future cash generation and the belief that we could move that rate of quarterly purchase up to $4 billion. When we first initiated this back in the second quarter call, the points that I made were that we really wanted to have this be through the cycle and sustainable through the cycle. And so that\u2019s really we paid the $3 billion because we thought that would be supportable to any reasonable price environment. We obviously had stronger prices in 2018 and not that come off a little bit, but we still feel very strong about our cash generation in 2019 and frankly in the years to come. You will note, maybe you won\u2019t note, but we did release an 8K this morning as well that talked to the fact that our board has supported a resolution for a $25 billion with share repurchase program with no term limit. So I think that $25 billion gives you can indication of that commitment, that we have to this program our view about the sustainability. Yes, I think that should be very strong message to our investor about our willingness and intent to boost shareholders distribution. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : I wanted to ask a question about the cost structure of the Company. And the reason I ask is you have already taken a lot of cost out of the upstream, but you seem to be with divestitures and some explorations concentrating more and more into the highest-quality assets. I am just wondering if there is the potential to take further overhead out of the business through medium-term shutting down regional offices, etc. This seems to be right out of the Mike Wirth downstream playbook of taking further cost out and enhancing returns through concentration. Mike Wirth : Jason, I will give you short answer and the answer is yes. I think in a commodity business you always have to looking for efficiencies, and I think scale matters and we need to continue to look for ways to control our own destiny. And a big part is moving into assets that have inherently lower cost structures in continuous seeking an efficient overhead structure to support that. I will tell you that, not only can you do that through what I would call conventional means in a ways there is always been done, but technology today offers us the ability to do even more as we bring digital technologies into our business and can do things in a business that really grew up in an analog world. There's a lot of opportunity to find more efficiencies. The other thing when you\u2019re growing your business, it's important to pay attention to unit cost and we've seen unit cost come down significantly. We see this year another 2% reduction or so in unit cost, and as you look out to 2020 and 2021, I think that number can go up even more in terms of the percent reduction or the other way to say as unit cost can come down even more. So, we need to be prepared to be competitive in an environment where prices are not what we look to and we will continue to work on cost efficiencies across our entire portfolio. Jason Gammel : Just a very quick follow-up, can you talk about the ramp-up progress at Big Foot? Mike Wirth : Yes, so, we have got the first well online and it's been performing very well. It came on in November of last year. The second well is being drilled and completed as we speak, and we anticipate that going on here in the first quarter. So we will steadily move through the process of adding wells at Bigfoot and you can expect that to be part of the production story in 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please. Paul Sankey : You mentioned that you've done about 150,000 acres of swaps or sales I believe in the Permian, Mike. And hi, Pat, by the way. Sorry, I was slightly caught off guard there. I wanted just an update on where your final numbers are for Permian acreage. And how you feel about that, given that there's potentially some fairly major assets available. I guess you are strongly outperforming your volume targets. Can you also talk about your returns there? Because there's concerns that you are perhaps not as leading-edge as we might want you to be in terms of your Permian performance on a returns basis. Mike Wirth : Yes, so, we will share lot more detail in March because as you can see, the performance out of the Permian continues to be exceptionally strong. With the large land position that we have, we have got good currency and optionality, we try to improve that because everybody is interested in drilling longer laterals finding contiguous development areas. And so, with our 2.2 million net acres and 1.7 million in the Midland of Delaware basins, we have got lots of levers with which to optimize our position and the nice thing about these transactions is they are truly win-win because you can transact with other people. There is enough economic value creation that you're not trying to split a finite pie, but you creating a bigger pie for both. Our currently disclosed resource, there is 1.2 billion barrels that\u2019s a figure that we would expect to grow. So our confidence in the Permian is higher today than it was the last time that I spoke to you. When you talk about returns, we put out data before on the returns that we are seeing and they are well locked in 35% plus range as we have moved to longer laterals of better basis of design and even in a modest price environment, we are seeing very, very strong returns. It's as good as or better than anything else we could be doing. We are returns-driven and I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and I'll reiterate that, and as returns across the lifecycle of the asset and as returns across the entire value chain. And so we are not looking to put the most wells online or have the biggest IPs, we are looking to get the best returns out of the system. We paused at 20 rigs for several years. We've been telling you we are going to grow to a 20 rig fleet. And as you go through that kind of growth, you stress the system little bit. And so, we're pausing in terms of adding rates at this point in order to ensure that anything that needs some proof from a thought performance standpoint will. We engage in regular benchmarking within the basin. We have a number of non operated joint ventures, we got really good visibility into what other operators are doing and what levels they are performing at. And I will simply tell you that we\u2019re continuing to improve performance in every dimension in intent to continue to and using benchmarking to identify the areas where we can get better. So, our Jay will talk a lot more about this in March. We will have a breakout session that will give you a chance to go into details with questions as well. But we feel like we are delivering better performance and across the value chain, I mentioned we been well situated with takeaway capacity and we\u2019ve added capacity already in 2019. So we\u2019re able to capture margin across the value chain and later this year that will include refining margin. Paul Sankey : Thanks Mike. And we know also that you have got an advantaged mineral right position there, which seems to be one of the issues with any potential major deals that might occur in the Permian in the near future. Mike, if I could ask you another one. I was going to make some elaborate joke about you keeping it competitive by not having just the CEO on the call but also the CFO. But obviously referring to Exxon's CEO being on the call this morning, there is a major number of major differentiations between the two companies and one of them is your flat CapEx outlook. I think that you would do well to maintain that. I think it is a relatively long-term outlook as it stands. You have just drifted towards the top of the range without going above it. What are the prospects of you actually seeing falling CapEx and CapEx that surprises to the downside going forward, given that your growth trajectory looks very good for a company of your size? Mike Wirth : Yes, so we were committed to capital discipline. We can grow our business at modest capital levels and we have more good things to invest and then we will invest in. Last year there are two notable examples. We relinquished our rights to the Tigris development project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, not because it's not a good project, not because it can\u2019t generate a return but we have better opportunities within our portfolio, same thing with Rosebank good projects, a lot of resource but one that probably fits better for someone else than it does for us given our alternatives to invest. And so, we will continue to make those kinds of choices. The one thing that came up in the call earlier were the other shale and tight opportunities, and those are really economic as well. And so, there are opportunities for us to whether you're talking in the Permian or some of these other areas overtime to find highly attractive opportunities to invest further capital generate strong returns, minimize execution risk, short cycle annual. And as our portfolio grows, we were up 5% in production, two years ago 7% last year we just outlined 4% to 7% this year growing portfolio overtime does require modestly higher based capital spending that would go with that. And so, we're committed to capital discipline and I think you've characterized our ability to grow it. So it's relatively flat capital well. We will update forward views beyond what we've already articulated when we get to the March meetings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons. Your question please. Blake Fernandez : Two questions for you. One: could you talk a little bit about Venezuela? I know it's early days, but obviously you do have exposure there, both upstream and downstream and just any helpful thoughts that might help us out on our end. Mike Wirth : Yes, I can give you quick update on Venezuela, Blake. First and most important thing for us is the safety of our people on the ground, and so that's what we are really focused on. We also want to be sure the operations where we have an interest are safe and environmentally sound. And I can tell you that that is the case. We have worked closely with the governments to be sure that we understand the intent of the sanctions within a number of new general licenses issued by the Treasury Department. And so, we are in close consultation to be sure we understand them and how they are to be applied. And I will say that the U.S. government has been very interested and engaging with us to understand our position on the ground. And we continue to operate and I think for the foreseeable future we feel like we can maintain a good stable operation and the safe operation on the ground in Venezuela. If you look at it from the downstream side in the U.S., Pascagoula is the one refinery of ours that tends to run Venezuelan crude and it runs 70,000, 75,000 barrels give or take. For some time, the prospects of actions like this have been clear and so we have had contingency plans in place. We have got alternate sourcing. We have got plenty of crude in tank for Pascagoula. We have got crude on the water there. And so, we are good here for the balance of the first quarter and maybe a little bit beyond and then back to visit our contingency planning into a full-scale execution right now. So, we will keep the refinery full with the crude. We will optimize and I think we feel like we are going to able to navigate through this. Our biggest hope is for stability on the ground in Venezuela and the safety of, not only our employees, but the contractors and the people in Venezuela. Blake Fernandez : The second question : I know you've kind of covered Pasadena and we will get some additional color in March. But just more broadly speaking, I think you have kind of alluded to a potential acquisition of a refinery on the Gulf Coast for some time. The size of this is 110,000 barrels a day or so, which isn't small, but it's not really large in context of some of the Gulf Coast facilities. Does this satisfy kind of your appetite or integration potential there? Or do you think there is additional scope to kind of expand that overtime? Mike Wirth : I don\u2019t want to speculate really we got one transaction here that we have signed an agreement on. The key is value and the ability for it to not only yield value on a standalone basis, but to integrate into our network and to be sure we can capture value out of them so we are focused on that with the Pasadena refinery. And I think I will leave it at that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : I know all the really fun stuff has got to wait to March, but maybe to take a look at your CapEx mix. You mentioned 70% has a 2-year or less weighting to cash flow, whereas the rest obviously longer. Do you think as we not so much look at a total CapEx number but the mix within that CapEx, does that start to change back over the next couple years? I'm thinking number one : you signed a long-term deepwater rig contract obviously aimed at some of the more challenging parts of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So as things like that start to come in, do we see that start to move maybe to more of a 50/50 on CapEx? Or is that something you want to maintain maybe more at the 70/30 level as we think over the next several years? Mike Wirth : Yes, Roger, it\u2019s a good question because our mix has shifted very dramatically from it was not long ago and its come down by 50% from the high watermark and that shifted in terms of makeup. I think both important issues and going back to Paul Sankey's question. I think that is the new normal for us. We got in this year budget a little bit over $5 million for shale and tight, 3.6 in the Permian, 1.6 on other shale and tight. And overtime, I think that number is likely to grow rather than on shrink. We get FGP which is in the peak spending years this year and next. And so, that's a non-trivial amount little bit over $4 billion in this year's budget. And so as that moves past the fleet and comes down, it creates room for other things and that could include deepwater, it could include more shale and tight or other major capital projects. On the under deepwater our incent was to have a ratable development program and I think one of the things that we have learned over this past cycle I mentioned, we have very large MCP underway simultaneously is that that introduces execution risk that is real. And so, our intent would be to have a balanced approach as we go forward and not to find ourselves. So overly skewed to that kind of risk that that it becomes an issue that's difficult to manage and because we've got the really strong shale and tight portfolio, I think that plus our base business which again is requires investment, but it's typically short cycle and trip to go from capital spent to cash in the door. I think the kind of range that we\u2019re today is more likely to plus or minus be the range you would see in the future as opposed to something that flips back the other direction. Roger Read : And then just to beat the Pasadena refining horse a little bit harder here, part of the acquisition indicated some undeveloped acreage. Are we wrong to think about this as just a refining acquisition and maybe should think about it more as an infrastructure opportunity across the board? I'm thinking we're moving more and more towards crude exports from the US. Mike Wirth : I think there is a reason we disclose that because the asset there is not simply the refinery, but it's the port access, it\u2019s the tankage and it's the land. And I mentioned a couple of times that, our goal is to integrate this into our system. That means our upstream system or downstream system our trading system, and when I was young pup one of the lessons I learned from Susan engineer in one of our refineries is, he said, the cheapest process we have in this refineries is call the tank. And so, there are times when we can fall in love with building complex equipment and there are realities that you can create optionality and margin through infrastructure and commercial activity at relatively lower investment. And I think this asset offers us on the opportunity to not just participate in the refining margin, but also to look at the other ways that through our integrated system we can capture value across the entire value chain both up and downstream and that's the way we are approaching this. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Sam Margolin : Mike, I'm going to try to not ask you to say the same thing again in a different way. But one of the outcomes of the much Permian growth is maybe that the free cash flow profile of the Permian as a standalone entity has been pulled forward significantly. And maybe that is sort of an obvious statement or it is not new. But it seems like that is an important pendulum swing with respect to how you might think about additional long-cycle projects. So among all these other factors that are sort of -- that you have commented on kind of pointing you to thinking about expanding the portfolio in deepwater or other long-cycle areas, is that something that's important, too? Or is that more something that is on plan and you are just thinking about that within the buyback and the dividend growth and all your other sort of uses of cash that are out there? Mike Wirth : So I think the increase performance of the Permian is a good new story. We did spend little more capital last year because we were finding that we can drill more hole we have changed our basis of designs, so little bit of capital overrun was related to the good news story that we are getting a lot more production out of the Permian. And our guidance has been we are free cash flow positive in 2020, and I think that\u2019s still a good way for you to think about it. As we have reached the crossover points it crosses over. And we have increased the dividend that Pat has already addressed the confidence in increasing the rate at which we are repurchasing shares and our intent to sustain that through the cycle. Having strong free cash flow creates alternatives and we intend to use the free cash flow to be very mindful of the need for shareholder distributions and also to look for good investment opportunities. I mentioned we were able to meet all four priorities this last year in terms of dividend investments balance sheet and share repurchases and our intent is to continue to respect that going forward. This kind of growth and free cash flow allows us to do that. Sam Margolin : Okay. And just on a related note; I guess this one is for Pat. Is there -- leverage came down a lot. Is there a target leverage to think about conceptually? Or is it just something that is going to be a function of commodity prices in terms of the rate at which the balance sheet fluctuates here? Pat Yarrington : Sam, we don\u2019t have a target leverage rate, we think of the balance sheet as being the outcome of other previously outstanding decisions about how we use the cash that we are generating. As I have said in the past, maybe a 20% leverage ratio on average through the cycles. And during the stronger price environment, you would obviously build back your balance sheet some and when you are in the weaker price environment you use it some. So, I think that\u2019s really what we are trying to -- that\u2019s kind of the sweet spot or the sweet area that we are trying to play in. Having a good balance sheet, it\u2019s a good insurance policy. And having a good balance sheet, allows us for both dividend and share repurchases to sustain those through any period of price weakness. And we feel that that\u2019s an important component. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please. Alastair Syme : It was really just one on your view on the state of the Gulf Coast chemical polyethylene market and how that makes you think about potential expansion plans. Thank you. Mike Wirth : We\u2019re still very positive on the petrochemical investments opportunity and particularly here in the states. I think it\u2019s a good long-term story. We've seen some pressure on margins here recently because feedstock costs in the third quarter were up. I think all in the chain margins have been under little bit of pressure, but these things happen in commodity markets with long cycle time for projects, and kinds of ebbs and flows in the economy. So, that hasn't fundamentally changed our view on the attractiveness of the sector. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : And Mike, we always appreciate you getting on these calls, so thanks again for doing it this time around. Mike, my question might actually be for Pat. Pat, you talked about the $13-billion-plus of cash spending. Can you give us an idea as the affiliate spending rolls off with Tengiz completed, how do you anticipate that cash CapEx to trend, given that you are holding the line on the $18 billion to $20 billion absolute spending at least through 2020? Pat Yarrington : I think Mike, answer that question in a way, although, we didn\u2019t split out cash verses total headline C&E. But as you see TCO's spending come off and as we move toward first production there in 2022, the other affiliate where we have potentially investment opportunities would be CPChem. And so that what occurs in that particular category will be a function of how decisions are made on investment [technical difficulty] for example. So it's not something that I can project with any degree of certainty. I think what\u2019s important is that the summation of both, what I would say company owned and operated an affiliate owned and operated, we\u2019re staying that $18 billion to $20 billion range for the near-term here certainly, and we will give you an update in March on prospectively longer period of time. But I think capital discipline is a theme that you want to read through all of this and the fact is that we have the opportunity to be very judicious and very selective about how we work in additional projects into our queue. Doug Leggate : I know it's a tough one to answer, given all the variables. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess. But if we go back to 2010, 2011, 2012, through 2014, 2015, obviously a lot of big oils, yourselves included, were spending much higher levels than you are today. And one assumes that that created a lot of cost recovery barrels in some of the PSCs. So I guess my question is to the extent you can, as we look forward in light of Thailand, how do you see your entitlement barrels trending if you maintain that CapEx at these levels? Do you start to see cost recovery barrels tail off? And if you can maybe offer some quantification of that, I would appreciate it. Pat Yarrington : Doug, I don\u2019t think we've got numbers here that we can isolate for you on that. Cost recovery applies across the number of locations in our portfolio here. You\u2019re obviously aware of what happened in Indonesia. So, I don\u2019t think I have a pinpointed answer that I can give you on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please. Doug Terreson : Mike, I have a question about portfolio optimization and specifically the divestiture part of the plan. And on this point, you guys have had a pretty active program over the years, but you still also have a decent amount of value left in the queue. So my question is, is this because the market for assets has softened somewhat? Or do you consider it to be kind of normal course of business during the cycle or is it something else? So any color on your divestiture program and the market trends you guys are experiencing is really the question. Mike Wirth : Yes, I'm not a 100% sure I'm tracking with you there, Doug. We have always had program of divestitures, and there were times it's a little high and times it\u2019s a little bit lower, but in this business you are continually looking to upgrade your portfolio. We have got some things now that are really attractive. And I earlier mentioned a couple of things that we stepped away from because we didn't think they would compete for capital. Divestments are driven by a view on strategic alignments with our broader portfolio and our view of the future, the resource potential that remains particular asset, will it compete for capital within our portfolio and there are good things as I mentioned earlier that cannot and then can we receive fair value. So that maybe a little bit of a function of what's the macro environment and the forward view on commodity price. But we are in a position that I think you can expect us to continue to high-grade our portfolio. Doug Terreson : Yes. So Mike, maybe I should have asked it differently. So it seems like you guys are experiencing healthy enough appetite for assets if you were a seller. Is that a good way to think about it? Mike Wirth : Yes, everything we are talking to people about right now we think we are likely to receive very good value. Operator : Our last question for today comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. Biraj Borkhataria : It was actually on the reserve replacement. In 2018, you had 136%; that was a pretty impressive figure, given the growth trajectory over the last few years. I was wondering if you could just disaggregate some of the impacts there, particularly on the price impact in terms of revisions from 2017 to 2018. And then what the key kind of moving parts where. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yes, so, we did have another strong year, and our largest ads came through our Permian shale and tight activity through other shale and tight, and some of these other basins we've been talking about our Gorgon and Wheatstone, so primarily in the unconventional but contributions across the board from Australia, Canada, Asia, Gulf of Mexico, Eurasia. Our price was relatively small negative revision less than 100 million barrels on price. We produced just short of 1.1 billion barrels we sold about 60 million barrels. So, there was not a big price impact in there and while unconventionals were the big piece, so we had contributions from others. The one thing that I would call your attention to is what we view as very high quality reserve addition. They are barrels that have bring with them lower risk that\u2019s lower execution risk and lower geologic risks and lower breakeven prices. And so, we would expect to continue to have a good strong reserve replacement story as we go forward given the quality of our portfolio and the continued improvements that we see particularly on conventional development activities. All right, well, that is the top of the hour. I want to thank everybody for your time today. I appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call, and I look forward to see many of not all of you in New York City in March. Thanks very much.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead. Mike Wirth : All right. Thank you, Jonathan and welcome back. We missed you. I'd like to welcome everybody to Chevron's first quarter earnings call and webcast. Our new CFO, Pierre Breber and our Head of Investor Relations Wayne Borduin are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2. Moving to slide 3, today, I'll make a few opening comments, Pierre will review first quarter results and then we'll take your questions.  As I've said before, we're well positioned to win in any environment. During our Security Analyst Meeting, we shared that our advantaged portfolio, strong balance sheet and low breakeven, capital discipline and lower execution risk position us well to deliver superior shareholder returns. With the announced acquisition of Anadarko, our story gets even better. It builds strength on strength. We submitted our anti-trust filing yesterday to begin regulatory approvals. And we've begun joint integration planning.  We know how to integrate two strong companies to create an even stronger one. We've done it well on prior transactions, and we'll do it again. We remain confident that the transaction agreed by Chevron and Anadarko will be completed.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre who will take you through the financial results. Pierre R. Breber: Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 4, our disciplined returns focused approach to the business continues to drive solid earnings and cash flow. First quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange losses, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.47 per share.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5.1 billion. Excluding working capital changes, it was $6.3 billion. We maintained a strong balance sheet with a debt ratio less than 20% at quarter end. During the first quarter we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, up 6%. Share repurchases during the quarter were around $500 million lower than our $1 billion per quarter guidance. During the quarter, we were restricted from buying back shares in light of the Anadarko acquisition.  Turning to slide 5, despite lower refining and chemical margins, cash flow was solid and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Working capital effects in the quarter consumed $1.2 billion, generally consistent with our seasonal pattern. Free cash flow, excluding working capital changes was over $3 billion. Other cash flow items included pension contributions of about $325 million asset sale proceeds of around $300 million and TCO co-lending of $350 million. Operator : Certainly  Our first question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Devin McDermott : Great, good morning. Mike Wirth : Good morning, Devin. Devin McDermott : So I wanted to start, so I'm sure it'll be asked if I don't, just on the Anadarko deal and the process there, appreciate the additional color in the prepared remarks. First, can you just walk through and remind is what the timeline is and key milestones and process from here, and any comments you can make on the competing off from RCU  would be helpful as well. I'll leave to you, is that how you like? Mike Wirth : Sure. So the timeline is, probably a little different today than I would have told you a couple of weeks ago because we now have Anadarko\u2019s Board back considering a unsolicited proposal. We made -- our anti-trust filing. I mentioned that, that went in yesterday. We don't see any material, anti-trust or anti-competitive issues that arise from the combination, and so we would expect that to be handled within a pretty reasonable period of time, say 60 days. Depends if they come back for a second review with any questions. And then we have an Anadarko shareholder vote, that will be scheduled and could result in a third quarter close. Devin McDermott : Understood. Makes sense. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Devin. Do you have a follow-up. Devin McDermott : Yeah, one follow up. I just wanted to shift over to TCO and the co-lending. You mentioned the guidance there is unchanged, but any color you can give us on the shaping and how we should think about that playing out throughout the year. Pierre R. Breber: Yeah, Devon, this is Pierre, I mean, you should view it as you know, roughly ratable and but again, it'll vary depending on prices and project spending and affiliate dividends. But if you think of it being roughly ratable during the course of the year that's appropriate at this point in time. Devin McDermott : Thank you very much. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Devin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. First question, in light of the competing bid that's put out there and the details behind that, I think one thing that surprised investors would be perhaps the degree of synergies that Occi talked about in their proposed transaction, even if you back out the capital reduction component. And so I think, you've been asked about the degree of conservatism already to some degree about your synergy forecast. But now that's out there, I was just wondering if maybe you'd have a comment about your numbers and where upside could come from. Mike Wirth : Sure, Phil, so look, I'm not going to comment on the details of another offer. I'll tell you our synergies are real and we're confident, our ability to achieve the $2 billion in run rate synergies in the first year post close, and delivering significant value from the deal.  As I mentioned earlier, we've already begun joint integration meetings with Anadarko. We had full teams from both companies meeting for multiple days this week already. We're committed to delivering the synergies. We've got a strong history of successfully integrating two companies and meeting and often exceeding our synergy targets, this can go back to Gulf , it can go to Texaco, it can go to Unical .  And so this is something we've done before and we're very good at it, we're very confident that we can, that we can deliver the $2 billion. And as we know what we know, at this point, and as we get more detail, we certainly will know more. Phil Gresh : Okay, fair enough. Just a follow-up question would be, obviously there's more to an acquisition than just the price offered, and I was hoping maybe you could help us think through why your lower priced offer should win from your perspective, and if Anadarko's Board is forced to go back and quantitatively decide that this is -- your offer's not good enough, is there a point at which -- that if you look at this and -- not consider raising a bid, because its return's destructive  to you to do so. Mike Wirth : Sure. Well I won't speak for the Anadarko Board, but even with the information that was made public this week our offer was viewed by Anadarko as superior. And we have a signed merger agreements approved unanimously by the Boards of both companies. We strongly believe the combination of our two companies create superior long term value for shareholders of the combined company. The industrial logic of our transaction is very compelling. Anadarko's assets further strengthen already leading positions that we have in large and attractive shale, deep water and natural gas basins. It enables a further portfolio high grade and cost reductions and focused investments and an even stronger company. Our financial position and balance sheet strength enables us to take on the leverage and issue the additional equity and still continue to increase shareholder distributions.  Our companies simply have the best strategic fit. We can operate in the Gulf of Mexico in ways that others cannot. We're a world class operator of LNG, we've got leading performance in many different dimensions in the Permian. And that strong balance sheet mitigates risk. We won't be over levered coming out of the deal, we will be financially strong, with accretive cash flow and earnings and full and certain value. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please. Paul Sankey : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon from London. Mike, when we think about the potential for you to bid higher, we look at your balance sheet, and obviously there's a tremendous amount of firepower there, but we suspect it's not how you would be looking at potentially adding to your bid. Can you talk about the metrics that you're looking at in terms of Anadarko value to Chevron? Thank you. Pierre R. Breber: Yeah, and I want to close off. Phil actually asked a question that I failed to get to at the end of that last answer, which kind of ties to this? And Phil, yes, there is a -- we've been very disciplined as we've approached this, as we've looked at valuation. And I think you said, is there a point at which you're done? And of course the answer to that is yes, there is. And this isn't the time to address that specifically, but we've said we will do things that are value creating for our shareholders and we don't need to do anything. We got a very strong story without doing a transaction.  So Paul, to your question, we look at a whole host of metrics. And some of the primary ones are the accretion metrics. Does this give us accretive free cash flow after capital spending, does it give us creative earnings, do we get a strong return on this investment, and does it give us the investment queue, the investment set and opportunities over time to continue to improve return on capital, which the entire industry is working to improve, and this does. It gives us over 10 billion barrels of resource at less than $3 a barrel, which is an attractive resource acquisition cost. And so there are a whole host of metrics like that, that are the ones that we look at. Mike Wirth : Yeah, and, Paul, I don't know if your question was getting to the mix of the equity and cash. I mean, we've talked about the 75, 25 was mutually agreed to. Anadarko shareholders wanted exposure to our stock. We have a very good stock. But clearly we have the capacity to have alternative structures. We could put more -- we could have put more cash in if that's what Anadarko wanted to do, but we agreed to where we ended up. Paul Sankey : Yeah, I realize Mike, that you've talked about free cash flow, sort of point,  accretion I should say, from your point this needs to be the single metric that we should look at. We\u2019re just wondering how to think about that. Mike Wirth : So Paul, sorry, Was there another follow-up question in there? Paul Sankey : No, I think the other aspect was that you said if you can't  up, which is obviously a tough thing to measure. But it does seem that you have a great fit. Could you talk a little bit about Mozambique and how you see that? I think that's one of the differentiators between potentially between you and Occi. Thanks. Mike Wirth : Sure, as I discussed on the call a couple of weeks ago, we view Mozambique as a world class gas resource. We are pleased with the progress the product has made. It's a very cost competitive LNG project. And that matters. We do not intend to slow the project timeline down. We think that there's a good team of people working on this and that they've done a good job.  I plan to visit Mozambique soon to see the site and visit with both government leaders and people working on the project there. And we think that this fits well into our portfolio and with our strengths. And so we like the project. We think we can bring some value. We've got the balance sheet to support the project. We've got experience in things like shipping that, this will have a large shipping component. So I think there are ways we can improve and enhance execution and value and mitigate risk in execution of the project.  Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much. I guess my first question is related to your ability to operate in the Permian. And the reason I say that is, the competing bidder has talked about their ability to create the most return enhancement and their superiority as an operator. So Mike can you address where you think you benchmark relative to competition in terms of Permian development right now? Mike Wirth : Yeah, I mentioned earlier that we benchmark a wide range of metrics and you really need to look at performance in it's -- in all the dimensions. And there are ways that we've seen in the past Permian operators that will optimize certain metrics particular things like early production. We don't -- we are very careful about choke management to deliver the best ultimate recovery. But there are other operators that run with their chokes wide open and can show very strong early production numbers you look at it year out and there's quite a different picture that you see.  So I think number one, I would say you have to be very careful about which metrics you look at and we're focused on value creation and returns. Short-term production is not the goal and we're really looking at driving ultimately long-term recoveries, capital efficient model that generates leading EURs, a low cost per barrel and high returns and you take that you put it together with an advantage royalty position and we can deliver value that is difficult for anyone else to match.  And over time a company like ours has a technology capacity that few others have and we can add even more value as we drive costs down further as we improve recoveries and we see technology do what it always does, which is unlock greater degrees of performance. And so I will simply say that we look at our metrics and performance through a value lens and not a production lens. Jason Gammel : Appreciate that Mike. My follow-up question is at the time you announced the transaction you did raise the target on annual buybacks to 5 billion from what it had been before. I appreciate the run rates right now are affected by the transaction being in the public domain. But was the 5 billion -- was it increased to 5 billion contingent upon the deal completing or is that a run rate you would expect to have regardless. Mike Wirth : It was an announcement we made to indicate our strong confidence in the cash flow accretive and value creation that this transaction enables and so it is tied to the transaction, and as I said we got a strong case pre-existing the transaction with increase from a run rate of 3 billion last year to run rate of 4 billion this year and so the step up to five was a signal that this deal makes us even stronger. Pierre R. Breber: Yeah, if I can just clarify on again the first quarter buybacks were lower as Jason as you said we had to stop buying back shares, we thought there was prudent when we believe we could be we could find yourself in possession material nonpublic information related to transaction. So we expect these restrictions to continue in the second quarter circumstances could change and we could be able to buybacks shares in time to time but right expect low to no buybacks in the second quarter. And then post-closing, we intent to increase the rate to the $5 billion annual or $1.25 billion per quarter. Jason Gammel : Understood. Thanks guys. Mike Wirth : Thanks Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have one, on your expiration strategy and this also relates to Anadarko. But we look a long by the Permian in terms of synergies but it seems that is also quite little bit upside to exploration in the that if you combine the two portfolio and follow a infrastructure lead expiration strategy.  Could you just talk a little bit about that and how you thinking about that on the basis that this transaction just closed? And then the second question is there was a couple of articles in the year around you transferring your Permian royalty interest into a new subsidiary I was wondering if there is anything to that or that just a non-news. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Okay, so the first one expiration in the Gulf of Mexico. We talked earlier about that we would see expiration synergies as we bring the two companies together and our expiration portfolios. And we talked about the fact that we would have a very powerful infrastructure position in the Deepwater. When you combine that with extended reach tiebacks which we're in the final phases of technical qualifications to significantly expand the tiebacks that we can do. We can cover a lot of the Gulf of Mexico without necessarily needing new surface infrastructure and this allows us to begin to explore for accumulations that might not be economic on a standalone basis to For accumulations that might not be economic on a standalone basis to support a new Greenfield project, but that could be developed through drilling and tie back into existing infrastructures, platforms as, as All Ridge opens up.  And so it really enables a very different approach to exploration and I think a much higher return, shorter cycle, lower risk way to look at the next phase of development in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Not to say we might not have some Greenfield projects, because certainly there could be circumstances where that becomes the right economic outcome.  I\u2019d also point out that we -- we're an equity holder in a discovery that was just announced this week, the Blacktip Discovery, which Shell is the operator on encountered over 400 feet of net pay, it's about 30 miles away from Perdido and whale.  So we continue to see discoveries and we've got great strength in an area that has tremendous resource opportunity. And the challenge is to find ways to deliver it and generate better returns out of that.  Your question on the Permian royalty, what we've done is consolidated all of our royalties into an entity which allows us to manage that royalty with focus and efficiency and insure that as activity in the Permian continues to grow, and we have a strong royalty position that royalty is properly accounted for collected and managed. It certainly opens up options to do things that you've seen others do. I don't want to indicate that we would or would not do that. But it certainly positions us with an entity that could enable those kinds of alternatives if at some point we saw that as one that was desirable. Biraj Borkhataria : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Neil Mehta : Good morning team and Congrats, Pierre again on the new role. So the first question I had was actually on the oil macro. Two months away from the OPEC meeting. Prices have clearly been very firm here off bottom in 2019. Mike just wanted your perspective on some of the moving pieces as it relates to the oil macro. Has your view that we're an age of abundance fundamentally changed as you've had a more conservative worldview?  Or do you think price has been artificially lifted by OPEC cuts and how do you think about OPEC behavior from here, not asking you to forecast the price but your unique position to comment given the fact that you play across the value chain and you operate in some of these countries? Mike Wirth : Yeah, so\u2026 Pierre R. Breber: Let me give you my best shot on that one today, Neil. You know, global demand continues to be strong. We're seeing demand go up by, over a million barrels per day again this year, we had a very strong GDP number for the first quarter in the U.S., I think, surprisingly strong that has come out. Today. and, you know, we've consistently said that we don't see evidence of weakening around the world. We're across the value chain in many different products and many different geographies.  So, our economic growth looks solid and oil demand growth continues to march upward. You know, at the end of last year, as we saw some weakness, there were concerns about trade in China and economic activity and those have somewhat receded.  On the supply side, you've got the usual set of dynamics underway, right. We've got geopolitical issues with the Iran waivers not being extended, which creates the prospect of some tightness Venezuela continues to be very difficult, Libya is in and out of the news. And so you have some of the same things that create concerns and real tightness, in some cases on the supply side, and then you have OPEC plus the non-OPEC countries, which for the last couple of years, maybe three years or so have demonstrated the resolve to manage their supply in a way that's consistent with more stable markets. You throw on top of that commentary from the President, which again today, I guess he's out with comments about OPEC. And I think you still have OPEC in a place where they do play a role in creating a forward expectation on the supply side. And so in some ways the dynamics while the specifics of which countries might have supply issues and how the global demand picture rich countries might have supply issues and how the global demand picture shapes up. It's a story of forward expectations on supply and demand and then the geopolitical overlay that can change that. Fundamentally, we still believe that the world needs more of all types of energy and so we're in favor of renewable energy, we're in favor of conventional energy and economics markets and technology sorting out what the best mix is each country around the world. There is no shortage of resource to be developed. And so a cost matter and we continue to drive to be very competitive from a cost and supply standpoint. So I'm not I gave anything really brand new there, but that\u2019s how I see it. Neil Mehta : That's helpful. The follow up from our side is if we were to take the Anadarko transaction out of the equation, one of the concerns, some investors have expressed over the course of the year has been the Chevron have the portfolio that will drive in 2023 to 2028. And you kind of gave us some flavor of what that looks like at the Analyst Day post the Permian Ramp and post thingies what's the next wage of growth and sort of it begs the question was the Anadarko eventual transaction and all sense this transaction where a these types of transaction. So I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that, because I think your view here is that you do have a standalone opportunities at independent transaction but certainly something that's been brought up by investors. Mike Wirth : Yeah, absolutely, I said it in March, and I will say it. so again we do not have resource anxiety, we've been replacing reserves. We've got nearly 70 billion barrels of resource. We've given transparency on the production outcome for five years because people have wanted to see a longer view on that. And so you see this 3% to 4% growth now steadily being delivered over five years which is been difficult for companies to do consistently over an extended period of time at the scale that our company operates.  We're very confident that we can do that. and we stopped at five years just as a matter of convention not because we think there is a problem after that. And so unconventionals don't flatten out after that.  Our Permian position has got decades of resource not a few years. We tried to highlight our other shale and type resource position which are in the very early stages of development and continue to have very strong performance metrics and economics that our converging on Permian level economics which is really the goal that we've put in front of them. I've already talked on a call a little bit about deepwater where we've got Anchored Baltimore, Whale, Blacktip now.  We've got the ability to bring tie backs into a larger system or into the existing system, your question is ex the Anadarko transaction. We've got acreage in Brazil in Mexico in West Africa. So there are positions around the world and we've got, we're still operating in Venezuela where there is an enormous amount of resource and one day that will begin to be developed again. We got production offline and the partition zone.  I'll stop there but I'll simply say that the opportunities for us to invest in and develop resource that we hold today extends well beyond 2023 and it's a function of which projects competes the best for capital investments. A lot of short cycle stuff in there that is a pretty low risk and then there are some longer cycle things that are large and I think you'll see a blend of those deliver strong economic outcomes which is what drives our decision not production targets, but I think the cupboard is full not empty. Neil Mehta : Thanks guys. Mike Wirth : Thanks Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons Energy. Your question please? Blake Fernandez : Thanks guys good morning. Pierre I'm sorry to flag the buyback, but I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear on this. Is it fair to say 2Q buyback should essentially be zero and assuming that is the case, even when you ramp up to 1.25 per quarter, obviously than on a full year basis, we're going to come in below that $4 billion number due to Anadarko deal. Is that the correct way to look at it. Pierre R. Breber: Yeah, essentially and let me just restate it. So yeah, the $4 billion guidance was -- did not anticipate the transaction or an acquisition at the time. There are two sort of restrictions that we're operating under. One is when we're in possession of material non-public information we're not allowed to buy back shares. Even if and when that clears itself there are other restrictions on buybacks when there is a business combination happening and equities being issued.  So you can't buybacks during the proxy solicitation are other limitations on buybacks versus historical rates. So we're just operating under a different regime here during the transaction. Post-closing absolutely we have talked about the gross debt ratio being below 20%. Lots of capacity to increase it. So there could be some buybacks but again the guidance is low or no buybacks in the second quarter and then when we get post-closing, we will be a able to achieve the guidance and won't be encumbered by restrictions tied to the acquisition. Blake Fernandez : Very clear, thank you. The second question is really on the Permian and the more on the gas side. I know you've worked a lot to get firm take away capacity on the crude side, Wahoo pricing is been really weak. Can you talk about, I guess what alleviation avenues you have on that side as far as take away or improving your price realizations as you continue to grow there? Mike Wirth : Yeah, I will take that Blake and then Pierre might have some perspective as well. We have got take away capacity for all our production and so whether it's oil, NGLs or gas we are moving it and taking it to market. We are not engaged in routine flaring and would not intends to flare gas to enable production. And we had little bit of dry gas.  So if you don't have liquids right now, sometimes it's better just keep that gas in the ground for a better market. Our current production in the Permian is 75% liquids and 25% gas. We're focusing on liquid rich ventures, and as we described and you alluded to we been looking at take away capacity several quarters ahead of our production the entire time here.  I think what you've seen in the market is something that you should expect to see for a number of years in the future, which is you got a lot of people out there that are developing resource, you got a lot of people, investing in the midstream infrastructure and there are going to be times when those all sync up and you see pretty normal transportation type differentials and you'll see other periods of time where the market may anticipate some tightness and you will see the differentials widen out. I know Wahoo has been pretty ugly here lately. Kinder Morgan's got some pipes that come online this year and next year, which would probably start to change that equation, you know, the Mexico market has been a little slow to come than people expected. And we got some Wahoo exposure in our portfolio, but it's not anything that is material in the scope of our company and I think we're, like I said we are well positioned on the take away capacity across all the commodities quarter production in the future. Blake Fernandez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please. Jonathon Rigby : Thanks for taking my question. It's around the CapEx side and the capital side of the transaction actually. The first is something I don\u2019t think has got enough attention is the high grading process that will that you intend to indulge in after the deal closes. I just wanted to explore that because as we think about -- as we start to look at the future combination, we need to think about what it is you might be doing around that.  So I just wanted to confirm whether you see that as part of the value proposition, there's actually value to be delivered through that disposal process of the portfolio management that you can do.  Second is whether that processes is already underway? And thirdly, whether you can maybe lift the curtain a little and give us some idea about not necessarily assets but the kind of thought that you have around the type of portfolio you'd like to merge with, the things that you will be, the criteria which will be using.  And then the second question if I would just add somewhat lengthy. The billion dollars of CapEx efficiencies that you identified as part of the transaction, can you confirm that those are about doing the same thing for less, rather than just ramping down activities so we just can't compare like-for-like. Thanks. Mike Wirth : Okay, well, there is a lot in there, Jon. That was well done. So let me start with the portfolio and try to frame that up for you. And then I'll come to the capital. You asked about the process, we've got an ongoing process where we look at and high grading our portfolio. You know, we've had $2 billion to $3 billion in assets sales kind of on average, over a long period of time. We're continuing, always looking to high grade that portfolio from a strategic alignment standpoint, the ability to compete for capital, what the assets are, that will allow us to compete and deliver strong returns into the future. And oftentimes those may not be the same ones that satisfied that criteria in the past. As I thought last week, I mentioned to people if you go back about 15 years, when you think about our upstream portfolio, Tengiz was our real flagship asset. It was in the process of an expansion with SGI SGP that took 100% production from 350 to 650 or 7,000 barrels a day, our share of that was half. So we were on the way to the asset that we have today. And the Permian was kind of out of sight out of mind for most people.  Our Australia LNG projects had not been sanctioned, none of our LNG products have been sanctioned. And we were just beginning to move on off the shelf into the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. If you think about it today, in Australia, we're producing 400,000 barrels of equivalent at nice cash margins. Tengiz is on its way to a million barrels a day on 100% basis, our share half of that, so 500,000 a day.  The Permian we outlined is on its way to 900,000 barrels a day, our share and it doesn't stop when we get to that number. The Deepwater is with the combination the two companies is pushing close to 400,000 a day. So we now have four positions that have scale, that have resource depth and length, that have strong economics, that have lots of running room. And we have the ability to drive costs down and returns up through the way we manage and invest in those resources over time.  So it's a very different portfolio than when we would have had. Just one smaller asset and a lot of other ones that we\u2019re required to have the scale to compete. So we need to take a look at the rest of our portfolio and determine those assets that really can\u2019t still compete for capital and offer the low cost, high return characteristics, the resource length, and will compete for capital over time. I hope you're still with us, Jon, it sounds like you might be back\u2026 Jonathon Rigby : Yes, sorry. It's the classic timing of the annual -- the weekly test, apologies for that. Mike Wirth : All right, I'll be quick so you can comply. So we got a different portfolio and we will look to make some decisions on those assets that really will compete for capital that offer the resource potential and the value for our shareholders over time, what those are we will disclose as we get into transactions.  The capital that we've indicated -- you should think of it as both reductions in spend between the two companies and efficiency in that spent. So we'll look at contracts and the ability to execute and drive capital efficiency into the system and also drive overall spend down, while at the same time investing more in the Permian, which is what we indicated our intention is to do. So we will squeeze capital out of the combined system, we will squeeze efficiency into the combined system. And we will find ways to accelerate activity in the Permian which will bring value forward. Pierre R. Breber: And just to add, and we maintained a 3% to 4% guidance on production through 2023 as a combined company. Jonathon Rigby : Right, cool. Thank you and I'm perfectly safe. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Okay. I'm glad to hear that, Jon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Roger Read : Yeah. Good morning. Hopefully, you can hear me and I don't believe there are any problems in the background right now. I guess, Mike kind of an unusual situation here in terms of the bidding and typically you put your teams together, you expect them to be very focused going forward. I was wondering in an environment like this, do you end up having to divert people's attention to dealing with what may be an ongoing process here in terms of the Anadarko bid. And then how do you think about managing your way through that, kind of keeping everybody doing the things they need to do, plus the team that's focused here on the merger and integration and all that stuff? Mike Wirth : Look, I mentioned that we've put together joint integration teams already and that they met this week. And this isn't just a small group of people. This was a sizable group of people that spent multiple days together. And we've got a playbook for doing this. We did Unical a decade ago, Texaco a few years before that. We have some of the same people involved that lead those integrations. And and so, people have their eye on the ball and are focused on moving forward with things.  So just to remind everybody, we've got a signed deal that's been approved by both boards. And we're moving forward with integration planning so we can deliver value. Roger Read : Okay, well, good luck on that. Maybe to flip back and actually think about the operations here. In the quarter. We saw a little lighter on the gas side globally, stronger on the crude side. Just curious how much of that is we had some unplanned downtime I believe in Australia with the LNG. As you look going for this kind of global mix between oil and gas and taking into account maybe some dry gas remain shut into the Permian for a while. Mike Wirth : Yeah, I mean, I do think what you saw was primarily some downtime at one of the trends in Australia Gorgon. And because that's a bigger part of our portfolio now and we've got a train down for some work we will see that. The dry gas isn't a big number and so I wouldn't worry about that too much. There's also some weather in Australia that they create an impact. There's a cyclone that came through and we had to take some slowdowns at both Wheatstone and Gorgon, as we rode through that. So but those are really the things that are hitting the gas production. Roger Read : Just real quick, if I could follow up on that, is there any plan downtime between Gorgon and Wheatstone we should consider as we look at the rest of the year? Mike Wirth : Yeah, we're moving into normal turnaround mode now for both of those. The plan at Gorgon would be to only have one train down in any given year. And so our plan right now would be to execute train one on Gorgon later this year. The upstream in aggregate from a turnaround standpoint, the turnaround season begins really in the second quarter. You can think about the third quarter as probably the heaviest quarter because we'll have one of the KTL lines at TCO in turnaround there. And then as we go third into fourth quarter, you'll see one train at Gorgon down for a turnaround. But it's we're into the normal operations and turnaround cycle with LNG plants. Pierre R. Breber: And Roger, this is Pierre. I mean, we generally will provide guidance if there's heavy upstream turnaround activity in the earnings call. Roger Read : Appreciate that. Thank you guys. Pierre R. Breber: Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting on the call. Mike. As you know, we are big fans of what you guys have done here, but I want to ask a little bit of a sensitive question, if I may. There's been some speculation, I guess, some fact checking in the press that given the Anadarko already had a bid in hands from Occi, as per their letter, they then went ahead and increased their change of control for their senior management. I wonder if you could speak to your opinion on that. And how what perspective you would offer in terms of perhaps the history of your, your discussions that may be led to that point. Obviously it's a little bit sensitive, but it's something that some shareholders are raising some concern about. Mike Wirth : Yeah, Doug, there are numerous aspects of our negotiation in the deal that will be explained in the S4 filing, it is premature and inappropriate for me to comment on any of the aspects of how this all came together. I'd encourage you just to read the S4 when it's filed. Doug Leggate : Okay, I knew it was going to be a tough one to answer. So I appreciate you trying. My more specific question to Gorgon . Obviously post deal, those are going to be a very significant tailwind from synergies and all the things that you've laid out. One assumes that if you did match the higher bid, does that change anything by way of your buy plans, that would then go through that to any of those kind of issues. And what I'm really getting at is that if for some reason you did hit a high bar or you did not decide to move forward and not event I realize it's unlikely, but the bulk of your future growth due to '2023 is largely it looks like a lot of it is coming from Permian gas.  So I'm just curious how absent this deal, would you be able to sustain the buybacks and commit to a strong growth trajectory for dividends? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yeah, I'm not going to speculate on what Anadarko\u2019s Board may do and how that plays out. I'll just tell you in our base case, we produce 75% liquids in the Permian. So it's not primarily gas. We've indicated that we expect to see our industry leading cash margins sustained as the production grows. And that we've initiated a buyback program that we intend to stick with through any reasonable commodity price environment. And so there are not risks to the cash that would support shareholder distributions here in the vein of what you're talking about. So we're very confident in the plan we've laid out and our ability to deliver. Thanks, Doug. Mike Wirth : Good luck. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Mike Wirth : Sam. Might be muted. Sam Margolin : Can you hear me now. Mike Wirth : Yes, we can. Sam Margolin : Just muted. Sorry about that. I just have a quick question. We've been through a lot on the Anadarko topic already. I've got a question for Pierre, a follow up to the TCO topic earlier. You know, if TCO keeps taking up the co-lending program, theoretically, it's to preserve dividends. But if that's happening at the same time that commodity prices are broadly higher than what was planned for, does that flow into the Chevron Capital program as sort of like a net cash surprise or is the authorization part of your sort of free cash flow outlook and it's not dynamic what TCO decides to do?  And then just as a follow-up, like if it's the former, does Chevron then have headroom to rotate cash at the Chevron level into other things like Permian, incremental Permian, for example. Pierre Breber : Yeah, thanks. No, the financing doesn't impact capital, how we characterize capital. So the capital is going to be what is invested in the project. Again, that's affiliate capital. So non cash capital. What can vary is where I thought you were going is if prices are higher than there's clearly more cash generation within TCO and therefore their ability to balance making investments and paying dividends is easier. And you might pull less on the loan. So again, we're giving guidance on the financing but it is subject to prices -- level of investments that are happening and the level of dividends. All of those are in interplay.  But if prices stay higher, longer than that gives them more flexibility to either decrease the lending or the borrowings or increase the dividends. In either case, that's more cash to the company, it shows up in different parts of the cash flow statement. But in either case, does not affect CapEx. Sam Margolin : Okay, yeah, that's why I was asking because it sounded like there was a potential outcome where TCO is self-funding and inclusive of the dividend, but they still uptake the co-lending, in which case, you've got like surplus cash, but I guess it's not, it wouldn't affect anything else. So okay. All right, thank you very much. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Sam. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question, please. Jason Gabelman : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I'm not going to ask about the Anadarko, deal, because it seems like it's been covered on the call. I want to actually ask about what's going on in California right now, just given you guys are -- have a pretty big footprint in the state Congress is in the process of reviewing a bill to kind of institute a change in how oil production goes on there, kind of the setback rule similar to what Colorado tried to put forth. I'm wondering, what do you see as potential risks, if any, to your portfolio in the state, both on the refining side, and the production side, relative to that regulation? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Okay. Jason. Yeah. So California has pretty aggressive ideas on regulating our industry and what you referred to is AB 345 which is in the assembly right now, wouldn\u2019t impact downstream at all. It's really -- you think of it is analogous to what has been going on in Colorado and the primary concern is setbacks for activity. Our portfolio in California is primarily in the San Joaquin Valley and it tends to be an area where it's not populated the same way the LA basin is, which is where historically there was a lot of the roots of our company and a lot of the industry trace their way back into the LA basin.  And so there you got a much more densely populated urban and suburban land-use metrics and concerns about the proximity of drilling activities to residential schools commercial et cetera is really what's behind this.  So we're working closely with state government to ensure they understand the impacts, others in industry and trade associations are as well. And so it's prospective legislation that is being considered here. It really impact permitting for new wells doesn't impact things that are already in production and we get a big producing business that's online today and then I think our portfolio is in part of the state that would likely be less impacted than if our production were more heavily concentrated into the LA basin. Mike Wirth : Okay, thank you very much. Jason I think we are right about the top of the hour here and I know everybody's busy on a Friday. So want to thank everyone for your time today. Appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on the call today. Jonathan back over to you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead. Wayne Borduin : Thank you Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. And Pierre? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Wayne. We had another solid quarter. The company delivered record production, led by continued strength in the Permian Basin and at Wheatstone in Australia. Jay will provide more detail shortly. First, an overview of our financial results. Earnings were $4.3 billion or $2.27 per share. This is the highest reported quarterly result since the third quarter 2014 when Brent was over $100 a barrel. The quarter's results include special lighting gains, totaling $920 million from the Anadarko termination fee and a tax rate change in Alberta. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $15 million. Excluding special items and FX gains earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.77 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was almost $8 billion excluding working capital changes. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio. Importantly our continued strong cash flow allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends. And after terminating our agreement with Anadarko, we resumed buybacks and repurchased $1 billion of shares during the quarter. Going forward we expect share buybacks at the $5 billion annual run rate or $1.25 billion per quarter, in line with our updated guidance stated in May. We also continued to maintain capital discipline with a focus on increasing returns. Year-to-date organic CapEx was $9.6 billion, a little less than half of our $20 billion budget. Total CapEx, which includes acquisition costs that are unbudgeted such as the purchase of the Pasadena refinery, totaled $10 billion. Turning to slide 4. Cash flow was strong and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Cash flow from operations excluding working capital increased this quarter due to growing production volumes and higher liquids realizations as well as the termination fee received from Anadarko. Jay Johnson : Thanks Pierre. On Slide 7, second quarter oil equivalent production increased 9% compared to a year ago with shale and tight production increasing in the Delaware and Midland Basin and production from major capital projects increasing with ramp-ups at Wheatstone, Hebron, and Big Foot. Our base business production increased as Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater brownfield developments more than offset natural declines across the portfolio. Turning to Slide 8, second quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the third straight quarter. Year-to-date production excluding asset sales is about 5% higher than 2018 consistent with our guidance of 4% to 7% growth as shown by the middle bar. Second quarter production was impacted by planned turnarounds and asset sales which together had an impact of almost 70,000 barrels a day. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Big Foot and Hebron. This growth will be partially offset by higher turnaround activity in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is expected to be in line with this guidance even before adjusting for the entitlement impacts of higher prices. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, through our joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, we announced two new petrochemical investments, one in the U.S. Gulf Coast and one in Qatar. Each is in the joint venture with Qatar Petroleum. The long-term fundamentals of chemicals are strong. We believe these projects offer attractive returns underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, world-class scale and leading technology. Also in the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Denmark and executed an agreement to sell our U.K. Central, North Sea fields which we expect to close later this year. Additionally, we completed our acquisition of the Pasadena refinery which will enable us to supply more of our retail market in the region and process more domestic light oil. In the renewable space, we recently agreed to purchase wind power to supply our Permian operations. This is a cost-effective renewable energy alternative to our current electricity supply in the Permian. Also Chevron executed an agreement to be an equity partner in CalBioGas, a joint venture to produce end market, dairy biomethane as a vehicle fuel in California. The project will capture methane that otherwise would be vented into the atmosphere and process it into renewable natural gas. Turning to slide 15. Our performance this quarter reinforces four key messages you've heard from us in the past. First, we have an advantaged portfolio that is delivering today and is positioned to do so over the long-term as Jay highlighted in the Permian Gulf of Mexico and at Tengiz. Wayne Borduin : We\u2019re here. Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. Would you like to take questions at this time? Wayne Borduin : I believe we were cut off prematurely, so actually we'll begin with slide 16. Operator : All right. You may resume. Pierre Breber : Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. This is Pierre and we understand that we cut off at slide 16, so I'm going to resume there and we're going to look ahead. In Upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7%, excluding 2019 asset sales. Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Nigeria and the North West Shelf and Australia as well as the early July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to impact production in the third quarter. Our full year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion depending upon price, investment profile, and its dividends. In downstream, we expect high level of refinery turnaround activity in the third quarter which guides to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than $200 million. For the third quarter, we expect a repurchase -- we expect to repurchase shares at a rate of $1.2 billion per quarter. With that I'll hand the call back over to Wayne. Wayne Borduin : Thanks Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please. Phil Gresh : Yes, hi good morning. Can you hear me all right? Wayne Borduin : Good morning Phil. Phil Gresh : Yes. So, I guess first question just looking at this Permian additional disclosure and your cash flow expectations, it seems like what you're implying here is that you can grow earnings and cash flow and the ratio of cash flow to CapEx keeps going up. So, it seems to imply pretty flattish CapEx profile, which I think is fairly consistent with the rig count trajectory you talked about at Analyst Day. So, I was wondering if you could maybe just kind of walk through that detail. And then secondarily with -- related to that I know you recently had an announcement that you made with enterprise talking about takeaway out of the Permian. I was just wondering how that all feeds into this ability to ensure you get the best realizations for your production. Thanks. Jay Johnson : Okay. I'll take it and Pierre may want to add some at the end. From a CapEx standpoint, Phil, we are looking to maintain a relatively flat profile in capital and that's because essentially we're looking to have a very steady rig fleet as we go forward. We have 20 company-operated rigs. Those are basically on a 100% basis because we operate our own licenses. And then we look for about 30 roughly gross non-operated rigs which equates to about seven to 10 net non-operated rigs. So, as we move that forward, we expect to see capital relatively constant. We're building out infrastructure of course and we always have some exploration activity out in front of us and we also do pilot work to ensure that we are continuing to drive to increase the recovery and efficiency of our developments. In terms of the takeaway capacity, I'll break it into three different streams. I'll start with the crude oil and basically for 2019, we're well covered on our takeaway capacity for crude oil. In 2020, we are also covered for the year. There may be periods of tightness in length as we move through the year, but we recently executed an agreement with enterprise not only for takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin, but also for export capacity that will lengthen our ability to supply crude not only in the domestic U.S., but internationally. When we look at natural gas liquids, we have full takeaway capacity for this year and next year. And as we turn to gas, we really think of gas in two ways. The first is just basic flow assurance. We need to be able to move the gas without having to flare or have any threat of mitigating production in our avoidance of flaring. So we have 100% flow assurance set up for the balance of this year and next year. In terms of takeaway of gas from the basin outward for export, what we look at is this year we're at about 20% of our gas can be exported from the basin. And by the end of this year, we expect to be about 25%. By the end of next year we should be more like 60% of our gas being exported from the basin gives us more exposure to other price structures rather than just the Waha. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Phil. Phil Gresh : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Just my follow-up question then for Pierre would just be some of your balance sheet commentary. Your net debt-to-cap, I believe is a low sicne it\u2019s been since mid-2015. I know you increased the buyback a bit. There's the situation where you had an M&A considerations there that you walked away from, but I guess how do you think about that level of financial leverage? And where you want to keep that balance sheet for opportunities that might present themselves? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yeah. Well, thanks Phil. Look our cash generation has been strong and we've been returning cash to shareholders and we increased our dividend 6% early this year. As you mentioned we raised our guidance on the share buyback rate in May to $5 billion per year. We're being very disciplined with capital, managing to our $20 billion organic budget in 2019. So the way the math works, no doubt in the short-term, our strong balance sheet gets even stronger. That's okay. Over time this strong cash generation will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained share buyback program. That's the way I would think about it. I won't comment on M&A. We, obviously, have -- we're in a very financially strong position, same time we got a great value proposition for our shareholders that we've communicated at our March Analyst Day and then Jay provided more insight into some key elements today and that's what we're focused on delivering. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Phil. Phil Gresh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Good morning team. I guess, the first question I have Jay, you just came back from Kazakhstan sounds like. There's \u2013 there was some questions around labor productivity as it relates to Tengiz. Can you just confirm everything is on track and then just in terms of the capital budget as well your confidence level in achieving the targets that you set out? Jay Johnson : Yes. We just did come back in June and we talked about this at the Security Analyst Meeting and in previous calls. A big focus at site now is on labor productivity. We've got a lot of work to do as the modules come in or set on foundations. Last year we're primarily focused on civils and undergrounds. This year we're making the transition to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation. As we look forward we have to get through commissioning and then all the start-up activities. So we've put in place specific tools that can really help us, not only drive the productivity but understand what the drivers are, where we have gaps, from where expectations are and what we need to do to close those. Those tools are now widespread across the site and are proving to be very effective, so we've seen steadily improving productivity across the workforce and are actually feeling pretty good about where the execution is headed at this point. But it's early days. We're 40%, roughly complete on construction and we've got a lot of man-hours to go over the next couple of years. In terms of the overall capital program, you've seen we continue to be right in the middle, right on our guidance. We're about 50% expanded on our Chevron C&E through mid-year and we still expect to maintain our guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion for next year, so that should give you a pretty good idea of where things sit. Neil Mehta : Appreciate this. And just a follow-up question, this might be for you Pierre. You've gotten a lot of credit from investors for stepping away from the Anadarko potential transaction and showing the capital discipline. Since the deal closed, the stock has materially outperformed other constituents of the XLE or XOP and others, independent E&Ps and that multiple arbitrage or share price ratio arbitrage seems to be opening up again. Just want to get your thoughts on M&A. Again, it felt opportunistic, but is another opportunity potentially opening up here? Pierre Breber : Yeah. No. Thanks Neil. Look, I honestly can't speculate on M&A. What I can restate is we have a very strong value proposition for our shareholders. And if I can just -- some of the key elements that we communicated in March is 3% to 4% production growth guidance through 2023, a very disciplined capital program. Jay provided the 2020 guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion and longer-term guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion from 2021 to 2023. We have leading upstream cash flow margins, leading earnings margins and we're improving cash return on capital employed by more than 3%. So, we clearly do not need to do a deal. That said, as you said, we have been opportunistic in the past if we see a good strategic fit at a good price, at a good value. And two recent examples would be the Pasadena refinery and Anadarko. But we've moved on and we're focused on delivering growing earnings and cash flows for our shareholder. Neil Mehta : Thanks Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please. Alastair Syme : Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about Anchor, which you're hoping to do FID next year? What do you think has to happen to move that forward? Because my understanding is, there are still some quite significant technological challenges. And the follow-up, if you can just talk a little bit, it's just sort of a question, just on the asset sales, that you announced the U.K. asset sales in the quarter. Can you talk about what happens on the decommissioning of liabilities associated with those assets, please? Jay Johnson : Yeah. So with Anchor, we are in the FEED process, so this is doing all the preliminary engineering work prior to the detailed engineering. I would say there are two primary technologies to be developed to support Anchor. And in developing for Anchor, we'll also have these available for other opportunities that we foresee. The first is just the high-pressured technology, getting to that 20,000-psi. That's well along and we really -- it really comes down to just thicker seal. We're in the qualification stages and we really don't see that as a major technology shift. It's just a matter of working through the process. And the second is the higher hook loads for deeper wells and this will also support potential developments like Ballymore. So neither of those do we regard as a particularly challenging technological advance, but an important one to get finished. So we do expect to be on path with Anchor for FID early in the next year. In terms of the North Sea deal, we really don't get into the details of any of our commercial transactions. I can't really comment too much on that, other than to say, as an overall package we're very comfortable with the transaction as its been constructed and are working with the buyer to move it forward to close. Pierre Breber : Yes. And I think I can add to Jay's comments that, we're fully in-tune with the importance of embedded obligations and that's carefully considered in terms of the financial strength of the partners or the parties that we transact with. And again we won't be specific as it's commercially sensitive, but its -- as you can imagine the point of negotiation and something that we don't intend to be exposed to over time. Alastair Syme : Thanks very much. Pierre Breber : Thanks Alastair. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. And apologies, if I miss this on the call but, I have a question on LNG. You mentioned a higher ratio of spot LNG sales in the quarter. Could you just talk through what was driving that? One of your payers has talked about buyers for their contracts not taking their full nominations. I was wondering if that was the issue or there's something else there. Thank you. James Johnson : Yes, thanks Biraj. I'll talk first in general because there's an element of -- as we gain in our performance, the facilities are performing very well, reliability is coming up, we have extra production over and above what we had planned and so all that production is going to be exposed to spot prices. And so that's going to be an ongoing thing. In the second quarter specifically, we certainly had excellent performance at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And so we had extra production coming from that. But at the same time we also deferred a turnaround, so we had a turnaround scheduled in the second quarter that's been moved to the fourth. So we had extra cargoes there that were exposed to spot. We do have some downward flex that was exercised by our purchasers in the shoulder months and that occurred in the second quarter. And then finally, there's also an element even in our fixed-term contracts where we had about a 3 to 6 month delay in the oil pricing that they're linked to and so we saw some downward movement in that element. So together those all really drive the realizations in the second quarter for our LNG. But as I say going forward, we do expect to see increased production as our reliabilities been higher and our overall goal would be to term that up and get closer to what our expected production is as we gain continued confidence in the reliability of the facilities. Biraj Borkhataria : That's great color. And just a quick follow-up. At Gorgon in particular I think in the past you talked about debottlenecking the project to increased capacity buy maybe 10% or 15%. Could you just update us on where we are now and relative to the original nameplate? James Johnson : Yes I don't recall us giving out specific guidance on percentages of increase. Our focus right now is doing a couple of things. First is just getting the reliability increasingly high and we've seen very good reliability. We're still learning these facilities as we continue to operate and we built learnings from some of the shutdowns and turnarounds that we've already accomplished in the future ones. As we look forward, what we are looking at is we're collecting the data literally daily as we move through an annual cycle of the ambient conditions as well as the performance of the plan. We look for where the restructuring to keep us from going to the next level of production. At this point in time, I'd say we're probably 2% above where we expect it to be on Gorgon production, around 6% above on Wheatstone. But it's an ongoing effort as we move forward to get more out of our existing investments and infrastructure. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Biraj. Biraj Borkhataria : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please. Jon Rigby : Okay, thank you. Yeah. The first is the Anadarko transaction during that process, I felt that you indicated that you had capacity and the willingness to deepen your deepwater participation globally and you spoke quite enthusiastically about adding extra LNG to your portfolio, creating a global position et cetera. So as you move forward with new opportunities and when they arise, is -- thematically outside of the U. S. is that where we should expect you to be appearing or looking? And then the second, just very specifically, with the new refinery asset, what are the plans for that now you've got ownership of it? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yeah. Thanks Jon. This is Pierre and I'll start. I said earlier we moved on, but look we\u2019ll go back to Anadarko a little bit here. Look there are several elements of it, the transaction there was the FID in the Permian, there was the FID in the Gulf of Mexico and there was the LNG. And there was the ability to get synergies out of the transaction and do it at an attractive price that we thought was good for their shareholders and good for our shareholders. So that -- if you want to get into our thinking we\u2019re -- adding LNG is something that absolutely we are interested in doing. We've got a great position in Australia that Jay just talked about that's generating a lot of cash where we have opportunities to debottleneck and potentially add to that over time. And you'd expect that we are -- we're always working the portfolio and LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in and we'll pursue opportunities in that space. That makes sense for the company and our shareholders. In terms of Pasadena, we've had three very clear strategic objectives on it. One was to provide some equity product into our retail network in Texas. The second was to coordinate and optimize feedstocks and other flows between Texas and our refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. And the third was to process more domestic light oil and increasingly try to position and retool the refinery a little bit to take more and more Permian oil. So really, I mean there -- it's very early days, but I'd say everything is on track and aligned with the strategic rationale. So there's been no surprise in terms of those three objectives. We feel we can meet them with the acquisition. We've had some early wins. In fact over the next few months we expect to run up to 30,000 barrels a day of Permian crude oil. That's a little more than we actually had thought at this point in time. Also we know there's work to do as expected on maintenance and reliability of the facility. So everything is on track and we feel good about it but it's early days. Thanks, Jon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much. Hello guys. I had a couple on the Permian, slide number 10. I guess the first one would be, obviously, some fairly impressive absolute performance in increasing EUR and decreasing development production cost on an absolute basis. I know you do a lot of benchmarking. How would you say stack up against industry in those areas now? James Johnson : Yes it's a good question, Jason. I think the -- we do, do a lot of benchmarking and this continues to be an evolving story. So I would say, we're competitive on these areas. We have a very good understanding particularly in terms of the type curves across the entire basin. We have the capability and actually run decline curves across not only our own, but competitors as well so that we understand how our wells are performing and we're actually very comfortable with the overall performance not only in terms of the recoveries, but the economics that we're generating from the execution work. And then when that's coupled up with our ability to use our midstream capability and our royalty position, it's really giving us, I would say leading financial performance overall. So if you went back and look at our Security Analyst Meeting slides, we showed you some of the competitor data. We also showed you, how our actual type curves are performing relative to our expectations and they're very tightly coupled. So I think we have a good understanding, but we're seeing that continued improvement as we move forward. Pierre Breber : Yes. The only thing I would add to Jay's comments, this is Pierre. You can cherry pick a lot of data out there to position how you look. We've been pretty consistent with what we've shown. And also we've done a lot, not just general benchmarking, but comparisons to our non-op partners or the operators on our behalf, where we know we have very good apples-to-apples data. So it is an area of focus and we feel we compete very well. Jason Gammel : That's great. And maybe just \u2013 yeah, just a quick follow-up. I noticed the average lateral length that's planned for 2020 is starting to approach 10,000 feet. In the past you've had fairly frequently slides about swapping another positioning to kind of block up your acreage. And if you're moving towards 10,000 feet, I'm suspecting you're getting a long ways towards doing that, but can you just kind of talk about whether there's further opportunity there? James Johnson : Well as we continue -- in the existing development areas we're getting higher and higher on our average lateral length and approaching that 10,000 foot mark. In the areas that we've transacted, we had about 60,000 acres that we transacted in 2017 and 95,000 acres in 2018. Those enabled -- about 1,900 longer laterals. So it's really helped us in our core-up development areas. As we continue though to open up new development areas, we're going to continue to have this land activity as we optimize our land positions. So about half of our acreage overall, we consider to be a very highly productive areas and what we want to do is continue to use swap out or swaps and farm-out, sales, acquisitions to continue to core up our development areas. We try and do that in a timely manner. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we do want to make sure that we're drilling efficiently as we start each area. As we said many times, our focus is on delivering returns not just chasing production or chasing a certain activity level. Jason Gammel : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Doug Leggate : Thanks, good morning everyone. I was wondering if Jay, I could take advantage, you been on the call just a little bit in terms of the assumptions you made in the Permian on the cash margins, things have obviously deteriorated at no fall of your, you do in terms of NGLs and gas. So if -- how do you see the prognosis there? What assumptions were you making when you were talking about CapEx versus cash flow? And I guess kind of the last piece of that question is 900,000 barrels a day at a 3.3, 3.4 in 2023 suggests that your cash margin across the portfolio could move away from this sort of sector within level you've had in the past. I'm just curious if you can offer any thoughts on that. I've got a follow-up please. Jay Johnson : Well, the cash -- the assumptions that we provided that are all given in our Security Analyst Meeting deck, so you can go back and reference those. And what we\u2019re trying to do is, continue to make sure we have the flow assurance as I mentioned earlier on the call, to move gas out to other markets and not have it captured in the immediate basin. Crude oil, we're already well ahead of that. We move our crude outside the basin and we can access and optimize the markets that we're reaching. In terms of the cash margin overall, again we've given you that information. We see that is very strong. There's always going to be fluctuations in the markets as there's tightness and length in different locations. But overall, we feel pretty strong about where we\u2019re heading with this as a production base but also the other production we have around the world. Doug Leggate : Okay. I understand, it's -- there's a lot of moving parts in that. My follow-up is kind of related and it's historically when oil prices got a lot weaker, you guys talked routinely about what your sustaining capital was in the portfolio. And obviously, that has been reset favorably by the very large LNG projects and those kind of dominate the base -- the base decline and like thereof. As you move towards, again, this level of funding a significantly larger proportion of your production and a high decline underlying unconventional asset base, what does that do to the sustaining capital versus, I think, you used to talk about like a $13 billion number, how does that evolve as we move towards the five-year plan. Pierre Breber : Doug, yeah. This is Pierre and I'll start and ask Jay to add some comments. We've never really talked about sustaining capital. We've given -- we have a $20 billion capital budget this year that we talked about $18 billion to $20 billion dollars guidance next year. And then $19 billion to $22 billion, 2021 to 2023. So the guidance is pretty clear, it's pretty tight. That results in enterprise that's growing 3% to 4% of production growth through 2023 with leading cash margin. So the prior eight times, we've talked about the base decline, we are investing in the unconventional, as you saw, in the Permian that it's -- the production is more than doubling, while it's being free cash flow every year, starting next year, at returns that are going from 20% to 30%. So we feel really good about our position. We're not focused on keeping a base flat capital. We're focused on increasing returns. It's resulting in an outcome of higher production. That's translating to higher earnings and cash flow. But the high decline that you referred to is, it's a nature of the business. But when we're investing in it, you can see that, we're more than offsetting that decline and we're doing it in a very economic manner. And as we continue to fill out facilities and keep facilities filled over time, the reinvestment is a very attractive use of capital for the shareholders. Jay Johnson : I might just build on what Pierre said, because he's absolute right. As we have a larger percentage of our overall production constrained by facilities, that means we have the ability to be very stable on our production. And the same in some respects actually applies in the Permian, while any individual well may have a relatively high decline rate, it does approach an asymptotic curve. But the facilities we install for each of the development areas, our goal is to keep those full. And one of the advantages of the Permian is that, in the initial drilling we fill the facilities up, but then we can go back through infill drilling programs and by going after the subsequent benches in a given development area, and just continue to keep those facilities full, and the amount of rig activity it takes is much less for those subsequent drilling campaigns to maintain that production in a given development area. So I actually feel pretty good about where the whole portfolio has moved and really I'm not too worried about what some people see as a problem with these individual Permian wells. Doug Leggate : It\u2019s a great answer guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Doug\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Wayne Borduin : Morning Roger. Roger Read : Let me just dive in here. Kind of following-up on some of the Permian questions, with your royalty position and others developments and with some of the problems we're seeing from some of those E&Ps, any risk to your outlook from those who might have overstepped their bounds in terms of the way they were developing the Permian? Pierre Breber : Well, Roger this is Pierre. I mean, you're right. I mean we don't control the royalty barrels because that's being operated by others who own the working interests we're landowner and as Jay said, we receive those barrels with no capital, no operating costs. But the flipside is that if we don't control the development, so we're doing it based on an outlook and an expectation, it certainly we know what the actual had been. But you're right that there is some risk of that. It could go either way. It could go bigger or lower than what we're showing dependent on what those operator's activity levels are. Roger Read : Okay, great. And then from a guidance standpoint on the downstream, the hiring refinery turnaround activity, and for the third quarter I was under the impression you'd had fairly high turnaround activity earlier in the first half of this year. So I was just curious was that the right interpretation, and maybe if there's any geographic specific exposure on the high TARs at this quarter. Pierre Breber : Yeah Roger, so we have now adopted a practice of giving a pretty clear guidance on planned turnaround activity in the downstream and we characterize it as either a low, medium or high. So you're right. Second quarter was high. And that's related to $200 million of after tax, earnings impacts both from higher cost and from lost profit opportunity if the volume is not produced. First quarter was actually low, which is up to $100 million of effects. So in the third quarter with another high quarter that's not unusual, it just depends on how the planned turnarounds are set up. We won't provide specifics on the locations. It's commercially sensitive. And so it's just something that we won't do ahead of time, we're happy to talk about it. Looking backs on the second quarter, we had some planned turnaround activity in Pascagoula and in Asia. So we can explain afterwards, but we think we're giving pretty clear guidance. So you're right that you should view the earnings -- after tax earnings impact of planned turnarounds in 3Q to be the same or similar to 2Q. Roger Read : Pierre, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Wayne Borduin : Thanks Roger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Howard Weil. Your question please. Paul Cheng : Hi good morning. Jay, since you are here and I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the incident in Tengiz with your contractor at least in the media, it seems to me that there's never been more serious talking about -- a between the foreign contractor and the local people and may even be different agenda. Can you give us little bit more update on that and what -- does any initiative had been taken trying to resolve the problem there? Jay Johnson : Yes, Paul, I can give you a little bit more. We -- this is really centered around one particular contractor that was at the 3GP site and there was obviously some disagreements between some of their workers and the management of that company. When the issue happened, we shut down the entire site -- the 3GP site, not the other site that didn't have any impact on production operation, but we wanted to make sure that the problem was mitigated and contained and we understood what was at the root of it. We worked with that contractor. They're putting in place corrective actions to make sure that they deal with some of the concerns that were there. That is the only contractor that's had an extended ramp-up, so they're working back to their normal strength and we expect to see them that normal strength by the end of August. So, at this point in time, we don't see it as having a material impact on the overall progress of the work. That contractor was about one month ahead of where we expected them to be on their workflow. So, unfortunately we've used up some of that float that have built up, but we believe we're going to be able to mitigate the impact to us. The worker and the workforce relations are always important to us and this is one that we continue to stay focused on. It's very important as now our focus continues to shift to site and I assure you we'll stay focused with our workforce to make sure that we're trying to anticipate and deal with any other concerns. Paul Cheng : And the second question Jay. I think in Angola Block 14, I think that the expiration is 2023. And in Nigeria the Agbami I think is 2024. When you guys will start the process for renegotiation on those? Jay Johnson : Well, that's not something we normally are going to talk much about publicly, Paul. That's between us and our partners and the government. So, I can tell you that those discussions and the planning for that is well in hand, but I really won't be able to go into much detail on those at this time. Paul Cheng : Okay. Understand. Thank you. Wayne Borduin : Thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Hi. Wayne Borduin : Hey Sam. Sam Margolin : So, in the Permian one of the things that you talked about contributing to your rig count staying relatively flat is that you're building up a nice stack of vintage wells and you've got some legacy production that's supporting the performance of new wells. Just really quickly Jay can you shed some light on the performance of those older wells? It sounds like you're leading edge wells are meeting your expectations, but how are the vintage wells doing as far as how are they holding up and as they get a little long in the tooth? Jay Johnson : Actually they're doing quite well. Our focus from day one has been to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. So, there has been a lot of questions why don't we increase our rig fleet, why don't we be more aggressive? But the reality is to continue to learn as everyone in the industry as we move forward and I think a lot of the moves we've made to stay focused on returns now are paying off. Many people talk about how high their initial production rates are in the first six months rates, but what we're really looking at that can actually damage wells and cause aggregated decline curves. So, we're looking at the total expected recovery. We're looking at the economics of the well over its life. We're very careful in our drawdown rates in those early months to make sure that we don't cause damage in the wellbore or in the formation. When we put all that together, we're seeing our base production. That is the production that's already online continuing to perform such that, when we drill these new wells, we can add that on top. And as you saw from the chart, I believe it was on probably page nine, we've been able to continue to deliver right on our production profile and we feel very good about how our wells are performing. Sam Margolin : Thank you so much. And then - this one should be relatively quick and just in reference to the strategic partnership between CPChem and Qatar, Qatar's got a portfolio of other things that Chevron is probably a good candidate to participate in. Do you see that relationship deepening as you kind of advance on the chemical side throughout the Chevron organization? Or do you see that siloed into Chems? James Johnson : No. No. Look, we have a good relationship with Qatar Petroleum for sure and so do CPChem. And when the Qataris look at CPChem they look at it as three companies, right; Chevron Phillips, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And so, we have a good relationship with them. I will say that the trend \u2013 the deals stand on their own, I mean, the project in Qatar was bid out at U.S. Gulf Coast again there's other alternatives that are considered. So each transaction stands on its own. But we're very proud that we have this platform within and whether that leads to other opportunities or not I won\u2019t speculate, but we certainly have a good base to work-off of. Sam Margolin : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. You alluded to the gas takeaway issues in the Permian and that you're trying to avoid flaring as much as possible. But of course your realized gas price was $0.60 in Q2. So I'm curious if it might get to a point where you have no practical choice, but to either flare gas or shut in wells. And if that happens which would you choose? James Johnson : We don't flare. We are not flaring and we haven't flared. Our policy is that, we find flow assurance as I said is our first priority so that we can move the gas and we've been doing that. And we've got that flow assurance covered. So I don't see us being forced into the choices that you just presented. I do -- as I said earlier, we're going to be increasing the amount of export capacity out of the basins to try and achieve better realizations and that's part of our overall strategy to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. And then based on what I just asked, but taking on a much broader perspective. You're talking about reducing carbon emissions. Just about every other U.S. oil and gas producers talking about the same, when we listen to what's being said on stage at the debates, I'm sure you saw this week that point seems to be lost on the policy community. And I'm curious what you think the industry has not communicated that is -- or what the dynamic is that has led to this disconnect between what you're saying and what the policymakers seem to be believing? Pierre Breber : Well Sam that's a big last question on the call here. Look I mean, it depends which policymaker is right. We're in the midst of a energy revolution, renaissance here in the United States. For sure, wind and solar is a big part of that, but what's going on in the Permian Basin, what's happened in the Marcellus and Utica and growing natural gas production, growing crude oil production, exports to world markets and all the geopolitical implications and benefits of that, you can see our President talk a lot about that. At the same time, if we shared the concerns on climate change. We referred on the earnings call to a couple of investments that lower the carbon intensity of our operations. It was wind PPA in the Permian, so we -- our consumer electricity are using renewable electricity there, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the renewable natural gas, which is in California, which takes Methane that otherwise would be vented to the atmosphere processes it, puts it in the grid. I guess we have off-take agreements with trucking company. It generates low carbon fuel standards under the California Regulatory Regime. It's modest capital. It earns an attractive return, so it's something that we believe is good for the environment and good for our shareholders. So we look to do more of that. We'll be very balanced, but \u2013 it's a big question, and we'll be part of the conversation. Jay Johnson : Thanks Pavel. Pavel Molchanov : All right. Appreciate it. Wayne Borduin : Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead. Wayne Borduin : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. And Pierre? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Wayne. We had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. First, an overview of our financial results : Earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.36 per share. The quarter's results included a $430 million special item tax accrual associated with a cash repatriation in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $74 million. Excluding special items and FX gains, earnings were $2.9 billion or $1.55 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio. Importantly, our strong cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.25 billion of shares, in line with our annual share repurchase run rate guidance of $5 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned approximately $9.5 billion in dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date organic CapEx was $14.5 billion, slightly below our ratable budget of $15 billion. Total CapEx, which includes inorganic transactions that are unbudgeted, totaled $15 billion. We are maintaining a firm commitment to capital discipline to improve returns on capital. Turning to slide 4. Third quarter cash flow was strong, down from the prior quarter due to lower Brent prices and the absence of the termination fee received from Anadarko. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of nearly $22 billion funded all four of our financial priorities. With nearly $12 billion in free cash flow, we currently have an annualized yield of about 7%, highlighting our ability to generate strong free cash flow in a lower oil price environment. Through the three quarters, the company's cash flow dividend breakeven price, excluding working capital is in the low 50s Brent. Asset sales proceeds add to our positive cash flow and further lower the breakeven, while high-grading our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $3 billion, and by year-end after the expected closing of the sale of our U.K. North Sea assets, we will be near the low end of our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range with one year to go. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pierre. On slide 7, third quarter oil equivalent production increased 3% compared to a year ago with higher shale and tight production in the Permian as well as higher production from major capital projects following the ramp-ups at Big Foot and Hebron. This growth was partly offset by unplanned downtime at Hibernia, asset sales, and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to slide 8. Third quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the fourth consecutive quarter despite the impact of planned turnarounds and asset sales. Year-to-date production, excluding asset sales, is about 5% higher than 2018, which is consistent with our earlier guidance of 4% to 7% as shown by the middle bar. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Hebron. Turning to slide 9. I'll provide an update on the TCO project. In the third quarter, we completed a detailed cost and schedule review of the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Kazakhstan. As a result, the cost estimate for the project has been updated to $45.2 billion with an additional $1.3 billion in contingency. The expected start-up of FGP has shifted to mid-2023 and will now follow WPMP, which remains on schedule for startup in late 2022. The updated estimate has been submitted by TCO for shareholder approval. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jay. And turning to slide 12, this quarter, there were a number of highlights related to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Earlier this month, we announced two new greenhouse gas reduction goals. The new goals are aimed at reducing our oil emission intensity by 5% to 10%, and our gas emission intensity by 2% to 5% in between the years of 2016 and 2023. These are in addition to the targets we set at the beginning of the year to reduce our flaring intensity and methane emissions over the same time period. In Australia, we started up the Gorgon CO2 injection project in early August and are in the process of ramping it up to full capacity. Once fully operational, this will be one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects and is expected to reduce Gorgon's greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% over the life of the project. Lastly, construction is underway on a new 29-megawatt solar farm, which will supply electricity to Chevron's Lost Hills Field in California. Now looking ahead. In upstream, we expect full year 2019 production growth to be in the middle of the 4% to 7% range, excluding 2019 asset sales. Asset sales, primarily in Denmark and Brazil, are forecasted to have a full year impact near 30,000 barrels per day. Planned turnarounds, primarily in Gorgon and Nigeria, will be lower than the third quarter, but are expected to impact production in the fourth quarter by more than 70,000 barrels per day. As Jay mentioned earlier, we have acquired new exploration acreage in Brazil that is expected to add about $120 million in inorganic capital, which is unbudgeted. Full year TCO co-lending is expected to be below the full year guidance of $2 billion, dependent primarily on the fourth quarter distribution decision. In downstream, we expect high refinery turnaround activity. This includes a refinery-wide turnaround at SPRC in Thailand which occurs once every five years. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make the $430 million tax payment related to the cash repatriation and to repurchase shares of $1.25 billion. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Wayne. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much guys. I guess the first question related to the updated Tengiz budget. Given that a lot of the spending is already behind you, do you anticipate that this is going to have any significant effects on the co-lending that you'll be making to the venture in the coming years? And then maybe I'll just ask my second question now. The U.S. downstream earnings were pretty robust this quarter relative to what I would have expected just given a heavy turnaround schedule. Is it just the margin environment that was helping you out or is there anything else that's happening in downstream that is maybe more ratable? Pierre Breber : All right. Thanks, Jason. This is Pierre. So, on co-lending, we'll provide guidance for 2020 next quarter, as we have in prior years. As you know, co-lending depends on three primary factors : the level of the capital spend, oil prices, the macro environment and any dividends. And I guided in the fourth quarter that we expect the full year for 2019 to be lower than our $2 billion, but it will vary depending on the fourth quarter dividend decision that TCO makes, so if the dividend is higher, the co-lending would be higher. If it's lower, the co-lending would be lower. So, if you go back to how this cost increase impacts co-lending, you really have to look at it as overall cash flow. So, clearly if you hold prices and dividends constant, higher capital costs will result in higher co-lending, but that does not translate to lower Chevron cash, because we're going to offset the increases in TCO elsewhere in our capital program. And so, if you remember, TCO capital spend is non-cash and co-lending turns part of it into cash because we think it's the most economic way to finance our share of the TCO spending. But again we're going to have offsets elsewhere in our capital program, which will be cash CapEx, and that will help offset that higher co-lending. If we go to Downstream in the quarter, we don't -- there's nothing that isn't inherent in the underlying margins that I can really point out to. We've had -- distillate margins have popped up a little bit, and we tend to have some more production in that space. You're seeing some of the effects of IMO are rolling through the system. I mean West Coast margins had some strength at times in the quarter, but I would attribute the third quarter performance largely to how we operated in the underlying margin environment. Jason Gammel : Very clear. Thanks, Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks Jason. Operator : Phil Gresh : Yes, hi good morning. First question, just coming back to the idea that the Tengiz CapEx increase will not affect the overall capital spending plan, is this -- are we just talking here about the fact that perhaps you're at low end of CapEx ranges and now you move to high end of CapEx ranges or how do you calibrate being able to offset $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental spending net to Chevron within the budget? Is it activity elsewhere or is it just within ranges here we're talking about? Thanks. Jay Johnson : Phil, there's a couple of different places that we look to. First, TCO itself in its base capital spend has offset and will continue to offset some of the increase in the FGP spend. Beyond that though as Pierre was talking about, we have a much more flexible capital program now with a lot of short-cycle activity, and we're able to pace and adjust that program to fit within the investment levels that we set, and particularly as it relates to gas-related investments, there are opportunities for us in this current environment to scale back some of that as appropriate, and those are things we may have done anyway. And then the final thing is just the capital efficiency that we're driving throughout the business. Our base business performance has been very strong. We have digital initiatives trying to reduce our -- make our capital spend more effective. And so, right across the board, people are figuring out ways to do more with less. I'll give you a good example was in Bangladesh recently, where instead of making a major capital project to add some additional compression, the team was able to look at recompleting some wells, adding some perforations and doing some debottlenecking on existing facilities, which extended the production plateau and alleviated the need for incremental capital spend on another project. So, it's these types of spending that we constantly are working through as we allocate our capital each year. We're going to remain capital disciplined. We're going to stay within the ranges that we've given you, and we're going to look to do it while we stay focused on delivering the value and returns that are really what's driving our decisions. Pierre Breber : And if I can just build off of Jay's answer there and just to be very specific. No, we do not intend to go from the low end to the high end of the range. We intend to find offsets through the way that Jay has talked about. We have a range because we're giving guidance out to 2023. It is a cyclical business. Oil prices can change, COGS can change. We have short-cycle capital that we can flex up or down, as Jay mentioned. So the intent of the range, we still want to keep the range for what it's there for, and our intent is to offset increase elsewhere. Phil Gresh : Okay, all right. Thank you for that color. And then, I guess, just a follow-up would be for Jay. I'm just trying to kind of rewind here back to a year or so ago, there were some fears that things were getting a bit behind in Tengiz and then back at the Analyst Day, the tone sounded much better that things were back on track. And now that we have a 25% increase, which is fairly sizable. So I'm just hoping you could provide a little bit more color about how these things have progressed to the point that we have this kind of increase? Thank you. Jay Johnson : Yes. I think what's changed fundamentally is we completed a very detailed cost and schedule review in the third quarter. So that's just been completed. And as we looked at it, there were a couple of key elements. We've talked in the past about the overall engineering program, the cost of that program and the impact the engineering has had on fabrication and construction. And you can see those in the first two bars of page 9 -- slide 9. And that really reflects that accelerated consumption of contingency that we've talked about in the past. What was frankly a surprise was the increasing quantities that we're seeing coming out of the late stages of engineering, particularly related to things like the electrical and instrumentation, controls, fire and gas, some of the late changes in how we're going to do the backfill and quantities associated with it. Those drove a much higher construction costs than we had anticipated. And if you look at the third bar, you see that represented. The other big surprise was, having to delay the start-up of FGP by the year. This is really driven fundamentally by an assumption change. We had planned to integrate modules. Our estimate was based on the integration of the modules in FGP, each one taking about 12 months from the time it was placed on its foundation until it's fully integrated. While we're seeing very complete modules come from the fabrication yard, just as we've gotten a year of ME&I experienced this year, our view has changed that we're using 14 months as our planning basis, and that's pushed that schedule time out. So the growth in quantities and the longer schedule have really been the surprises that we didn't anticipate previously. So that's really where we are at this point in time. Phil Gresh : Okay, thanks a lot. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Neil Mehta : Yes, thank you. So the first question just on the Permian and the glide path here. You continue to trend above your target levels. Can you just talk, Jay, with some detail about, how the plan is progressing in the Permian and any comments that you would have on sort of this upcoming U.S. election? And any impacts the way you think about prosecuting your acreage? Jay Johnson : Well, I'll start with just the performance in the Permian. Our view, as you know, has been to be very disciplined and focused on returns and efficiency. And we have seen continued performance improvement in our drilling, in particular. Our completions have remained very strong throughout. And so we're watching every segment of the value chain from the actual land acquisition to fill in some of the checker boards and allow the longer laterals, right through the drilling efficiency, the -- into the completions, the facilities and on production. And then, working with our marketing and transportation group to ensure that we're getting the highest realizations we can for the products that we're producing. So we're on plan. We've actually, as we said, doing very well with our production profile. We're pleased with the performance that we're seeing, but we're always driving for better performance. In terms of the upcoming election, look, hydraulic fracturing has been done for millions of wells, not only in the U.S. but around the world. It's done safely. It's done effectively. We learn more about it all the time. And it's really unlocked an economic -- huge economic benefit for the country, as well as for the companies involved. It's also unlocked some environmental benefits in terms of the proliferation of gas, which isn't always to our benefit from a profit standpoint, but it's a great fuel for the U.S. If you look at it from our company standpoint, we have less than about 10% of our Permian unconventional acreage that is on federal land and all of that is in New Mexico. So from a relative standpoint, while we would not like to see any kind of restrictions on hydraulic fracturing it's -- that's the context for our company. Neil Mehta : No, that's great. Appreciate it. And then, the follow-up here is related to Brazil. There's the upcoming transfer of rights auction and you called out some of your increased exploration acreage there. Can you provide some context in terms of the way that Chevron thinks about Brazil and how aggressive it sees itself being there over the next couple of years? Jay Johnson : Well, we've talked before that we are very happy actually with our existing resource base. We've been doing a lot of portfolio work, as you know, over the last several years to really clean up our portfolio. And part of that has been a reload of our exploration strategy. But because we're happy with our resource base, we have primarily focused on reloading in the exploration space, because we're looking for resource additions out in the future. And we also want to manage our capital over the period of time. So our focus has been on exploration opportunities. That's what you've seen us do in Brazil and our focus has been that way. We are interested in Brazil, because we see the pre-salt as a prolific hydrocarbon basin. It's a good place to be to increase the probability of success on exploration and we'll stay focused on that. We have a couple of wells coming up next year, which will be good wells for us. We're looking forward to seeing those results. But we'll continue to stay focused primarily on exploration, as we look forward. Neil Mehta : Thanks, guys. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Your question, please. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Jay Johnson : Hi. Paul Cheng : Jay, don't want to beat the dead horse on Tengiz, but what have you learned from Tengiz in terms of \u2013 to further fine-tune your development and project execution process? Clearly, there something was not working in order for us that to have at this stage to have the delay for a year and also that for 25% increase. So what have we learned? Jay Johnson : Well, Paul it's a good question. We ask our self all this time -- all the time, how can we do better? Clearly this is a disappointment. I'm very disappointed, because we have taken all the lessons learned from the past and try to make sure we're building those into each project as we go forward. When we think about what's gone well. There have been a lot of dimensions to this particularly the execution work is going very well. I'm happy with the way the fabrication work has gone in the yards. The modules are coming out very complete. And dimensionally accurate and we set them on their foundations everything is lining up. The logistics system has been flawless. The performance is exactly how we had planned and it's delivering modules to the site very effectively and we've been able to complete the sealift for 2019. So we're happy on all those fronts. The schedule delay is a disappointment and that has to do a lot with the quantity growth we saw in engineering. And as we've said, we've been unhappy with the overall engineering performance on this project. Not only the engineering costs themselves, but the impact it's had on fabrication and construction. We need to do better in this area. And it's an area that we're going to continue to learn our lessons from this and build it forward. We don't have any other very large mega projects like this that are land-based anywhere in the world at the current time. So we've got time to take these lessons learned and really think about how we approach this differently in the future. Our commitment remains on capital discipline. Our commitment remains to execute this project to the best of our ability. When you look at the improvements taking place on the ground in Tengiz, in 2018 we talked about productivity that we needed to improve and we saw a 40% to 50% improvement in the productivity across the site. In 2019, this year we've seen another 30% to 40% improvement in productivity. So we're seeing great improvements with the production, the construction management system, production management systems. And we're going to continue to stay focused on productivity, on completing work and moving it to mechanical completion and then getting it through systems completion and then to start-up. Pierre Breber : Yeah. And if I could just build off of Jay's answer Paul. Just to put this in an enterprise perspective, the additional depreciation after tax to Chevron is less than $0.20 per share or less than the cash flow impact of $1 change in oil prices. So as Jay said, we own this and we need to do better. And trust me; we're fighting for every dollar. But I did want to put in perspective what this means for a company like Chevron. Paul Cheng : Sure, I understand. But I think Jay when you're saying that you're unhappy about the engineering on this. So is it not upon the finger, but is it an internal issue, or just an external the contract that you guys use? Jay Johnson : You're asking\u2026 Paul Cheng : How do you -- how are you really going to be able to mitigate it in the future? I mean that -- what -- I mean you say you learned from that, but exactly what have we learned? And what is the change will be? Jay Johnson : From an engineering standpoint, Paul I think we have a couple of things. One, is we are doing more to bring the early engineering back in-house and do more focused design development with our own capabilities. And we're trying to minimize the amount of variation that we see in terms of each project team's decisions that they make around engineering. I think that's a key part of it. And I think looking at the total project in the context of the environment, it's going to be built. It's also important. I do think there are also opportunities for the industry to improve on engineering. I don't think this is necessarily isolated to our company. So there's work to be done as we really understand how to better define and prosecute the engineering programs that are necessary for these projects. Pierre Breber : And if I can just -- what Jay said is we don't have projects like this in our Q. If you look at our capital program, a lot of base business capital, shale and tight capital, we are going to have some major capital projects but the ones that are coming up are deepwater projects, and they're very different than these. A lot of the spending is in drilling and completion, where we're very good on the facility side, it tends to be standard designs in fabrication yards. As Jay said, it's not land-based projects in remote locations, and we have a better track record in those ones. So, again, we need to do better. We're learning from it. From an enterprise perspective, the portfolio, the investments that are at least in front of us are hitting a different place than where this project has been. Paul Cheng : My final question, Jay and Pierre, I think in Tengiz even before the cost increase, the full project return on capital -- the full cycle internal rate of return is actually pretty low. And with this that, of course, is much lower. But the cash flow will be great once that they come onstream. So which is a more important factor when you guys determine whether you want to go with a certain project? Is it the internal way of return, or is the cash flow and the sustainability of that cash flow, say, for how long. So I'm trying to understand that the decision-making process? Pierre Breber : Yes. Look I'll start and maybe Jay will add some comments. I mean, you've heard, Jay and Mike and myself, are all talking about increasing returns on capital. So we are focused on the return on investment. And so we are looking at it. And once you have a cost increase, I think it's stating the obvious that, that dilutes the returns, and we're taking a lot of actions to offset that, both at Tengiz and across the rest of the portfolio. I tried to give, again, some financials that kind of characterize what the impact is, again, on a company like Chevron, less than $0.20 per share. But we are looking fundamentally at returns on capital, but we also know cash is important. It helps pay the dividend and support the share buybacks. Jay Johnson : I would just say this particular project, Paul, I know your views on it have been the same for a long time, but this is an important project for Tengiz, it does lower the back pressure on all the wells and addresses the declining reservoir pressure that we see there. It provides excess gas handling, which will unlock oil production in our existing facilities as well as for FGP and it helps maintain reservoir pressure in the platform, which is an important aspect of the overall performance of Tengiz, not just the incremental performance. There also, as Pierre said, we're looking at ways that this can be offset. And one of the key milestones that was achieved was the decision to debottleneck the CPC pipeline. And so that's going to open up some additional export capacity, which will improve realizations and help boost returns and help mitigate and offset some of the increases that we're seeing on project cost. Paul Cheng : Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Devin McDermott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jay Johnson : Good morning, Devin. Devin McDermott : I wanted to follow-up on some of the exploration discussion from earlier. You talked a little bit about Brazil, but you also highlighted in the release and slides, some additional blocks in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, and I think you've been fairly active in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico leasing as well. As we're going to step back and look at where you're seeing the most opportunity from here, can you talk a little bit more about that and the overall strategy here and the desire, if any, to diversified growth options away from shale and tight, but I think you mentioned there were some larger capital projects offshore potentially in the pipe? So a little more color on that would be great. Jay Johnson : Yes. Thanks for the question. So in addition to Deepwater Brazil, we have been very interested in some of the deepwater in the Mexican areas of the Gulf of Mexico. And this plays on a lot of the knowledge we already have in the U.S. sector of the Gulf of Mexico. So we've recently farmed into some additional blocks and these complement nicely some blocks we'd acquired in an earlier bid round. One of our strategies has been to move out of more of the frontier highly-speculative areas and really focus our exploration initiatives in the areas that we consider to be highly-prolific basins and that really increases our probability of success. At the same time, we're doing that, we're trying to balance the amount of capital that what goes in early and really use the fact that some of this is only under 2D seismic or lightly explored to open up new opportunities for development. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we've been very active. And one of the key strategies in the U.S. Gulf is to focus a lot of our new blocks around existing infrastructure and we're looking to push that envelope of how far we can tie back exploration opportunities or discoveries to existing infrastructure and avoid having to build brand-new greenfield. A couple of examples of that would be, for example, you recently heard about the Esox discovery with another operator, that will tie back to Tubular Bells. It's very close. It brings new production in at very low capital cost and with a very short-cycle time. So those are kind of the low-cost high-return subsea tiebacks that are being enabled and supported by our exploration strategy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We're also talking about extending that reach, as I said, through some of the new technology. We have used quite successfully the single phase pit floor pumping at Jack and St. Malo and really proven that technology, and we've now finished the technical certification to move to multi-phase pumping and this can really extend that radius, of which we can pull production back to existing hosts that have ullage. So it's entirely in line with our theme of exploring in prolific basins, but also utilizing existing infrastructure and getting more out of our existing facilities whenever possible. Devin McDermott : Got it. Great. And my second is on some of the comments around incremental efficiencies you're realizing across the portfolio, is one of the things you mentioned in response to the Tengiz's cost pressure. And Pierre, I think you mentioned it also as an area where we've seen success across the portfolio in your prepared remarks. So I was hoping to get a bit more specifics on where within the portfolio you're seeing these capital efficiency improvements. And then also, to the extent you are cutting back capital in more gassy areas in response to the Tengiz's pressure? Any additional detail on where that is, in North America, gas elsewhere in the portfolio. Additional color would be helpful there as well. Jay Johnson : Sure. The increased efficiencies, quite honestly, are happening across the board. All of our units are really focused on how to continue to drive better performance out of the investments we've made in the past. We've seen some great improvements in particular, for example, in Angola, where they have developed some new opportunities by using our existing installed base. We saw a very strong cash flow coming out of Angola, and there's been a lot of good cooperative work with the government of Angola to unlock many of the marginal reserves that can be tied back to our existing facilities. But it really is happening around the world. In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, we've seen our unit development cost come down to where we're now targeting $16 to $20 a barrel for new facilities and projects like Anchor and Whale, certainly we're targeting in that range. The OpEx in the Gulf of Mexico and the deepwater has come down to just under $10 a barrel, which is a significant reduction from where we were in 2014. We're taking these lessons learned, we're sharing them across other areas in the company to make sure that it's one thing to share, it's another to adopt these best practices, but we're seeing great cooperation between our business units and we're going to be really focused on doing that even more as we move forward. All of this isn't just in response to Tengiz. But rather it's the context of Tengiz in this environment that's allowing us to do this and I think do it quite efficiently. In terms of the specifics on where in our capital program we'll be making changes. That's not something that we'll discuss at this point in time, but we'll give more color on that potentially in December with our capital announcement and of course in the SAM, the Security Analyst Meeting that we do early in the year each year. Devin McDermott : Understood. Thank you. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question please. Biraj Borkhataria : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry, I have another one on Tengiz. Jay, you mentioned the significant productivity improvements in 2018, 2019 but taking that on board that would suggest the CapEx increase was coming quite a long time ago. So I guess just want to square that comment with the CapEx increase today and the timing of that. But taking a step back, you look at the last few years and you've had your fair share of issues at some of these major projects. Pierre, you're signing off on these. I just wonder if these experiences make you think twice about embarking on these types of projects of this scale in the future? That would be my first question. Then I've got another follow-up. Thanks. Jay Johnson : So on the productivity the contracts at site at Tengiz and the construction are largely unit rates. So we pay based on the quantities that are being installed. But the productivity is important, because it relates to the underlying schedule and the ability to finish the work and execute the work in the time frame that we've got. And with the numbers of people we planned, because there's a lot of indirects that come with having to add additional direct labor. So while the unit rates have been in place, it's really the complexity that has increased on some of the manhours. We've talked in the past about the unit rate costs that were in our bids for the mechanical electrical and instrumentation work. But really the surprise has been the increase in quantities, because when you multiply the quantities times those rates that's what's resulting in the higher cost. And as I said the shift in schedule. So that's how I square that with what we've given you in the past and really what came out of the detailed cost and schedule review that we just completed. Pierre Breber : Yeah. And Biraj in terms of -- I think I addressed this. I mean, we don't have other projects like STP WPMP in our queue. Kitimat is being worked but it's not ready. What we have is a lot of base business capital, a lot of shale and tight and hopefully some deepwater projects here over time. So I understand your question, it's theoretical. I'm not going to speculate about it. But as I look at our portfolio right now we don't have that choice. That said, we're going to be in the business a long time. We're going to learn from it. We have to do better, but we don't have any immediate capital decisions that are in this large scale land based construction project. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay, understood. Just to follow-up, hopefully, an easier question, but the tax on repatriated cash, are you expecting that to be a one-off, or is it -- should we expect more of these in the future? Can you confirm whether that was cash tax or just a P&L charge? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Yes. So thanks for that question. So, no, we completed a global cash management review in the third quarter and decided to repatriate this cash, which was previously unremitted. So prior to completing this review, these earnings were expected to be invested outside the U.S., and that's why we didn't accrue for the state and forward withholding taxes. So when we made the decision to repatriate it, that's when we accrue the tax. So it is a cash tax, but the cash -- the tax payment will be in the fourth quarter. We accrued the P&L was in the third quarter. And the actual cash movements, so this will bring non-U.S. cash into the U.S. It will allow us to lower our cash balances, will lower our debt balances. We're doing it because it's the right economic decision. And this is for prior earnings. We do not expect other types of repatriations of prior earnings like this. At the same time, there could be some current earnings that, of course, are repatriated, and that's in the normal course of business. So, no, this is a one-off. It's over $8 billion of non-U.S. cash being brought to the U.S. You won't see our U.S. cash balances go down by that full amount because some of it had been lent into the U.S., but we expect our year-end cash balances to be $3 billion to $4 billion lower than where we ended the third quarter. We ended the third quarter a little bit high because we were preparing for some of these moves to repatriate the cash. Biraj Borkhataria : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thanks, everybody. Jay, I know you don't or maybe, Pierre, I know you guys don't normally want to talk about fiscal terms, but in light of the Tengiz's cost increases. I just wondered if you could just remind us or walk us through what the implications are for cost recovery, because I'm guessing that with existing production and like of ring-fencing and so on, the net impact of this may not be as severe as, obviously, the headline cost overrun suggested. I just wonder if you could walk us through what the cost recovery ramifications are please? And I've got a follow-up. Jay Johnson : Well, this is a tax and royalty contract in Tengiz. And so it's really going to be through the DD&A and the way that flows through the books in terms of the recovery. So it's impacting returns more than it will the actual cash flow once we get past the start-up of the facility. Doug Leggate : I was under the impression it was going to accelerate the DD&A, is that not the case? Jay Johnson : As I said, we're not going to discuss the terms of the contract, but it's a tax and royalty contract and... Pierre Breber : And just to be clear, when I refer to the less than $0.20, I'm talking about booked DD&A, booked depreciation, not tax depreciation, which obviously is different. Doug Leggate : Okay. No, I'm sorry I thought it was an accelerated piece to that. Thanks. My follow-up is really more going back to the Permian. Obviously, the plan you've laid out is continuing to -- you continue to outperform against at least the production profile. But when you laid out the plan, you talked about when you would expect the Permian to be cash breakeven in terms of capital and cash flow and obviously, royalty contribution and so on. Obviously, NGL and gas prices have deteriorated quite materially. So I'm wondering if you could just update your thoughts on that. And specifically, on the takeaway solutions that you've announced over the last several months. What does that do to your ability to improve gas and NGL realizations of those lease line? Or are they going to uplift your realizations with more to work in the Gulf Coast type metric to? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Jay Johnson : Well, we went through a lot of this, Doug, as you know in the second quarter call and that guidance still stands. In terms of the crude takeaway capacity, we have sufficient capacity, not just to produce it into the basin, but to take it to Houston and now we have export capacity opening up as well, 35% now and 40% in 2020. So that's the crude side of things. NGLs are sufficient through 2020. And in terms of gas, our primary focus was to make sure we have evacuation capacity in the basin and we have 100% of that covered. Our view and our practice is that we have no routine flaring of gas to enable production. And we've been able to honor that. In terms of moving gas out of the basin, right now, we have about 25% capacity and it's going to vary based on how these different pipelines come on stream, but by the second quarter of 2021 we're expecting to have about 80% of our gas flowing out of the basin. We are still expecting to have free cash flow positive next year. Doug Leggate : Jay, just to be clear, this is \u2013 is the 60%, 65% gas in NGLs? Or can you \u2013 I know you talk about liquids, but can you split the oil versus NGL portion then I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Jay Johnson : We see -- roughly half of our total mix is in crude, about a-quarter of it is in gas liquids and about a-quarter of it's in natural gas. Doug Leggate : Helpful. Thanks a lot. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Doug. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please. Dan Boyd : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to actually follow-up again on the TCO spend. And if I recall correctly last year you spent about $600 million more than you initially budgeted. So what I'm wondering is how much of the sort of overrun is going to be already spent or in the budget by the end of this year? That's sort of the first question. And then, the follow-up is, when I look at your total CapEx budget, in order to be below the $20 billion for next year, given that affiliate spending will still stay high. Are you implying that your cash CapEx could potentially be down next year? And I'm just wondering if there's a potential production impact of that or if the Permian is running ahead of schedule enough to offset any of that. Jay Johnson : So a couple things, Dan. First of all, I'd take you to slide 10 and that kind of shows our production or our spending profile for the FGP project. And we see 2018 and 2019 as our peak years of spend. And as we look to 2020, we'll start spending at a lower rate as we move and consolidate really the activities largely into site construction work. We have one more year of fabrication to go in one of the four original yards. And that work is currently about 73% complete. In terms of how to allocate the incremental spend over the total project, I would say, roughly it's about half of it behind us, half of it -- about $4 billion to $5 billion in front of us. But as we look at it, it's really in that increased construction costs where we see the majority of the increase and the surprise. The part that we did in the first engineer -- or the engineering and fabrication was more directed around the consumption of contingency. The increases we've really seen have been in construction and schedule. Pierre Breber : So Dan again just to build off Jay's comments. I mean, we're coming off of reaffirmed the guidance for next year between $18 billion to $20 billion. TCO will be coming off as Jay said. And so we have -- we're doing -- we're finalizing our plan and our capital program right now. But we have -- between the efficiencies that Jay talked about and choices we can make around deferring low return projects, we absolutely have the capability of landing a capital program in that range. Dan Boyd : Okay. And the production outlook more than offset that in other areas? Pierre Breber : Yeah, I mean we haven't given production guidance year-by-year. We've given the 3% to 4% production outlook to 2023, so no change to that. Again some of the examples, some of the offsets do not impact production. Clearly if we defer some lower return natural gas investments or we decide to flex down some of our shorter cycle spend that could have a modest impact on production, but there are other things that are going better like the Permian and other offsets that we're trying to manage. So we will give our \u2013 usual one-year outlook on production guidance on the fourth quarter call in late January. Dan Boyd : Okay. Thanks, Jay. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : Good morning. Thank you. I guess, maybe it's been mentioned a couple of different times, the weakness in gas, maybe as you think about global gas markets, LNG, what you're seeing in terms of any additional risk we should think about on the spot market side or on the contracted side for LNG? And then there's a little add-on to that, just an update of how Gorgon and Wheatstone are performing here in planned and unplanned maintenance? Jay Johnson : Okay. Gorgon and Wheatstone are actually performing quite well. Gorgon Train 1 is currently under a scheduled turnaround or planned turnaround. But as you saw our third quarter production and there's a slide in the back was very strong out of both Gorgon and Wheatstone and we continue to stay focused on enhancing the reliability and the utilization of those facilities as well as creeping the capacity. We have a turnaround schedule that is going to be planned for both of those and it'll be an annual event. Those will be -- we'll talk about those as we get closer to them. We have another train for Gorgon next year that has been announced. And these will be done to allow us to get into a regular rotation of turnaround, so they can be done safely and efficiently just as we do in our downstream facilities and places like Tengiz. We do see the potential for spot to be higher as we increase production, as we hit stronger production, we will have more cargoes available for spot. That's a good thing, because we actually have more production than we'd planned for. But over time as the reliability continues to strengthen, we would expect to try and term up some of that anticipated spot cargoes and reduce the amount of spot in any given quarter relative to either long-term or medium-term contracts that we've put in place. Pierre Breber : Yeah. The only thing to add and Jay mentioned this in the second quarter, we have seen some customers downward flex on the long-term contracts. This is something that is within contractual limits and within the contractual terms. They have to do it almost a year ahead. It's tied to Annual delivery schedule, but we have seen some of that, and that has resulted in a little bit more in the spot market than we otherwise would have. Roger Read : And any particular weakness in the spot markets that you're seeing at this point, or are we pretty well past that for the summer time? Pierre Breber : In terms of calling -- and look, it looks -- the macro on spot LNG looks sort of structurally oversupplied. Of course, a cold winter can certainly fix a fair amount of that, but storage levels in Europe, our full Asia seems to be well positioned. So if I look at it right now, again, it looks oversupply and there's more LNG coming on. But markets surprised us all the time. I mean, the takeaway for us is we are just not really exposed to the spot market. We are primarily selling under oil-linked, long-term contracts. Thanks, Roger. Roger Read : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Sam Margolin : Hello. Pierre Breber : Hey, Sam. Sam Margolin : So my first question is on the Permian, and it's probably for Jay. I think it's well-understood that your leading-edge wells perform better and better. I'm interested as the base gets bigger and is more important to the overall production targets, how your first-generation wells look if your EURs, that you projected, look like they're intact or growing or changing in any way? And if there's sort of rigless activity work workover stuff that you have to do that you had modeled or maybe it's less than what you modeled, but just any update on kind of your older wells and how that component of the Permian is shaping up today would be great. Jay Johnson : That's a good question, Sam. Thank you. When we look at our production performance out of our wells, the early horizontal wells have actually performed as we expected them to perform. And so our EURs have been consistent with expectation for the wells as we move through. As we have continued to evolve, though, our basis of design and our completion strategies, we've seen higher and higher EURs and the new wells, of course, are meeting those expectations as well. So overall, the program is working as planned. The newer wells, as you point out, are much more productive than some of the older wells, but they're all meeting the expectations that we've set for them at the time in the aggregate. Obviously, any individual well may be higher or lower than planned. But as a portfolio, as a program, we've been overall pleased with the performance. And that's really what's underpinning our ability to deliver the production profile you can see on the chart in the appendix. Sam Margolin : Okay, thanks so much. And then just a follow-up, Pierre, you get this question all the time about the leverage profile on the balance sheet, but the net debt continues to fall. The ratio of your free cash flow annualized and not a great year to net debt is like 1.5 times. Is there a level of net debt that you think is under-levered or suboptimal for the business, especially in the context of Tengiz? If the biggest impact is a return impairment, you can enhance that to the equity with some leverage deployed somehow, so just your thoughts on how net debt's trending and what optimal leverage is? Pierre Breber : Yes. No, thanks, Sam. Look, yes, we are generating good cash in a challenging macro environment. I think you know our four financial priorities. I will go them quickly. The first is to sustain and grow the dividend and we increased it 6% later this year. The second is the reinvest capital in the business and you heard Jay reaffirm our capital guidance. So we are not going to add to our capital program. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet and that's what you're asking, I'll get to that. And the fourth is our buyback program that we intend to sustain through the cycle and we have that at a $5 billion annual rate. So what happens in the short term, clearly, if we generate more cash than those three requirements : in particular the dividend, which we increased earlier this year; the capital program, which we're holding flat and the buyback program. Then it goes to the balance sheet. That's where it's going to go in the short term, that's just that's just how the math works, but over time, we expect if those conditions continue without speculating about future dividend increases or share buybacks, over time that cash should be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends, and a sustained buyback program, because as you say, we don't need to be an even stronger credit. We have the leading balance sheet in the industry. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. And I've talked about a gross debt to capital ratio of 20% to 25%, we're well below that, I'm comfortable being below that, because that's again the outcome of our cash generation profile, depending on where the macro environment. Obviously, that can change, but we are very well positioned to grow dividends sustain the buyback invest in the business and maintain a strong balance sheet. Sam Margolin : Thanks so much. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Sam. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Your question, please. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to firstly quickly confirm that 2019 CapEx hasn't changed as a result of the TCO overspend. And then, secondly, just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A. That hasn't been addressed this call. I think in the past, you've discussed wanting to kind of expand or potentially acquire some company that operates in multiple arenas, not just one that operates in U.S. shale. I'm wondering, if that's still the way you're thinking about M&A and how the opportunity set looks right now. Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yeah. Thanks, Jason. On your first question on capital for this year, our capital budget on an organic basis is $20 billion. Year-to-date, we're at $14.5 billion, so we're basically on track. We've had some modest in organic capital year-to-date, that's been the Pasadena refinery primarily, and we guided to a little bit for the Brazil exploration bit around. So, again, we're on track for delivering an organic capital program in line with our budget of $20 billion. In terms of M&A, I'm not going to speculate on that. I think you've heard us talk about it. Look, we have a very strong value proposition. We have a 4% dividend yield, a 2% share buyback or the buyback equivalent to 2% of the shares, a free cash flow yield a 7%, an advantage portfolio that Jay has been talking about, with strong resources and reserves that allow us to grow cash flow and grow production over time. So we don't need to do a deal. All that said, at times in the past we have been opportunistic when we think it's in the interest of our shareholders, it is difficult to make M&A work for our shareholders. And right now, we think we have a very good value proposition on our own for our shareholders. Thanks, Jason appreciate the question. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. Wayne Borduin : Okay. Jonathan. Operator : Yes. And I\u2019d like to hand it back to you for any further remarks. Wayne Borduin : Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready \u2013 now, that's the end of the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead. Wayne Borduin : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Mike Wirth : All right. Thanks, Wayne. Last March I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment, focused on four elements that differentiate Chevron from its competitors; an advantaged portfolio; a resilience to price downside; the commitment to capital discipline; and a superior capacity to return cash to shareholders. And as we've done in the past, we delivered again in 2019. We generated over $27 billion in cash flow from operations. We executed our $20 billion capital program. We grew annual production to a record high. We continued to high-grade our portfolio and we further strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet. As a result, earlier this week, we increased the dividend by more than 8%, and we expect to sustain the increased share buyback rate of $5 billion per year going forward. And we did this despite the cost increase at TCO and the fourth quarter impairments, which Pierre will cover in just a minute. 2019 performance delivered on all four of our financial priorities, which I'll cover on the next slide. These priorities don't change. They've been the same for a long time. For two years in a row, we simultaneously increased our dividend, increased share repurchases, grew production and reduced debt. Not everyone can say this. You can see the sources and uses of cash on the slide, including the $13 billion returned to shareholders, nearly the same amount as our cash CapEx. 2019 was a good year and we intend to do even better. During our Analyst Day in March, we'll lay out our plans to further improve performance in order to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierre, who will discuss our 2019 financial results. Pierre? Pierre Breber : Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter results included a net $9.2 billion charge in special items and a foreign exchange loss of $256 million. Excluding special items and FX, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.49 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. This is lower than the prior quarter in part due to higher taxes on repatriated cash, including the cash impact for the $430 million tax charge that was accrued in the third quarter. Total capital spending was $21 billion. This includes around $800 million of inorganic spend, which we don't budget primarily relating to the purchase of the Pasadena refinery and acquisition costs for exploration leases and additional working interest in El Trapial. Mike Wirth : Okay. Thanks, Pierre. On Slide 11, we are maintaining our commitment to capital discipline. And in 2020 our capital budget will be flat for the third consecutive year. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget of $20 billion, which includes more than $6 billion in expenditures by affiliates primarily TCO, CPChem and GS Caltex. In the 2020 budget, approximately $5 billion is allocated to our upstream base business, $4 billion to FGP/WPMP, another $4 billion to Permian development, $3 billion for downstream and chemicals and the remainder goes to other MCPs exploration and other projects. Chevron's capital program is unlike our peers. Our spend profile has low execution risk and is focused primarily on short cycle, high return investments that are expected to sustain and grow the enterprise for many years to come. Slide 12 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2020 asset sales. Our projected growth is largely driven by the Permian, partially offset by ordinary base declines and the effects of prior year asset sales. The range reflects key areas of uncertainty in our business as noted on the slide. After another year of record production in 2019, we expect a fourth consecutive year of production growth excluding the impact of potential 2020 asset sales. Wayne Borduin : Thanks Mike. I'd like to remind everyone that we have our annual Security Analyst Meeting in New York in early March, where we will share more about our business performance, long-term strategies and five-year outlook. We're looking forward to seeing you there. For those not attending in person, it will also be available via live webcast. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : The first question and this might be one for you, Pierre, is cash flow in the quarter earnings looked good, cash flow a little light. It did seem like there were some one timers in there. So can you just spend some time talking about what some of those one-time items are and how should we think about that rolling off as we go into the next quarter? Pierre Breber : Yes, thanks, Neil. So cash flow was a little light perhaps. In the third quarter, we did provide guidance that we expected to pay the taxes on the repatriated cash. So if you recall in the third quarter, we accrued in our P&L for that tax effect on repatriating cash, but the cash taxes weren\u2019t actually paid until the fourth quarter, when in fact, you saw the cash move. So you saw cash balances go down from over $10 billion to less than $6 billion at year-end. And then the second item I would cite for was lower affiliate dividends. So we have lower dividends from our Chemicals affiliates, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, and no TCO dividend in 2019. So at times in years past TCO - we received a dividend from TCO in the fourth quarter and we didn\u2019t have that last year. Neil Mehta : And the follow up is just on production guidance. Up to 3% in their number of variables that you called out there, but can you kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020. What are some of the pluses and minuses that we should be focused on. And how should we think about - thinking about some of the timing of those elements recognizing that you\u2019re solving for - value over volumes? Mike Wirth : Yes, Neil I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019ve had, as I mentioned, three years of production growth of 7% I think two years ago, 4.5% last year, 5.5% without asset sales. We continue to be on a good, strong program in our upstream that\u2019s delivering volume growth. And as we said, up to 3% this year. The Permian is the biggest piece of that, and you can see over the course of 2019, what we delivered. And - what I would call full factory production mode right now in the Permian. And so, that machine continues to click along very well. Jay will talk more about that, including not only kind of the near-term view but lay out I think a little bit of a longer-term view for you in March. We\u2019ve got contributions from other shale and tight, where we continue to invest in both Canada and Argentina. And those are beginning to contribute, not at the same magnitude as the Permian, but certainly strong growth Gorgon and Wheatstone through improved reliability and addressing constraints and optimization within the LNG plants. So we\u2019ve got growth coming across a number of those.  And as you note there, we\u2019ve got some uncertainties on the PZ . It looks as if we will begin production there here at some point over the next few months. There\u2019s still some details being worked out on that, but that starts to come back in. Hard to say how things go in Venezuela really difficult to say right now. And then, the other one of course, is - non-operated joint ventures and we certainly have some expectations for activity there. How that trends with funding levels decisions by partners, et cetera. A little hard to predict, but look, we\u2019re going to, we expect to grow production again this year. As I said, setting aside if we do anything else with asset sales in the portfolio. And, fundamentally, the underlying drivers that we laid out last March, where we said a 3% to 4% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. Those drivers remain intact. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please? Phil Gresh : The first question here - some of your peers seem to be signaling a return trend in buybacks, need to protect balance sheets. Obviously, you\u2019ve talked about the strength of your balance sheet and willingness to continue the $5 billion buyback here in 2020 despite the big increase in the dividend earlier this week. So, as you look at that I mean, is there any reasonable scenario where you would think it would not make sense to do the buyback from a macro perspective. Mike Wirth : Yes Phil, it\u2019s Mike. No change in our expectations there. We\u2019ve indicated we increased the buyback last year. If you look at our cash flow, you can see that we certainly can afford this, as Pierre mentioned. Debt came down again last year, and we have the capacity to see this through cycles, which is what our intent is and no change to that guidance at all. Pierre Breber : Yes, and if I can just build off that and address Neil\u2019s question on fourth quarter cash flow, but if you look at full year cash flow, it was very strong. Again, we paid a higher 6% dividend per share in 2019 covered that. We fully funded our capital program and grew production as Mike said over 4%. We paid down more than $7 billion of debt. And in 2019, we bought back $4 billion of share. So, we\u2019re exiting the year confident in our ability to generate future cash. That was expressed with the 8.4% dividend increase and, again, this expectation of sustaining the buyback through the cycle. Phil Gresh : Mike, second question just to follow-up, would be it sounds like you\u2019ve been doubling down here on cost reduction efforts, and it\u2019s been a big focus for you recently. So it would be helpful if you could talk about what\u2019s been happening lately on that front. Do you see this as something that would be material to investors in terms of Chevron\u2019s ability to reduce costs in the upstream and/or downstream businesses in a way that we could see? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yes, Phil so I may sound like a broken record on this, but in a capital intensive business, capital discipline always matters. And in a commodity business, cost discipline always matters. We\u2019ve done a good job in taking costs out of our business over the last several years in response to the downturn we saw earlier last decade. You can never assume that you\u2019re done, when it comes to seeking efficiency and driving to an even more efficient cost structure. And so that is certainly my expectation as we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to do that. We\u2019ve taken cost out at the same time production has grown significantly over the last number of years. And so unit costs have come down dramatically and my expectation is we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to reduce both absolute costs and unit costs over time. In March, we\u2019ll lay out a little more specifically what some of our ambitions are on this, and the kinds of things you can expect to see. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please? Jason Gammel : Yes thanks very much, gentlemen another solid year in terms of execution in the Permian. I was hoping that you could address whether you still see the Permian as on target for being able to be essentially free cash flow positive. The capital budget picked up a small amount for 2020, and I know commodity prices have some influence there. But if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing? Mike Wirth : Yes, Jason, the short answer to that is yes, we do. We fully expect to be cash flow positive in the Permian this year. We exited the fourth quarter with very strong production, if you look at the growth Q3 to Q4. And across all the metrics, we continue to see improved performance. We\u2019re getting more feet drilled per rig every year, lateral lengths are increasing, EURs continue to go up, development costs continue to come down. And we are becoming more efficient from both a capital and an operating cost standpoint. You put all that together with the royalty barrels and the benefit of the fee acreage that we hold, and the picture in the Permian looks as strong as it ever has. I mean, it just gets better. Jason Gammel : And then just as a follow-up, and this may be something that you prefer to largely defer to March, but a lot of your European peers are putting a fairly significant amount of capital into businesses that they call low carbon, which generally look to be relatively low rate of return type of investments. Can you talk about within Chevron how you think about lowering the overall carbon footprint of your portfolio? And whether these are the types of investments that make sense for you? Mike Wirth : So let me start with lowering our carbon footprint and then I\u2019ll come to investments, Jason. We absolutely are committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Last year, we announced two metrics tied to methane emissions in flaring that are driving significant changes in what we do. We have adopted two additional metrics which I expect to also be included in compensation related to carbon intensity of oil production and gas production. We are doing a lot of work around marginal abatement cost curves across our entire portfolio to look at the intersection of technology, investment and opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint. We\u2019re integrating renewables into our business in a much greater way with green power purchase agreements, feeding biofeedstocks in our refineries as soon as this year, and codeveloping renewable natural gas projects with dairy farmers, for instance. And then the final thing is, we are investing in technologies, looking for things that can scale up, that can provide solutions to these challenges. And this includes not only things like carbon capture from ambient air, but other things to try to decarbonize the more difficult sectors where energy intensity is high. Last thing I'll say is, just to remind you that we operate the largest on purpose carbon capture and storage project on the planet at Gorgon. And we have two of the trains running right now. The third will start up this year. That will, at full capacity, be sequestering 3.5 million to 4 million tons per year. So we're absolutely committed to finding ways to address the climate issue. When it comes to investments, it can be challenging because the returns, as you say, historically, have not been competitive with some of the other things that we invest in our portfolio. We're looking for ways to improve that and find things that we can invest in that would offer attractive returns for investors, also be good for the environment and, importantly, can scale. And this is a big challenge and we need things that we can do at scale. And so we continue to be committed to that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your question please. Jeanine Wai : I think just following up on that question. Last month, Mike, you were quoted by saying that companies wait until changes forced upon them fail. And we were just wondering, are those comments specifically related to the gas write-downs and Chevron's longer-term view on natural gas versus liquids? Or was it more broadly speaking to Chevron's strategy related to the LNG transition or else just something else? Mike Wirth : Probably the final. The something else. And it really is, we need to continue to adapt and our Company has been around for more than 140 years. And we have reinvented ourselves many times over that period of time. We live in a world today with 7.5 billion people. 20 years from now, there will be more than 9 billion people on the planet. There's an expectation for a reduction in the impact of what we do. And at the same time, we need to support affordable, reliable, access to energy for a growing population and growing standard of living. Now we also have technology tools that are available today that we've never seen before. And so what we need to do is continue to evolve our culture, our applications of technology, our cost structure, our competitiveness and our discipline to be part of that equation for many, many decades into the future. And so my comments really are a message to our employees that we need to change. We need to evolve and it addresses all of the things that we've talked about. It addresses a more efficient and lower carbon intensity in our operations, but also calls for us to find ways to adopt new technologies and change the way we work in response to them. Jeanine Wai : My second question is on the Gulf of Mexico and potential upside to medium-term growth there, especially post 2023. So with tiebacks to existing infrastructure there being very attractive from a rate of return perspective in the portfolio. Can you talk about any technology that you're working on that could potentially extend high back ranges? And then any update you might have on estimated resource that we can be excited about in terms of exploiting through existing facilities or infrastructure, given the continued focus on free cash flow? Mike Wirth : Yes. So we've sanctioned projects at the end of the year, which is a greenfield project with Anchor at a much lower cost structure, both capital cost and operating cost than we've seen before. So I think when we find projects where that's the right answer, you'll continue to see us do that. And we've got a lot of exploration acreage out there and a good track record over time on exploration. But the concept of tiebacks, I think, is one that we need to continue to invest more in. We had a discovery last year with Hess as the operator called Esox, a low-cost, high return tieback, which actually will turn a 2019 discovery into 2020 first oil. It's about five miles away from tubular bells. We've been working on technology to extend subsea tiebacks and this includes longer distance pumping of fluids, compression and movement of liquids and the ability to avoid formation of hydrates and other things on the sea floor, pushing the range of tiebacks from the neighborhood of 30 miles out closer to 50 miles, and that really expands the opportunity set for us to use existing infrastructure to improve production. We're working on multi-phase subsea pumps and a number of these technologies. And so I think as we go forward, what you will see is an increased blend of tiebacks and use of existing infrastructure as well as the occasional large greenfield project that comes in. And things like Anchor, for instance, you've got an initial phase of development. And once that's in, that enables what we just - what I just described, which is these additional follow-on phases of development, which are much more economic. And I think technology just moves in one direction, and it really builds on my prior comments that we need to look for ways to use technology standardization and other approaches to make the deepwater even more economic, a lot of progress has been made on that, and I'm optimistic we'll see more in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Roger Read : Guess, if we could, I've got kind of one that's maybe on the risk side question and one that's on the upside question. So with the good news first. You highlighted some of the things at a risk to 2020 production. But recent talk has been about restarting the neutral zone, you have a position there. And then I was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020? I mean, should we be thinking Permian? Or should we focus on some other portion of the operations? Mike Wirth : So on the partition zone after several years of being shut down, there's been progress with an agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. That memorandum of understanding has now been ratified by the Royal Court in the Kingdom and the parliament in Kuwait, and we're moving on to some administrative actions required to implement that. All of that suggests that we should resume work in the PZ this year. It's been shut in since May of 2015. And so we will be careful to ensure that any startup and resumption of activity is safe that we really focus on equipment integrity. And so it will be a careful restart and a gradual ramp. And so I think in terms of production this year, we're likely to see a start-up at some point and then some work before we begin a gradual ramp. So what that nets to is not a lot of impact this year. But if - it could be some positive upside. I think we'll see more of the ramp completed in 2021. We eventually will have to get some new rigs in there to begin drilling additional wells. And so, but it should be on a trend line over the next 18 months or so back towards something that looks like we saw before we shut down. In terms of other upside, the Permian has kind of continually surprised us to the upside, even as we raised expectations in the past. And so certainly, that is a possibility. I mentioned the other shale and tight and those also continue to really show strong improvement in terms of performance. And so I think those are some other areas where you could see production upside. Roger Read : And then for my bucket of cold water on you. We've seen global natural gas prices take quite a hit, obviously, fairly mild winter across. Northern hemisphere hasn't helped. But part of it is your own LNG facilities and everyone else continues to run better than expected? Are we seeing some start to run above nameplate capacity. And so as we think about gas in 2020, what - do you feel that if we look at North American forward curves, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the year ahead? Or is there a reason for optimism in one place or greater pessimism in another. Just sort of curious how that would fit into your outlook. Mike Wirth : Overall, Roger, I think the market is, as you say, pretty tempered on gas pricing. And we have had a relatively mild winter, both in North America and in Asia. And forward markets reflect that inventory levels reflect that. We're not banking on a recovery in gas prices. We've got an under - we're underweight gas as a percentage of our portfolio versus others. And I'll remind you, we've got pretty good term contracting on our LNG with oil-linked pricing across a lot of our portfolio there. So from a relative weighting standpoint, we may not be quite as exposed. So maybe it was a bucket of cool water rather than ice water that you dumped on me there. But yeah, the markets are setting up, I think, to be pretty flattish. And that's why we've got to focus on self-help and things like cost, as I discussed earlier. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please. Doug Terreson : Mike, so in integrated oil, returns on capital have converged between the companies during the past decade or so, which suggests that competitive advantages may be converging, too. And on this point, while you guys had this mantra of disciplined, return-driven capital allocation and that's clearly the appropriate approach, at least in my view. My question is whether you think that historical advantages and project management, multinational experience, logical superiority, cost of capital, maybe leaving something out are still strong and defendable for Chevron. And if so, are there examples that underscore the strength of the advantages that you guys have. And on the other hand, are there areas of historical competitive advantage that you sense are being eroded and where you'll need to redeploy capital away from in the future. Mike Wirth : Well, there's a lot in there, Doug. Number one, you're right. I think we have seen this convergence of returns in part by the last cycle we came through in high prices. We had a high cost structure. We had lot of investment across the industry, and we are now living in a world of more abundant supply and prices and returns reflect that with the capital sitting on the books of everybody. I do believe the advantages that have historically been associated with the companies like ours are still strong, and the project at Tengiz, while we wish that the execution was going better than it is and disappointed in the cost and schedule update, there are not many companies in the world that can do a project like that at all and so I think there are strong advantages there. Our sour gas handling capabilities, our heavy oil expertise continues to be of value, and as we get back to work in the PZ, we will be doing things there that very few other companies can do. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve been hanging in, in Venezuela, which has tremendous potential and our capability there to help over time develop that resource in a responsible way is something that is differentiated. So I think there\u2019s some historic capabilities that are differentiators. The other thing I would point to is portfolio, and certainly as we\u2019ve talked about many times, want belabor it, but our position in the Permian both from a size standpoint, a quality standpoint, the lack of relative lack of royalty given the fact that it\u2019s fee acreage and our experience with factory drilling, which is a capability that not everybody has, and we continue to see the benefits of that year after year, is another point of differentiation. So I still do believe there are areas that we do differentiate. A \u2013 Pierre Breber : And if I could build off Mike\u2019s answer there, look, we get, and I said in my prepared remarks, that our returns are too low and we\u2019re committed to improving them and we\u2019ll share more at our Analyst Day. But I\u2019ll also talk about cash flow. We talked about our strong cash flow in 2019 and call it whichever macro environment you want to call it weak or whatever but we\u2019re able to do all those things, increase the dividend, fund the capital program, grow production, reduce debt and sustain the buyback program. At our last Analyst Day we showed that over the next five years we\u2019re going to grow cash from ops. We said we\u2019re going to keep capital essentially flat. That means we\u2019re going to grow free cash flow and so I think one of the things that\u2019s not fully understood is that the capital efficiency of our program going forward is different than we\u2019ve seen in the past. So we\u2019re able to grow and sustain cash flows at lower capital than almost any time in the past and certainly better than our peers. And that\u2019s what enables us to do the kind of dividend increase that we announced a couple days ago, sustain a buyback program and still grow the enterprise for the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your question, please. Paul Cheng : My idea. You did an impairment charge, which is quite large and obviously that means the decision made at the time some of the parameters did not work out. So what have we learned from this process, or this impairment and how your future M&A or project accession, the process has changed? Mike Wirth : Yes, Paul, two of the big drivers of that charge were our Marcellus position, which is essentially mostly dry gas. We\u2019ve got a little bit of Utica but mostly dry gas, and also the Kitimat LNG project which is Canadian gas that is quite a ways away from the Kitimat site. And both of those, at the time those transactions were entered into, we and the world had a different view on natural gas. I think the Permian and unconventionals have really been a game-changer. You look at the prolific gas production in the United States today, the market conditions that we were talking about earlier with Roger, and we didn\u2019t see those things at the time. And so I do think there\u2019s a lesson about testing M&A ideas against scenarios that are not the then-prevailing view on forward markets. We did that with the Anadarko transaction last year, and there\u2019s a reason that we \u2013 we like Anadarko from a synergy standpoint. There\u2019s a reason we saw a certain value level that we would be willing to transact at and there\u2019s a reason we wouldn\u2019t go beyond that. And that\u2019s because commodity markets are hard to predict, and we certainly looked at cases that would have stressed an acquisition because we might experience a different market environment than the one that we premised maybe our central analysis on. And so Yogi Berra said predictions \u2013 I think it\u2019s Yogi Berra predictions are hard, especially when they\u2019re about the future. That\u2019s certainly true. It\u2019s not lost on us, and I would say that\u2019s the big lesson from these two is if you\u2019re going into the future with \u2013 or into a deal with a pretty strong view on commodity price, make sure you take a look at what happens if you\u2019re wrong and whether or not you\u2019ll be happy with it in the scenario where you are wrong. Paul Cheng : On the second question, I think Pierre already addressed someone, I mean return on capital employed. Last year, you earned 7% at a $64 Brent price, which is lower than the SMP market return, I think. And that for most of the investors, they probably think $60, $65 Brent is as much as they\u2019re willing to give companies into long-term assumption. So you\u2019re talking about a improvement. Can you give us some idea that where \u2013 given the big portfolio you have, I mean, where that you see the biggest opportunity you may be able to really drive up that return. I mean, we\u2019re looking at some of the project, whether it is Tengiz, the Future Growth Project or the Anchor; we don\u2019t see those projects would be able to improve your overall return at all. Mike Wirth : Yes, Paul, look there\u2019s no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment. You roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things that cumulatively can drive returns higher. And that\u2019s costs, that\u2019s margins, that\u2019s value chain optimization, it\u2019s reliability, it\u2019s technology. There\u2019s a whole host of levers that you have to be working on. This is what we do in the downstream business every day and what we\u2019ve done in the downstream business for decades is you assume margins are going to be worse in the future than they are today, and you\u2019ve got to find a way to get more efficient and productive with your operations in every little thing that you do. And that\u2019s what we need to do. I\u2019m not satisfied with returns at the level that they are. We\u2019re not going to wait for prices to be the answer here. We simply have to \u2013 we have to get after it, and you\u2019ll hear more about this in March. We\u2019ll talk more about our plans to improve returns then, but there\u2019s not a magic wand here. This is good old-fashioned hard work, and it\u2019s things that we know how to do; we just have to get after it. A \u2013 Pierre Breber : Yes, let me just add in addition to the cost and margin and value chain and all those efforts, the Permian investments are very accretive to our book returns. We showed in the second quarter that even in a growing asset, and we are investing and growing in the Permian that returns are heading to 20% and north of that. So we do have investments that are accretive to the portfolio. I just said earlier, we have some really capital efficiency that enables us to sustain and grow the enterprise at lower capital levels than we have in the past. So when you take the capital efficiency plus all everything Mike talked about, we intend to increase our returns over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question, please? Jason Gabelman : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess this follows what Paul just said. Specifically on Anchor, it seemed like CapEx for the project was a bit high. And I was wondering if you could talk about returns. You\u2019ve kind of danced around it, but maybe talk about returns specifically for that project. And is that kind of one of the more competitive projects in your project queue, and I have a follow-up. Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yes, Jason. If I go back to an earlier period of time, our development costs for deepwater projects were north of $30 a barrel. Anchor is actually south of $20 a barrel. And that includes some investment for new technology that we have to prove out here because we\u2019re dealing with deeper reservoir, higher reservoir pressures \u2013 so 20,000 pounds technology. A little bit of additional export pipeline, which is unique to this project as well. Operating costs have come down from the high teens per barrel down into the range close to $10 a barrel. So we\u2019ve seen significant improvements in drilling and completions performance. And all of those things come together to bring the cost down. I\u2019m not going to give you a specific return number, because frankly, we run these things at different prices and different assumptions around recovery. So we look at a range of potential outcomes. But I will tell you, it is competitive in our portfolio. It sets us up for additional follow-on development that will, I think, improve returns. And the technology development unlocks a resource type that we believe holds a lot of potential as we go forward. And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done in terms of driving these costs down. And in the deepwater, we\u2019re going to continue to look to make these projects even more economic. Jason Gabelman : When you say unlock a new resource type, is it kind of a high pressure, high temperature, more further? Yeah Mike Wirth : Correct. Jason Gabelman : And then there\u2019s not a lot of visibility to your project queue beyond 2025. There\u2019s a couple of Gulf of Mexico projects per Permian and TCO, and that\u2019s kind of all you\u2019ve given us. I wonder if you plan on providing more visibility to some of your projects that you have options around. And then kind of attached to that, do you see an opportunity to step into some international projects, maybe with companies that are looking to farm down stakes? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yes, so we will in March lay out a longer view to give you some more transparency. I know that\u2019s a question that a number of people have been asking. The one thing that I would suggest is we went through a period of time over the last decade where I think we conditioned ourselves and our investors to believe that the only path to the future was by doing these great big projects and stacking up lots and lots of them, because that\u2019s what we were doing at the time. We have a very different portfolio today. We have large traunches of production that are pretty flat and facility-limited in Australia LNG and Kazakhstan. Our unconventionals begin to behave this way as you build up the scale there.  And so at the margin, we continue to look for the right projects and highly-economic projects as it appears that those that are accretive to returns. But we\u2019re not nearly as reliant on those alone to sustain and grow cashflows into the future. We just have a much more resilient, durable, long-lived portfolio. And so grinding away on enormous unconventional positions may not be quite as glamorous as doing the big projects in terms of giving you a lot of things to talk about, but it really drives strong financial outcomes. And it\u2019s durable, I think, longer than most people believe. And so we\u2019ll talk about that more in March. We\u2019ll talk about other opportunities we have in terms of captured opportunities that people may not be paying much attention to. We\u2019ll talk more about our exploration prospects. And the question on farm-ins, that\u2019s always something we evaluate, and if the right opportunities present themselves, we look at those. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question, please? Biraj Borkhataria : The first one is actually just on the base decline. If I look at the figures on slide 8 and take the base from there, it looks like the base decline was less than 1% in 2019. And I guess that excludes shales, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether that figure is relevant and if there\u2019s anything funny in the 2019 number that is not applicable going forward. Just some comments around that would be helpful. Mike Wirth : I mean, our base portfolio was large and there\u2019s a lot of different assets in there. There are some things that now are in the base that are things like Jack/St. Malo and Perdito, and so we\u2019ve got some of these deepwater projects that are all on our new projects. Some of the new investments in there to do next phases of development and the like give you some growth that offsets some of the underlying decline, but it also comes back to this point I was just making to Jason, and a larger percent of our portfolio now is facility limited, not reservoir limited, and so this mental model that reservoir dynamics drive our overall production, the shape of our production profile is one I think that needs to be calibrated appropriately to a larger and larger portion that does not behave that way. So that results in more stable, predictable production. There\u2019s modest investment required to sustain that, be it facility investment or some new wells. But you look at that, you look at the brownfield opportunities we have, and the ways we\u2019re using technology to arrest declines, and base decline is just less in our portfolio than it was a decade ago, and that\u2019s not a short-term phenomenon. That\u2019s a structural change in how our production looks. Biraj Borkhataria : That\u2019s helpful. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Biraj. Do you have a follow up? Biraj Borkhataria : Yes, the second question is just on a slightly different tact, but as you guys sit in California, I wanted to ask about renewable fuels, given the favorable regulation there. So what we\u2019re seeing is a number of the U.S. refiners announce expansion projects in renewable diesel in particular. I was wondering if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. What do you think about the economics? And then, if it\u2019s attractive to you, what\u2019s holding you back from investing in that space? Mike Wirth : Well, we\u2019ve been selling renewable fuels in California for the better part of the last two decades. A lot of blending. We\u2019ve been looking at manufacturing, but we really have chosen not to go into the ethanol business. On renewable diesel, we\u2019ve got close relationships with suppliers of renewable diesel, and we are, I mentioned earlier in a response to a question, we are making modifications at California refining facilities in order to co-feed biofeedstocks in order to produce renewable diesel. So our view is rather than going into new projects and greenfield developments, we\u2019ve got existing infrastructure and kit that we have now proven the way to safely and reliably introduce biofeedstocks and co-feed. So it\u2019s a more economic way to do it. It takes advantage of existing capital investment, and so we\u2019re working on that. So we are and will continue to be growing in the biofuels value chain. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Mike and the guys, happy New Year to all of you. Mike, I wonder if I could just hit we\u2019ve had some concerns about this particular issue for a second, and it\u2019s the Permian. I\u2019d like to just get your perspective on it. I realize what you\u2019re saying about returns and the benefit of royalty interests and mineral interests and so on, but by 2023, this is going to be 25% of the company, and when I think about the underlying decline rates and the skew towards NGLs and gas given the state of the U.S. gas market, help me understand why the increase of the putting not much of your portfolio on high decline assets and skewing toward U.S. gas is incrementally positive for the overall cash flow capacity of the company. Mike Wirth : Doug, so look, an individual well is a high decline asset. The Permian Basin, as you add hundreds and then thousands of wells on production and you have infrastructure built, the ability to keep that infrastructure full and have it be a very flat production profile at modest incremental investment relative to the production that you\u2019re producing is profound. Jay will explain this more in March when we come to New York, but it is a factory, and running a factory, you\u2019ve got certain costs and certain investments in the factory and then you push out the product or the factory, and that\u2019s how to think about the Permian. The commodity mix, look, it\u2019s 75% liquids. We\u2019re 50% oil in our portfolio right now, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. As the volumes continue to grow, we get a lot of oil production and we take a long view on markets. Pierre mentioned earlier that returns on investment there are greater than 20% and growing. And so look, if we\u2019ve got something that somebody mentioned earlier your current returns are 7%, those need to improve. Well if you\u2019ve got opportunities to invest in things that are north of 20 that\u2019s a way to start to lever up returns. And so look, we look at the commodity prices on it all, we optimize it. We\u2019re moving commodities to markets near and far to add value to that but these are high return, long lived positions and it is a competitive advantage. Doug Leggate : I look forward to what Jay has to say in March but just to be clear, those returns are full cycle including infrastructure and all of the plant build out and so on? Mike Wirth : And fully loaded with costs including corporate costs. Doug Leggate : My follow up, Mike, is more philosophical I guess for the broader energy space. All we all seem to be, it seems like there\u2019s been a kind of an awakening if you like to ESG issues just in this last past six months and particularly this year. More headlines this morning about pension funds just divesting out of fossil fuels altogether. I\u2019m just curious how in your position obviously as an advocate of the industry, how do you anticipate challenging those kind of questions over fossil fuels, everything else good kind of thing? How does Chevron compete for the incremental investment dollar? And it\u2019s an answer I\u2019m looking for some help with because obviously it\u2019s a challenge role for all of us in this business right now. Mike Wirth : Yes, well first of all we believe in ESG. We have been a responsible operator across ES&G for a long, long, long time and we invest enormously in that. The E is getting a lot of attention right now and look, over the history of our industry, we have, we and others have reduced the environmental impact of our operations time and time and time again. We are doing it again today, and we have the scale, the technical capability, the financial capability, to be a big part of addressing this challenge. And no one country, no one industry is going to be the one that solves everything, but collectively, we will respond to the challenge. The world needs more energy. The world needs more affordable energy and people in developing economies deserve the opportunity to see their lives improve and affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to improving the quality of life on the planet, which is better today than it has ever been at any point in history, and will be better in the future. And we intend to be a part of that solution. We acknowledge that the climate is changing. We acknowledge that human activity and fossil fuels contribute to that. And we acknowledge that we will be part of addressing that as we go forward. And so we are investing time, people, money, technology in being part of that solution. And look, I\u2019m an optimist. There\u2019s a lot of pessimism that you can hear out there. And as you say over maybe the last six months that drumbeat is even louder. But we\u2019ve solved big challenges in the past, and I\u2019m optimistic that we will be successful again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citibank. Your question please. Alastair Syme : With the impairment, I guess you\u2019re signaling something about LNG. So the question is are you happy to tack away completely from LNG? I mean, you\u2019ve been one of the biggest global investors in the last decade and clearly created a lot of competency within the organization. So are you happy to do nothing in effect? Mike Wirth : No, we\u2019re happy to do things that are competitive and economic, Alastair. And look, we\u2019re a big player in LNG. The demand for LNG will grow over time and you have to take a long view on these things. Commodity markets get into positions where they get over built, demand grows in linear fashion, supply comes on in stair steps. And so we\u2019re in a position right now where the near-term market fundamentals are a bit tough but long-term, like petrochemicals, like refining, you need to be in low-cost positions that are highly competitive where you\u2019ve got scale, technology, operating efficiency. And so those are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking for and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to add to our LNG portfolio. Our assessment on the Kitimat project is, given all the other investments out there in the world that, that one was going to be tough to compete versus our alternatives. And so it\u2019s a hard decision to come to, but it doesn\u2019t condemn the asset class for us as an investment proposition. We just want to find the very best projects. Alastair Syme : My follow-on, I just wanted to get an update on where you\u2019re at in TCO; specifically, any discussions you\u2019re having with the government. I\u2019m not sure where the government\u2019s been sort of informed on the cost overruns and where that leaves it? Mike Wirth : Yes, so the discussions are ongoing. The government\u2019s obviously key stakeholder in this, and so our people in-country have been engaged. Jay Johnson will be there next week, and both visiting the site and meeting with people from the government. And so when you go through one of these things, there\u2019s a whole series of engagements and we\u2019re in the process on that. Pierre Breber : Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that, Alastair, is that unlike other agreements in Kazakhstan, our contract\u2019s tax and royalty, right. It\u2019s not a production-sharing contract. So in production-sharing contracts, the government reimburses the concessionaires for their cost which is not the case for tax and royalty. So of course, they\u2019re an important stakeholder but it is a fundamentally different contractual structure. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar from Tudor Pickering. Your question, please? Jamaal Dardar : Just wanted to touch on the outsize dividend growth that we saw versus previous years here. So just curious on the thought process there. And as you continue to shed assets and large MCPs roll-off and capital intensity is lowered, just wondering how repeatable outsize dividend growth could be over the long-term? Mike Wirth : So if you look back at our dividend history \u2013 and we were looking back at it not long ago \u2013 whether you\u2019re looking over multiple decades or over the last decade, we\u2019ve grown at kind of a compound annual growth rate of about 6%. And so this is a little bit to the upside of that, but we\u2019ve been lower than that here in recent years and we\u2019re well positioned. Pierre talked about our strong cash flow and the capital efficiency that we have now in our portfolio to sustain and grow cash flows with a much lower level of capital investment than I think people have become accustomed to over the prior-period. We would not have increased the dividend if we weren\u2019t absolutely confident that it\u2019s sustainable in perpetuity. And just as we said, we intend to sustain our buybacks through the cycle. We intend to sustain strong dividend distributions. Our number one financial priority, I\u2019ll remind you, is to sustain and grow the dividend. And so this was a signal of confidence in our portfolio. It\u2019s a signal of confidence that we can sustain strong cash generation, even in a commodity price environment like the one we\u2019ve been in and the one we continue to be in. And we will talk about this more in March, but we have a very, very strong position to generate cash out of our portfolio, very efficient capital profile going forward, further efficiencies coming on the cost side, and we\u2019re very confident in the capacity that we have. Decisions are made by the board. I can\u2019t get ahead of the board on what they may do in the future. But I\u2019ll tell you, the board shares the confidence we have in our cash generating capacity. Jamaal Dardar : And then just a quick one on the buybacks. You mentioned the sustainable nature. It\u2019s difficult for us to model the impact of the PSC roll-off, but it seems very temporarily there could be at strip pricing, time periods where in order to satisfy the full buyback, maybe you lean into the balance sheet there. Just wanted to verify the comfort there; obviously, given where you sit as best of class on your debt ratio? Mike Wirth : Yes, thanks, Jamaal. No - yes, if we have to lean on the balance sheet for some point in time, that\u2019s okay, right? We\u2019ve said we want to sustain it through-the-cycle. We\u2019ve never said the buyback has to be funded every single quarter from free cash flow. So that\u2019s not our expectation. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Our net-debt ratio is 13%; gross debt is 16%. We have the capability to take on some debt. I\u2019ve talked about we don\u2019t have a target debt range. But certainly, I\u2019d be comfortable higher than we are right now. But if we\u2019re outside of, if we\u2019re a little bit low, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s how the math works. So if we generate cash at surplus to our top three priorities, which is to pay the dividend, invest in the business, and have a strong balance sheet. And we\u2019ll return that in the form of share buybacks. But we also want to keep that ratable and sustainable, so we just don\u2019t want to ramp-up buybacks because we want to be able to essentially dollar cost average and do it through the cycle. So the short answer is yes. There will be times we\u2019ll lean on our balance sheet. Our balance sheet has that capability. And our intent is to sustain the buyback through the cycle. Mike Wirth : Thank, Jamaal. Well, with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone\u2019s participation on today\u2019s call. Jonathan, back to you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I wound now turn the conference call over to your host for today\u2019s program, the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead. Wayne Borduin : Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other Forward-Looking Statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Alright. Thanks, Wayne. Before we get started, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Our thoughts are with all the families affected by COVID-19 and especially with the healthcare workers on the frontlines battling everyday to contain the outbreak. I\u2019m also incredibly grateful to our employees who show up every day, particularly those out in the field, operating critical facilities to provide the energy that supports the pandemic response and keeps essential goods and services flowing in support of the economy. They too, are heroes. During our security analysts meeting in March, we discussed Chevron\u2019s resilience. And now it is time for us to demonstrate it. No one foresaw these specific market conditions, but we were prepared for them. We know what to do, and we are doing it as we execute this five point action plan. First and foremost, we are focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Next, we are exercising the flexibility in our capital program. Today, we are further lowering our full-year guidance. In addition to capital costs always matter in a commodity business. We initiated a major company restructuring last year, and we expect to drive additional savings this year and next. Capital structure also matters. We came into this crisis with an industry leading balance sheet, and we are taking actions intended to maintain financial strength. Lastly, while addressing current market conditions, we are preserving long-term value for shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. I will speak to each element of this action plan in the following slides beginning with safe and reliable operations on Slide 4. We have had fewer than 50 confirmed cases of employees with the virus and nearly all cases appear to have been contracted outside the workplace. Most of our office based employees are able to work-from-home. For those who continue working at facilities or in the field, we have implemented multi-layer screening, distancing, hygiene and PPE protocols. Our COVID-19 testing capability is ramping up. Finally, we are helping our communities with donations of money, PPE and other things we can manufacture like sanitizers in our plants and 3D printed face shields. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. Turning to Slide 10. First quarter earnings were $3.6 billion, or $1.93 per share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes special items in foreign exchange were $2.4 billion, or $1.29 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion and total capital spending was $4.4 billion. In the quarter, we also increased our dividend and repurchased $1.75 billion of shares, before suspending the share repurchase program. Turning into cash flow. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations covered the dividend and cash CapEx and the first quarter, yielding a dividend breakeven under $50 brand. Proceeds from the sales of our interest in Malampaya were offset by loans to TCL. Given volatile market conditions, we are holding more cash and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 14%. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. Operator : Certainly. . Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Phil Gresh : So first question here just as we look at that slide really talking about the $30 oil case. And the funding of the dividend, the priority of the dividend and adding debt to cover capital spending. At the end of that period, do you have a sense of\u2026 Michael Wirth : Phil, you cut out, right. When you said at the end of that period, do you have a sense of. Operator : Mr. Gresh, we are not hearing you right now. I\u2019m not sure if it is your connection your phone. Michael Wirth : Okay. Jonathan, we can move on to the next question. If he go back and if we can clarify that we got a good connection with him. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Devin McDermott : I wasn\u2019t on mute, but there, but it seems like it wasn\u2019t going through it. If you hear me now with the, I will try to pick up where I think Phil left of on the stress test for $30 Brent. When we think about where this the stress test takes you from a leverage standpoint, or debt to capital standpoint over that two-year period. He talked a little bit about where you would end up at the end of 2021 And also where you would comfortable in terms of taking leverage to and what\u2026 Michael Wirth : Yes, we I think we got the essence of it, which is where do you end up at the end of 2021 and how comfortable are you there as Pierre Breber do you want to respond to that? Pierre Breber : Yes. So, thanks for the question. Look, the chart on the left gives an indication of the negative cash flow that we expect under a stress test at $30 Brent, and then the chart on the right shows our debt position relative to peers and relative to the zero line which has a net debt ratio of 25%. And when you put the two together, where the negative cash flow or that incremental debt, it keeps us - we are still to the right of that zero line. So, in other words, we can have two years at $30 Brent, invest in the business, sustain our dividend and still exit at the end of 2021 with a net debt ratio less than 25%, which we think is still a very strong balance sheet. Michael Wirth : Yes, I might just add Devin. We are protecting the dividends because we are set up to do so and we have made it a priority. As Pierre said, we enter with balance sheet strength that is second to none, and advantaged portfolio with a low breakeven capital discipline. That is part of our DNA. We have demonstrated it through the way we have managed capital spending, our discipline on transactions and we have got capital flexibility. And all of this is because we are committed to the dividend and you can see that while we do lean on the balance sheet to fund the capital program, over this period of time, we can support the dividend comfortably and still remain in a very healthy position and we have set ourselves up to do so. Thanks, Devin, did you have a follow-up? Devin McDermott : Yes. So, a follow-up just on the on the capital spending side building down a little bit. So, you talked a little bit about how you think about the tradeoff between some of the near-term cuts in capital spending, which really skewed more towards short cycle versus one of your priorities of retaining long-term optionality and continue to support longer term growth. So, that preservation of long-term value point. So, how do you think about that trade off and also how much additional flexibility if any is there as you look at the budget where it stands today? Michael Wirth : Yes, Devin. So, a few years ago, we really had a budget that was skewed towards the long-term, end of the spectrum, and we have consciously shifted that now to have the short-term weighting much higher within our portfolio, because it gives us the flexibility that you talked about and it is underpinned with the longer term projects, but it is not dominated by those. So, we have built a more flexible portfolio that allows us to slow down the short cycle investments when the market signal indicates that those are not being rewarded in the marketplace and yet we are maintaining the ability to ramp those up. And we have a longer term capital projects that are earlier in the phase and we will be very disciplined in bringing those forward. The other thing that is different that is really important is a much larger percentage of our portfolio now is facility limited, versus reservoir limited and characterized by the kinds of declines that you can see in a different portfolio. And that enables us to hold production with more modest capital spend and preserve the cash flow that is associated with that. So, look, we are conscious of things like leases, we are conscious of the way we are developing our resources, but we are trading those things off and when the market is not calling for near-term production, we shouldn\u2019t be investing to deliver it. We should be conserving the cash for another day and that is really how we are balancing this out. Thanks Devin. Devin McDermott : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Your question please. Michael Wirth : Doug, were still challenged here with this audio situation. I\u2019m afraid we are not hearing you. I apologize for this. Jonathan, can we try to\u2026 Pierre Breber : Yes, Jonathan, why don\u2019t we pivot to the next question? The next in the queue. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Neil Mehta : Alright. Well, thank you. So I guess the first question was around curtailments. And can you walk us through with a little more depth about where they are magnitude? And as we think about production shut-ins, what gives us confidence that there won\u2019t be any structural damage to the assets and we have confidence that supply can return when the market ultimately needs it? Michael Wirth : Sure. And so let me just frame it up a little bit, Neil. I was just talking to Devin about balancing cash flow and long-term value and that is certainly a key driver here as we are looking at curtailments. We are trying to avoid the need for abrupt shut ins. So these truly are in broadly speaking curtailments rather than the shut ins, with a very conscious effort to preserve reservoir and well integrity. We do these things for turnarounds for storms and the like. So we know how to do this quite well. And we really don\u2019t expect any issues as we ramp backup. Curtailments in April were relatively modest, as Pierre outlined with the forward guidance May in June look like they could be more significant. About 50/50 between the U.S. and rest of the world. And certainly in the U.S. the Permian and the short cycle piece of it is the predominant part. Around the rest of the world they tends to be related to OPEC and OPEC Plus commitments in the way those are translating into local conditions. But we are very cognizant of where and how we slow production and expect to be able to return production when the market changes in relatively short order without putting reservoir well integrity at risk. Neil Mehta : We see that you put a pause on the project or at least slow down spending. So, can we do a status check of how far you have gotten so far, and how it is progressing? What the ultimate plan is around execution from here, and in any early thoughts on what that slowdown could mean for the full project budget? Michael Wirth : Sure. So the project is about 75% complete right now Neil, construction 56 or so percent. Logistics are working very well, as I said, there are only seven modules left in Korea and all of those will have departed by the end of this quarter. We have got a number on the water, additional ones at the transshipment locations and some moving through the waterways. So the logistics are moving quite well. Since late 2019, we have got all of the pipe racks and the gas turbine generators and utility modules on foundation and we continue to work on the critical path. Locally, I mentioned we have seen COVID cases in a number of the camps, there is over 100 different residential camps there. And as a result, we are de mobilizing non-essential staff to minimize the risk of spread. That means we are de mobilizing about 17,000 people to 20 different locations. Most of these are contractors, not employees of TCO. But we are helping to manage the logistics. We are moving people back to other parts of Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Singapore, the UK. We need to provide context tracing information for everybody who demobilizes, we have converted a fire station and a - test center. We are testing 1,500 people a day. We have got 29 nurses there working around the clock. So a very thoughtful effort on how we demobilize. The people that are remaining are working, in essence under a pod strategy where workforce is isolated by shift and by crew. We have got boxed meals, digital permits. We have got dedicated drivers and cleaners and things to really reduce the risk employees are all outfitted in proper PPE and alike. We actually are maintaining pretty good schedule progress on the critical path, in spite of all of this, which allows us to focus the workforce on critical path. And to demobilize, some of the non-critical path activity. Our power and control work, the gathering system, the sour gas injection system are all several months ahead of the critical path. And that enables us to slow down and mitigate some of these risks. The biggest challenges are in the area of crew changes. So we have people working on some extended rotations, transit in and out in the labyrinth of travel restrictions of each level cities, countries, et cetera is something we are managing aggressively and carefully. We are testing people as they arrive to minimize quarantine on arrival. So a very focus and thus far, I would say a very successful effort to respond to this. The main focus is on the pressure boost facility and the utilities in the processing plant, which are on the critical path. In terms of the actual reduction in C&E, our share a about a billion dollars, about half of that is deferral of activity. About a third of that is mitigation of cost growth through aggressive creative measures. And the balance is really related to foreign exchange. So hopefully that gives you a sense of where we are, and certainly, as we go forward on every call, we will know more, we will see how things have unfolded there, and we will provide you additional information as we have it. Pierre Breber : Thanks Neil. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your question please. Jeanine Wai : So, my first question now that you can hear me is on sustaining CapEx. And we know, Mike, that you don\u2019t really talk about sustaining CapEx on a one year basis at all. But can you comment on whether the new 12 billion annualized CapEx run rate is enough to maintain what you would consider acceptable reserve replacement ratio over a longer term period and whether this can also allow you to achieve your corporate objectives of increasing RSE, shareholder returns and all that, but maybe at a different rate from what you thought before? Michael Wirth : Yes, Jeanine, you are correct. This really isn\u2019t a way that we think about the business, it is not something we rely on or plan around to measure the business. So, it is not an simple question to answer, because it is just not how we think about things. We do understand it is a question among some in the investment community, Pierre has been thinking about how to try to help you guys understand this a little bit better and translate from how we run the business to how these questions come in. So Pierre, maybe you can help Jeanine with that. Pierre Breber : Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. And as Mike says, we don\u2019t think about the business that way and to the earlier question. We are not sustaining short-term production, right that is a very deliberate choice. Mike talked about that the price signal says we don\u2019t need a short-term production, and we are prioritizing capital on long-term value. So, again if sustaining short-term production is part of the definition, then it is just not how we manage the business as we are trying to balance the short-term and the long-term. But if we think of sustaining capital as kind of an analytical construct, that is really the capital to keep upstream production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years, and so in that definition, I would exclude exploration, I would exclude capital to develop new fields or for expansions like into in 10 GIS, I would exclude assets that are sold or contracts that are going to expire and I would exclude downstream and chemicals. And so if you if you go through that, and we talked about 11 billion for upstream based business and shale and tight total capital, and that results in some growth, about 10 billion would be a reasonable estimate of the capital to keep that production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years. Again, we are below that right now. Right, we started with bass and shale and tied at 11. If you roll through the reductions will be under eight. So, again, short-term production we do not expect to be sustained at your kind of notional $12 billion capital which includes downstream and chemicals with some cuts and exploration, but long-term value is preserved. Thanks Jeanine. Michael Wirth : Did you have a follow up Jeanine? Pierre Breber : No. Michael Wirth : Okay, fine. Next question. Operator : Alright. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your question please. Michael Wirth : We will be patient here, because it seems like it takes 15 or 20 seconds for this to start. So Paul, hang in there and we are waiting on you. Paul Cheng : I think since that potentially that we will cut off, so I would ask both questions. I think the first one Mike, not that you will have a target now, but that the sector is being compressed and a lot of your peers is under distress. If there is a one view, how much is the balance sheet you are willing to risk in this current moment for the right deal at all?  And the second question, may as well that ask that first, in case I get cut off. This is for Pierre. You have a strong balance sheet, but it looks like you are going to have a substantial cash burn for this year, next year, and three depressed pricing in the moment that we see. You raise some debt, but you make sense for you, given the debt market has actually open and the cost is quite low for you at this point to raise even more debt to pre-fund the potential cash burn or that you think the commercial market is with available and you don\u2019t need to do that? Michael Wirth : Okay, yes, Paul, you are an experienced multi part questioner. So I think that was good to get both of those in. Let me let me give you a quick response and then Pierre, I\u2019m sure will have some thoughts he would like to add there. The reason we showed this low prices stress test Paul was to give you a sense that we really can endure a couple of years of really tough pricing, and our gearing would move back to a level that is not an uncomfortable level to be at. In fact, Pierre said frequently, that overtime we would anticipate moving our gearing back into the kind of 20% to 25% range. Anyway, now this isn\u2019t necessarily the way we thought we would get there. But that is not an uncomfortable place for us to be. So leaning on the balance sheet through this period of time is something that is very doable that will maintain a strong credit rating as we do that. And so we are certainly willing to go there. And as you know, in years gone by you go back a few years ago, our gearing was above that 25%. And so I think we are in a range that we have demonstrated, we can manage, and we know how to. In terms of going to debt markets at low cost, I do think that it is prudent to look at that. And debt is attractively priced right now, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for us to look to add to that. So Pierre, maybe you can comment on that. Pierre Breber : Yes, I think there was an M&A question to there about using our balance sheet for M&A. But that I think I can just address. You can also use equity as part of a transaction, so we don\u2019t view the balance sheet as the only means to do M&A, because equity makes sense in an oil deal where there is price risk and obviously price volatility and you wouldn\u2019t want a winner and loser between the buyer and the seller on an M&A deal. In terms of, I think Mike address the debt question. I mean, as we consume cash, we will lengthen the maturities, we will look at when there is a good window to approach the bond markets. We do have access to a lot of commercial paper that was shown on the liquidity side. Commercial paper still remains, the lowest cost and the most flexible source of funding for us, but under these kinds of conditions, and if the conditions persist, we would want to have some more longer term debt that would be appropriate. And I think as Mike said, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you see us approach the market. Michael Wirth : Thanks Paul. I\u2019m sorry, I missed the M&A angle on your first question. Okay, let us go to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please. Pierre Breber : Hang in there, Paul, for some reason, we are still working through the delay. Paul, we are ready for your question. Paul Sankey : Hello, can you hear me? Michael Wirth : Yes. We have got you, Paul. Paul Sankey : The question is, how is the world changed for you post this thing? Obviously, we can see the future strippers is pressured for 2021. And I think you have addressed that a little bit. I think it is clear that your mega projects Australia, Kazakhstan sort of continue as they were, and ultimately have very low breakevens when they are running. I guess the question would be, firstly on the Gulf of Mexico is the world do you think different there. And most importantly, obviously, for your Company, we know that you wanted to buy Anadarko for the acreage in the Permian. How do you think that the world has changed with regards to the Permian given what is happening? Thank you. Michael Wirth : Okay. thank you Paul. Well, I think when you are in the depth of something as unprecedented as this. It is hard to say exactly how the world will change on the other side of it. And as much as it feels like this has been going on for a long time. We are really just a couple of months into it. And so I think on the other side of it, I\u2019m an optimist. I have great confidence with all the resources being dedicated to vaccine development and therapeutics and testing capacity. I\u2019m an optimist that in time the health risks will be successfully mitigated and managed. I believe that the world will return to some post Corona Virus form of normal and that means economic activity. It means growth, it means travel. The pace and the patterns at which that reemerge is I think are still open to a wide range of views and I don\u2019t know that anybody can predict that exactly. But when you translate that back to our industry, I think it plays into some things that we have long believes, which is low cost of supply matters. Operational excellence and discipline in project execution matters, capital, discipline matters, cost, discipline matters. And all of those things will become very apparent as we recover in some form with inventory length in the market with OPEC production off and with the opportunity for shale and tight to come back in relatively rapidly. And so I think, the term lower for longer has been used for a while to describe conditions. I think that is even more appropriate today than it has been in past times when it is been used. I think we need to be very focused on an efficient use of every one of our resources to operate well and to drive the cost of supplies down in a world that looks like it will be pretty well supplied. So, you get to the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico has been resetting its cost structure to compete in a world like this. I think it means we have got more work to do to make the Gulf of Mexico compete even more, more focus on tiebacks, infill drilling, utilizing existing infrastructure and finding efficient ways to develop in the Gulf of Mexico and so that trend is one that we need to stay on. We have made a lot of progress and I think there is more work to be done there. In the Permian, our we are not done improving in the Permian. Our results, even as we sit here today, continue to improve and so well costs come down, drilling efficiency improves, completion, design and execution improves, and the hydrocarbons haven\u2019t gone away the rocks don\u2019t go bankrupt, and companies might but the rocks won\u2019t. And I think that that is a resource that will continue to be very important in the overall supply picture and certainly, it will be for our company. And so we will look to invest in the very best projects, we will look to acquire assets and opportunities, be they through exploration or other means that will compete in our portfolio and continue to be attractive in a world where low cost of supply and the ability to generate good returns matters. So, in some ways, those fundamentals are only more important going forward than they have been Paul and beyond that. I think it is speculation on a lot of the other things you hear people talking about. Pierre Breber : Okay, so we are going to pull an audible here. I have actually got Doug Leggett\u2019s questions keyed up, he had trouble dialing back in, so he texted me his questions, Mike. I\u2019m going to feed them to you that way. So, the first one was for Mike shale thinks the whole industry needs a reset a change in long term supply et cetera. They just cut the dividend to adapt. What do you think of the big picture at this point? And then the second one will be for Pierre. Michael Wirth : Okay, look, I think everybody is - it is interesting, Doug and apologies we couldn\u2019t get you on the phone directly here. I wish we could have the conversation directly. I think we have actually seen more of a divergence in strategies and thinking among companies in our industry over the last few years, and we haven\u2019t a long time. And everybody\u2019s got a slightly different take on where they are going and where their strengths are. And so I can\u2019t speak for another company. I will just tell you, it is very similar to what I was saying in response to Paul Sankey question. I think the companies that can be reliable efficient low cost providers will continue to have a very strong position as leaders in our industry. And the world is not ready to transition to another source of energy in large part anytime soon. And so the resumption of economic growth will require the sources of energy that we know today and that fuel the world today. And there will be a need for what we do. And I think you have to be very honest with yourself about where you are going and where you are not. And you have got to focus on improving in closing gaps where you need to improve and getting even better where you have strengths. So, again, it kind of gets back to the fundamentals, capital discipline, cost discipline, project execution, and the ability. And I would say it, if we haven\u2019t said it clearly enough. Your balance sheet is a great asset. And oftentimes we think of our upstream or downstream assets as the most important asset and they are very, very important in our business. The balance sheet is also a very important asset, you have to treat it with a priority, you have to be prepared for the day when you need to rely on that asset, and I think that also becomes very, very important, as we move forward. We have been prudent in the way we have managed that, we were positioned differently than others as we went into this. And I think you can see, as I said, while we wouldn\u2019t have predicted this exact market scenario, we were prepared for an environment like this. And we will navigate our way through it with our shareholders in mind. Second question. Pierre Breber : Yes. Second question is around cash CapEx, of the $14 billion guide, how much of that cash CapEx? And how much further can that go down without impeding cash flow in production?  Yes, so again, sorry, Doug, we couldn\u2019t get you on. So that 9.3 billion is the cash CapEx equivalent to 14. So it was it was 10.5 at 16. So it went down 1.2 of the 2 billion additional reduction is in cash capital. I think Mike has addressed that I addressed it with sustaining CapEx. Again at the CapEx levels into Jeanine\u2019s question when we are at $12 billion, when you back out, reduced downstream and exploration, we are below the level to sustain short-term production. And again, that is a deliberate decision, because there is not a lot of value in putting capital that results in production at current prices. We are investing and I should have said to Jeanine\u2019s answer, although we are below the $10 billion let\u2019s call sustaining capital on bass and shale and tight which will cause some decline. We are investing in TCO, FGP/WPMP which will come on in 2022 and 2023 and provides that kind of long-term value. So again, the choices that Mike and the leadership team are making are really balancing the short-term and the long-term and being thoughtful about where the capital reductions are and where the capital investments are. Michael Wirth : Thanks, Doug, for your questions. Jonathan, we will pick the next one in the queue. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. Along the lines of what you said about the energy transition you know not being as realistic perhaps as what a lot of folks are saying. Your CO2 targets assumed pre-COVID production rate, given that across the board volumes will be coming down. Are you looking to upsize those decarburization targets that you put out last summer? Michael Wirth : Yes, Pavel, it is interesting. Everybody in the industry has defined their targets just a little bit differently. And we haven\u2019t actually put out absolute targets, which you would expect absolute greenhouse gas emissions to come down if people are restricting activity. We put out intensity targets. So a greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production. We had a target for per barrel of oil in the upstream we had a target performance for gas production. And then we have got flaring and methane emission targets. All of which are unit targets that drive down unit emissions. And so we have not reset those, we would expect that we will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, irrespective of COVID or any of these other circumstances, these are commitments we have made, we have tied people\u2019s compensation to them. And we intend to continue to reduce our emissions footprint. Pierre Breber : And just the other add to the other distinction is that we have done it on an equity basis. So whether we operate or don\u2019t operate our whole, all the barrels or all the MCS are in those intensity metrics that Mike talked about, not just our operated barrels. Pavel Molchanov : Alan, if I may. Is there any change in the historical linkage between Asian LNG prices and Brent crude given what is happened in the last 60-days? Michael Wirth : Probably contracts have not changed and of course, we sell most of our volume on contract. Our contracts typically are linked to not linked to Brent directly, but linked to JCC or Japanese crude cocktail is another one is linked to a JKM index, which is a gas related index. So I think commodity prices, have some sympathetic relationship with one another, but they are not always perfectly correlated. And so I think you would certainly say that our crude linked contracts will reflect crude prices. And to the extent Brent has come off, eventually our accrued linked contracts will reflect that, they tend to be on a lag basis. And so they don\u2019t always reflect current month pricing. But broadly speaking, yes, you will see a connection between those two. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore. Doug Terreson : Good morning everybody. Mike, you guys were an early and a power adopter of the discipline capital management model and that is obviously serve your shareholders well during the upturn, and now the downturn too. So first, kudos to you guys for that. And then to the points about industry stress I think Paul brought up earlier, which often lead to consolidation. My question is well, financial benefits are often available on a variety of transactions, strategic benefits on the scale that you guys received from Golf and Texaco and Unocal back in the day, may or may or may not be this time around. And so I want to see if you find a strategic condition today. How you think it is similar or different from prior downturns given your history. And also any other notable color or philosophy that that you want to share on this topic? Michael Wirth : So, I guess if you go back, all the way to Golf. And that takes you back to the 80s. The industry was highly fragmented even amongst the largest players. And so there were, as you say, financial benefit of consolidation and there were strategic benefits as you brought together portfolios that had that had gaps in them. And we certainly saw that with Gulf, we saw it again with Texaco, I think today we have got fewer large players and so the impact of any single transaction that is not amongst large players, and those are pretty hard to do as you get down to small numbers. They are less profound both from a financial standpoint simply because you are you don\u2019t have the same scale that you are consolidating and it flows through to the asset portfolios. And so that the players that like ourselves in our big peers have exposure to many basins around the world to all segments of the value chain. And I think everybody has worked to try to optimize their portfolios in a way that I think fits with their strategy. And so I think your point is a good one you can do kind of rifle shots, that would be maybe smaller bore both on the financial and the strategic dimension that could fill in nicely. But things that would be transformative the way we saw back around the 99 and 2000 period. I think you are right. I think that is a lot harder to envision today. Everybody\u2019s become more efficient and so even the synergies that, that we saw back then, our technology was different information technology was different, our productivity was different and so I think competition has made everybody sharper and more efficient financial synergies are harder to capture. Doug Terreson : Okay. Thanks for the color Mike. Michael Wirth : Okay Dough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question please. Biraj Borkhataria : So, I will get my two questions just in case. But um, the first one is on the Permian and shut-ins driven by economics. So, I guess you mentioned that 50% of the curtailment is in the U.S. and then most of that is the Permian. I was wondering if you could talk about the process on how you got to the number you are looking to curtail and why that is the appropriate number for the environment. You see, that would be the first question. And then second question is on the on your CapEx reduction. Obviously, part of this is economics, but there is another element which is not necessarily choice. So, you mentioned slowing down and then 10 GIS. I was wondering if there is an element of the CapEx or quantify the element of CapEx that is simply CapEx that you couldn\u2019t spend even if you wanted to for logistical reasons or otherwise, just trying to get a sense of that would be helpful? Michael Wirth : Yes. Okay. Well on Permian curtailment. We have said we have pulled capital down significantly so we are not putting capital into bring new production online and as you are looking at flowing production, not every barrel is created equally we have got we have got some older vertical wells, for instance, that, that in this kind of an environment have pretty marginal economics, we would look at those. We have got barrels that have a different oil gas ratio, we would look at that, we look at net backs logistics and value chain cash flow, storage cost future prices, a whole host of things and then as I mentioned earlier the desire to avoid a future need for abrupt shut ins if we receive logistics and flow curtailed. So there are a series of things that we have got a team looking at across the entire basin, and factoring into decisions that we think are prudent decisions from a value standpoint and an operating standpoint, and it is a moving target. We, actually this is something that our senior leadership team is involved in multiple times a week. And so the models to do this to understand markets and to stay really in touch with markets, to be sure we are making good decisions continue to be informed by new information and so it is a very dynamic process that we are engaged in right now. On the capital side on the kind of nondiscretionary non our choice capital Pierre can you take? Pierre Breber : Yes, I think the vast majority are our decisions and choices we are making. But it gets into how you define it, for example, it can gives, we are choosing to demob the noncritical path, project personnel. But clearly that is, that is COVID related. So I don\u2019t know, if you call that a choice. We have a crisis management team that is overseeing supply chains and the whole system. But the bottom line is the vast majority, our decisions that we are making. In some cases with partners we are seeing in almost all cases, partners are very aligned on actions that we are taking.  Now we do have some currency effects, right, so the dollar is stronger. So there is part of the capital reduction. It is also very modest. That is a reflection of currency effects. But I would look at the vast majority of the 30% reduction as being choices that we are making to flex capital, pace capital, defer capital that is largely driven by our decisions to balance cash flow and long-term value. Thanks Biraj. Biraj Borkhataria : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Jason, your line is open. You might have your phone on mute. And we are still not hearing you. Michael Wirth : Okay, I guess we see. It looks like maybe he\u2019s dropped off. Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question, Jonathan. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from line Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : So I will ask sort of a focus question. We have gone over a lot of high level stuff. But, because your downstream footprint, I\u2019m pretty good look into Asia. Some other operators have been talking about some interesting observations they have made about, the timing disparity between Asia emerging from COVID crisis versus the rest of the world and kind of using it as maybe a soft proxy around the slope that demand might recover or what that might look like on the other side of this. Could you share whatever observations or thoughts you have around what you are seeing? Michael Wirth : Yes, Sam, it is a great quote from  Asia is a figment of the Western imagination. He said it was more of a cultural quote, but it is a big area is the reason I bring that up. And what is happening in China is different than what is happening in Indonesia right now. And what is happening in South Korea is different than what is happening in Thailand. And so, broadly speaking, I would say, Asia and other parts of the world, it would appear the demand has found a bottom and that we are kind of bumping along the bottom right now.  And the biggest hit has been on aviation fuels. And then you have got gasoline, which is off 50% give or take around most of the world\u2019s diesel, more like 25%. And so these numbers generally hold in most of the places where we are doing business right now. And then you have regional signals and signs that things are starting to move. China clearly has come off the bottom. Some other markets in Asia that have seen kind of a second wave and they have reinstituted some of these lockdown type policies. The green shoots seem to have pulled back a little bit.  So I would say it is highly specific to the market in Asia where you are. But there are certainly signs in a number of markets of a resumption of activity and resumption of demand growth. And they tend to correlate pretty well with when the policies are relaxed, and people can begin to get back to work and start to move around again. And so I think there are small positive signals, we are getting earlier this week where we talked about it being the beginning of the - beginning. I think, it feels like we are finding the bottom right now. And then the path up out of this is likely to be different, in different regions of the world as it ties to the health status in those parts of the world. But I think this quarter, and perhaps next quarter feel like we are about in the as I said, bumping along the bottom and going to begin to emerge out of it here at some point over that time. Thanks Sam. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from line. Brian Todd from Siemens Energy. Your question please. Brian Todd : Great. Good morning everybody. Maybe a couple quick one. The $2 billion of additional CapEx cuts on the fuzzy charts. It looks like it is coming from a kind of spread across all businesses. Any additional color and where the cuts are coming from and in the Permian, I think that the X rate at the end of the year was still the same. So maybe any thoughts and how we think of the trajectory there in the Permian? And then I have follow-up. Michael Wirth : So the two billion. Broadly, you can take about a little bit less than a billion coming out of a major capital project. And that is primarily TCO. So we had already factored in a little bit of reduction in TCO in the first reduction down to 16, but not nearly as much as we are seeing now. So call it 800 million or so on major capital projects. About half a billion each on unconventional and on other bass business, and the unconventional would include not only Permian, but also Argentina and Canada. And then about another 200 million coming out of downstream and chemicals.  So I think if you take those and wrap them up, that gets you to the, to the two billion. On the Permian, our guidance still is that will exit the year at roughly the level that we came in are 125,000 barrels lower than what we had initially indicated, if you were to look at the chart we use at the Investor Day meeting. And notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing some curtailments there and we are pulling back on the rigs. The momentum coming into the year has been strong in Permian production growth in the first quarter, which largely reflects wells that were put on production last year and we had more pops in the second half of the year than we did in the first half of the year. First quarter Permian production was strong and so that will kick out here over the middle part of the year and come back off as the effects of the capital reductions and curtailments are roll through the system, but our expectation is that we will exit roughly, where we entered, which is about 125,000 less than numbers we showed you in early March. Brian Todd : Right. Maybe one. I know there is a huge amount of uncertainty right now is a clear but maybe thought that implications as we think of the recovery coming out of this and in a very specific cents on curtailments. what is the what is the signal is it clearly just is it just a nut bag price that will drive the resumption of those volumes, at least on the ones that you operate and control. And then as we think about the budget, as we move out of the current level of spend and you start to work your way back towards maybe the $20 billion level that we were in before, I mean, how do you what are the sort of signals that you see that will, I guess first allow you to turn on curtailed volumes and then allow you to put rigs back to work and in the Permian? Michael Wirth : Yes. So, on the first one on curtailments, I was either going to be market signals or on the economic value of those barrels and net backs will be an important part of that. We will also because we can pull some of these things through the value chain into markets we can what export markets look like what are we have got a refinery that we pull some of our permanent production into. So, refining margins in the value chain opportunities will play into our thinking there as well. So, we look at these things across the entire value chain, but it\u2019ll be an economic signal that says these barrels are being called for by the market and contribution is more positive.  In terms of the capital spending, those are longer cycle decisions than curtailments. And I think you can expect us to be thoughtful and not rush capital back into the market prematurely. But it will be our view on where markets are headed. So, curtailments is kind of more or less where markets are or where they are likely to be in the relative short term. Capital spending is going to be more of a medium term, kind of a view and it is because this flexible asset class, we don\u2019t need to really look at the long term signal we always we always factor that in. But the medium term given the production profile on each individual unconventional we will be looking at signals that suggest that that is strengthening and that the demand is there and you are going to watch OPEC, you are going to watch inventories there is a whole series of indicators. I think that will help us inform decision making there. Pierre Breber : Thanks Brian. Brian Todd : Thank you. Pierre Breber : With that, I would like to thank everyone for your time today. And we do apologize for some technical and audio challenges, rest assured the transcript will certainly be posted shortly after the call today. Michael Wirth : Yes, I appreciate your patience and I apologize for the technical difficulties. I\u2019m not sure what happened, but not only will the transcript be posted, but this will be investigated and corrected. Pierre Breber : Please stay safe and healthy. Jonathan, back to you.

Wayne Borduin : Thank you, Audra, and welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Now, I'll turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Wayne. Second quarter was a challenging one for the company. Financial results included $4.9 billion in special item net charges and a foreign exchange loss of over $400 million. Excluding special items and FX, the quarter resulted in a $3 billion loss or $1.59 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Cash flow from operations was about $100 million, and total capital spending was $03.3 billion, including about $300 million for the Puma Energy, Australia acquisition. Asset sale proceeds for the quarter were about $1.5 billion related to the sale of our Azerbaijan and Colombia upstream businesses. Our dividend was flat with the prior quarter, and we maintained a strong balance sheet. Turning to slide 4. In the second quarter, we recorded over $5 billion in impairments and other non-cash charges. The charges were triggered by the uncertain operating environment and outlook in Venezuela, a lower oil and gas price forecast, due to the anticipated economic impacts of COVID-19 and severance accruals resulting from our transformation initiative. While we are disappointed by the impairment in Venezuela, we intend to maintain a presence in the country and resume normal operations one day. The price-related impairments were primarily related to Stampede, a non-operated field in the Gulf of Mexico; conventional operations in the Permian; and various producing assets in Asia and Africa. These charges were partially offset by a gain on asset sales and various tax items. Turning to slide 5. We remain on track to meet our revised guidance for 2020 capital and operating cost reductions. Organic CapEx in the second quarter was $3 billion, already at a run rate 40% below the original budget. Full year capital guidance remains unchanged at $14 billion, as we will need to see sustained economic recovery and much lower inventories before considering raising activity levels. Operating costs are also trending lower, in line with our expectation of $1 billion savings compared to 2019. Organization design from our transformation efforts is complete. Employee selections are underway, and we expect to be operating under our new model in the fourth quarter, delivering additional run rate savings next year. Turning to the next slide. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're on track to grow the dividend for the 33rd straight year. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was low due to the market environment. This was partially offset by lower cash CapEx and asset sale proceeds. Higher debt this quarter included our successful bond issuance in May. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt ratio below 17%, well ahead of our competitors. Turning to slide 7. Second quarter earnings were low -- were lower due to a swing of over $6 billion in special items and FX versus the same period last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower prices, including greater differentials to benchmark crudes due to market volatility and reduced liftings volumes, primarily due to curtailments and prior upstream asset sales. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes to match decreased demand and unfavorable timing effects. Turning to slide 8, compared to the first quarter, second quarter adjusted earnings decreased by over $5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased by about $3 billion, primarily due to lower liquids realizations, lower sales volumes mainly due to curtailments and an unfavorable swing in timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased by almost $2 billion, primarily due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects, lower margins and lower sales volumes. Chevron's refinery system ran reliably during the quarter, with crude utilization well below capacity due to lower demand. The other segment decreased primarily due to an unfavorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation. I'll now pass it over to Jay. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pierre. On slide 9, second quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was flat compared to a year ago. During the quarter, increased Permian shale and tight production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and turnarounds. The curtailments were at the low end of our guidance range as prices recovered from historic lows late in the quarter. I'm really proud that our employees have kept our upstream operations running safely and reliably during this global pandemic. With all of the challenges of moving people and equipment, and of course, personal concerns at home, our employees have risen to the occasion to deliver the energy needed in recovering economies. Turning to the Permian. We're making disciplined choices to balance short-term cash flow, while preserving long-term value. In response to the current market conditions, we quickly reduced our flexible capital program across the portfolio and in the Permian, expect quarterly capital spend in the second half of the year to be about 75% lower than the first quarter. As of July, we've reduced our operated rig count to four with one completion crew. Although the level of activity in the Permian has rapidly changed, our focus on efficiency has not. By the end of this year, we expect to double the lateral feet drilled per rig compared to 2018. With lower capital investments and our improving efficiency, we still expect to be free cash flow positive this year at strip pricing. As shown on slide 11, the short-term outlook for Permian production has changed as a result of the lower capital spending. After curtailments in May and June, we're back to full production and expect second half production to be in line with the first half. At current activity levels, we expect production to decline about 6% to 7% in 2021. Early next year, we'll update 2021 production guidance for the Permian and the rest of Chevron's upstream portfolio. As stated in our first quarter 10-Q, we expect lower capital spending to result in the demotion of proved undeveloped reserves, primarily in the Permian. These barrels may be rebooked as proved reserves when funding and activity levels increase. The near-term production profile for the Permian has changed, but our long-term view of the asset's attractiveness has not. With our scale, efficient factory drilling, and royalty advantage, we believe we're well-positioned to maximize returns and deliver value. Turning to TCO. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we continue to make progress with our future growth wellhead pressure management project at Tengiz, and the project is now 79% complete. All site fabrication is complete, and all modules have now departed Korea. Our logistics system is working well, and we expect to receive all the remaining modules in Tengiz this year. The remaining project scope is primarily the construction and commissioning work in Tengiz. We made excellent progress on site construction through the end of last year and the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, as a result of the COVID pandemic, we reduced our construction workforce to 20% of plan. As a result, overall construction progress has been impacted due to the limited construction workforce. Let's turn to the next slide. TCO is working hard to mitigate the risk from the pandemic by closely coordinating with health experts and regulatory agencies to implement safeguards that protect our workforce. Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, the project team is focused on remobilizing the Tengiz construction workforce and completing the final sealift. A return to work planned for about 20,000 FGP construction personnel is set to begin in August, and we will continue as conditions allow. Critical path activities such as the delivery and installation of the first two pressure boost compressor modules remain on track. Foundations and access roads are complete, and the team is preparing to receive, restack and install these modules. With the high field productivity and progress over the winter, we were ahead of schedule but now have limited schedule float remaining. Our ability to complete the remobilization and sustain the construction workforce through the pandemic is key to limiting further impacts to the project. We're focused on safely progressing the project, and we expect to be able to provide more specific updates to project cost and schedule early next year. Now I'll give it back to Pierre. Thanks. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent announcements. On July 1st, we safely started up production in the Partition Zone and completed the first export this week. Also, we closed the acquisition of Puma Energy, Australia. These assets will integrate with our refining and marketing value chain in Asia Pacific and extend the valued Caltex brand in the region. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with Algonquin, a leader in renewable power generation, to co-develop renewable power projects that will support our operations. Initial project assessments will be focused on the Permian, Argentina, Kazakhstan and Australia. Turning to the next slide. Last week, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire Noble Energy. As the necessary regulatory and approval steps progress, we've also launched our integration planning efforts. Representatives from both companies are meeting today to kick-off the planning discussion, and we look forward to integrating Noble's complementary assets, people and capabilities into Chevron. Looking ahead, we anticipate a straightforward and fast integration. Our internal transformation efforts should help us efficiently integrate the new organization and achieve our synergy targets. Now looking forward on slide 16, in the third quarter, we expect production curtailments of about 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day primarily due to the OPEC+ agreement. Planned turnarounds, primarily in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, are expected to impact production by about 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes an extension of the turnaround at Gorgon until early September. In Australia, we expect LNG contract pricing to be lower due to the 3 month to 6 month lag with oil prices. Based on our current outlook, full year net production is expected to be roughly flat with 2019, including the effects of curtailment. And TCO co-lending is expected to be about $2 billion for the year. In downstream, turnaround activity is estimated to have an after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. We expect our other segment earnings and distributions less affiliate income to be in line with prior guidance, excluding the impact of this quarter's special items. Turning to our last slide. With health, economic and social crises all happening at the same time, this was a challenging quarter for Chevron and its stakeholders and a reminder of the importance of the S in ESG. We're proud of the work we're doing with social investments in our communities, pay equity for our employees and our supply chain spend with women and minority-owned businesses. You can read about this and more in our sustainability report, which was published in the second quarter. So with concerns for the health of our loved ones, economic uncertainty in our communities and expectations for racial justice and equal opportunity, we know that there's more work to do. On the right of the slide is the company's five-point action plan in response to current market conditions. We're proud of how our employees are executing this plan and delivering on what we can control. We entered this crisis in a better place than our competitors, and we intend to exit stronger and more valuable for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh at JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Yes, hi good morning. First question is just kind of tying together the commentary in the Permian for next year being down 6% to 7% with your CapEx commentary that you've provided, which I think in the past, you've said $3 billion quarterly run rate for second half CapEx on a C&E basis, not on a cash CapEx basis. So, is the Permian commentary consistent with just keeping that CapEx at that type of run rate in the second half of the year? Pierre Breber : Yes. So, we had an approved budget of $20 billion. When we announced our market response plan and then updated it at our earnings call, we reduced the full year to $14 billion average, but a run rate of $12 billion essentially for the second half of the year. We achieved that a quarter early. So, if you back out the Puma Energy (Australia) acquisition, we were at $3 billion already in the second quarter and that's obviously at that $12 billion annual run rate, which is a 40% reduction. And embedded in that are the reductions that Jay referred to in the Permian and operating at the current 4 rigs and one completion crew. Phil Gresh : Okay, got it. So, you keep it at that level in 2021 for a 6% to 7% decline? Pierre Breber : Well, yes, I'm sorry. So, yes, we haven't given capital guidance for 2021. We're in the middle of our planning process. We'll do our normal disclosure and sharing of what our capital budget is for 2021 in December when we've completed our plan and the Board has approved the plan. What we are showing is it's just an outlook based on current activity level. We, early on, guided to Permian production being about 20% lower on the exit rate from -- relative to our Investor Day guidance. And actually, we're doing a bit better than that. So that would have taken us down a little bit lower than what you're seeing on that chart. And then executing this plan and staying at this activity level, yes, we project that kind of guidance. We're not giving production guidance. There's a lot of time between now and then. We're just sort of showing what the outlook looks like if activity levels stay at the same level. It will depend on what the economic recovery is, with inventory levels and a number of factors will determine what our activity level will be in the Permian going forward. Phil Gresh : Okay, got it. My second question just would be on Gorgon. There have been some media reports out there talking about some operational hiccups on Train 2 and getting that restarted, I think, you were planning in mid-July. It sounds like maybe it's early September at this point. But could you just elaborate on what's happening there? What the root cause of this delay is? And what it would mean for being able to meet contractual obligations? I think you're about 80% contracted at Gorgon, but just any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Jay Johnson : Yes. Phil, I'll take that one. So, our fundamental concern is operating safely and reliably and we're always going to take decisions in alignment with that. As part of our normal operations, we take trains down for turnarounds to do inspections and maintenance. And during the Train 2 turnaround, what we found in the Train 2 propane heat exchangers or kettle, some call them, we saw some well defects. So, we developed a repair procedure, and they're progressing well on those repairs. We expect them to be fully accomplished here in the near term, and we expect to have the train up and running in early September. All the other planned work for the turnaround has already been completed. So, the focus really is just on completing these repairs to the propane heat exchangers. We're going to use the findings from what we saw in train 2 to plan the appropriate actions for train 1 and train 3. But at this point, train 1 and 3 run normally as expected. And we've actually seen good stable operations out of them. So at this point, there have not been challenges in delivering on our commitments, and I don't anticipate that as we look forward. Wayne Borduin : Okay. Thank you, Phil. Operator : We'll move next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much. I guess the first question I have for Pierre is it's obviously a pretty tough quarter. But, I wasn't necessarily expecting cash from operations ex-working capital to be negative. So can you address if there's anything in the quarter that is sort of a one-off item that affected the cash number? Or is this just purely the result of the core pricing margin environment? Pierre Breber : So, look, it was a challenging quarter. We did -- to put in perspective, we had a big beat last quarter, and we had a miss this quarter. And one of the primary drivers we talked about last quarter and -- or we talked about this morning is our timing effects. And as you know, Jason, these are effects that benefit us in a falling oil price environment and reverse in a rising oil price environment. And we saw that, obviously, prices declining in the first quarter and rising in the second quarter. And some of those effects do roll through cash because it's essentially going through our COGS, and it's a timing difference between when COGS are being recognized relative to the underlying margin. In addition to that, look, we had very volatile industry conditions. As you know, we had historic -- historically low prices at times, very volatile pricing. And there were times where we did not capture what the benchmark crudes are indicating. And that was true in the U.S. in certain times with the calendar role and the physical differentials, which we're adjusting very quickly, but it was a very fast-moving situation. And it was true outside the U.S. for certain crudes. CPC blend at times was being discounted more heavily versus Brent. Some of our West African crudes also are being discounted more heavily versus Brent than is typical in a normal trading pattern. And then, we ran much lower utilization on the downstream than is typical. Again, we had unprecedented demand decreases, rapidly changing demand decreases. We were managing our refinery system to be in sync with the demand. In the U.S., we ran -- our crew utilization was 55%, which is well below what the capacity is. And it just points out how extraordinary the conditions were in the second quarter. So that results in much lower volumes than we typically would sell and resulting impact on margins. The last thing I'd point out on earnings and it's not a cash effect is, we do make accruals for stock-based compensation for all employees that have stock-based compensation. And in the first quarter, that was favorable, and there was a swing. So, there's no doubt, there's some non-cash elements in the earnings, but realizations, volumes and aspects of the timing also roll through cash. There was nothing, I would say, that was unusual except the industry conditions that were very unusual and extraordinary. Jason Gammel : No, I appreciate that, Pierre. Hopefully, we won't ever see another quarter like this past one. Second question is for Jay. Jay, this is the first time, we've been able to speak with you since the Noble acquisition was announced. I was hoping you might be able to give us your view of the quality and fit of those assets into the Chevron portfolio, and specifically interested in the Permian acreage, and your view on the East Med and the potential for future expansion. Jay Johnson : Yeah. Thank you. Jason. We're obviously excited to have these assets join our portfolio. I think they're a really nice set of assets, and they have an excellent fit with us. In the case of the Eastern Med and the DJ Basin, we see two new scale -- operations of scale that fit quite well into our capabilities. We've worked for many years in the Middle East, and this is a nice addition to our current portfolio. In Colorado, we're excited to have an entry into the DJ that has such a long running room and good returns. In the Permian, it's a nice add-on to our existing Permian operations in the Delaware Basin and about 90,000 acres coming into our portfolio. So we see good synergies there. And then there are other assets in the Noble portfolio that will be nice assets to have. We'll continue to start evaluating their performance. And just on balance, I'm happy with what's coming into the portfolio. I think it's going to be a really good fit, and there's a lot of good people in the Noble organization as well. We're looking forward to bringing them into the family. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jay Johnson : Good morning, Devin. Devin McDermott : So my first one is on TCO, and just following up on some of the prepared remarks, Jay, that you had. And when we think about the critical path here for the back half of 2020 and really into the next few years, you noted that you have all the materials on site to achieve that critical path. But I wanted to ask specifically on the remobilization of the workforce and how you're planning that to continue to achieve execution on the critical path items as we think about the overall project time line, any risk of delays? Just a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about the interplay there with the critical path and remobilization of workforce? Jay Johnson : Yeah. Thank you. Well, as we've said, we made great progress over the wintertime, and we're actually building ahead of the schedule with the modules being completed on time and coming to us. They're coming to us complete with good quality and dimensionally accurate. So they're meeting all of our expectations, and we expect to have the sealift finished this year. Those are all key elements in maintaining schedule on the project. From the workforce on the ground standpoint, Kazakhstan, like many other countries is going through a significant impact from the COVID. And so as part of our precautions, we demobilized to about 20% of the planned workforce in the second quarter. That's about 20,000 workers that we need to bring back. During June and July, we've been doing a crew change on those people that were remaining in Tengiz, and that's given us a chance to test the systems that we've been putting in place. And those involve testing people at their point of origin before they return to Tengiz. Once they get to Tengiz, we have isolation camps set up, so that we can put people in isolation. Even with negative tests, we still put them in isolation to affect the quarantine period then retest before they're allowed to progress to Tengiz. We're using a pod strategy where we keep groups of workers together but isolated from other groups, and that includes where they live, transportation, how they take meals, trying to make sure we have sufficient mitigations in place to protect that workforce. Our fundamental concern is the safety of the workforce and making sure that we can sustain operations as we rebuild. We expect that mobilization to take place over about a four-month period. But clearly, that's going to be dependent upon the environment in Kazakhstan, as well as just the difficulty of moving people internationally for a project of this scale. And we'll take the learnings as we've done the crew change and continue to adapt as we move forward into the remobilization. Our focus continues on critical path activities, but we've got to also work off a large volume of work that didn't get done in the second quarter. And so to really -- we expect some degree of impact, but to really be able to give you any kind of an updated forecast on cost or schedule, we need to see how this remobilization goes. We need to see how we're able to sustain people at work within the pandemic, and we'll be able to update you, I think, more effectively probably in the first quarter of next year. Q \u2013 Devin McDermott : Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is one relating to the U.S. election and a short-term and a longer-term part. And the shorter-term part is there's a lot of discussion around potential permitting or leasing changes, specifically on federal lands and waters. And one, just how you're thinking about managing that potential risk, given the large presence in the Gulf of Mexico?  And the second part of the question and this is the longer-term piece. There's also some discussion around things like clean energy standard or investments from the federal government into things like clean hydrogen over time. And just how you're thinking about managing the business from an investment strategy longer-term to position Chevron for this potential shifting regulatory environment, maybe within the recent announcement on the renewables partnership with Algonquin and how that fits in the longer-term strategy as well? Pierre Breber : Sure, Devin, I'll start and let Jay address the question on federal leasing. I mean, at the highest level, look, we work well at the federal state and local levels in this country with governments of both parties. And of course, we work with governments with different priorities all around the world.  Energy is essential as the economy and the world economies recover from this pandemic and jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs and are a big part of the economy in a number of states in the U.S. and a number of countries around the world. We think whichever governments in the U.S. or in other countries, the economy will be a priority coming out of this and we think energy will be a big part of that. We're a very responsible company, including our commitment to ESG, which I referred to, and actions we're taking to reduce carbon intensity. So I think our approach on energy transition has three focus areas, things that we can do to lower our carbon intensity.  We have greenhouse gas intensity metrics out to 2023, how we can increase renewables and support our business. So the Algonquin partnership we just announced is just a way to scale up but we've been doing previously. We had some wind and solar to our operations in the Permian and in Bakersfield. And this gives us an alliance and partnership to accelerate that and scale it up globally. We continue to do in the renewable space, renewable natural gas, renewable liquid fuels, actions that reduce the carbon intensity of our products, in particular in California, consistent with the low-carbon fuel standard. And then our third focus area is investing in breakthrough technologies and that includes carbon sequestration, hydrogen, batteries. We are operating the world's -- one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects in Australia. So that's a long answer to say, we've been in business a long time. We intend to be in business a long time. There are elections in this country and a number of countries that are occurring. And we intend to be a constructive force wherever we operate, to be a good partner with whoever is governing at that time. And we think there's a lot of common ground that we can find between what we do as a company and what governments aspire to do. So with that, I'll turn it to Jay. A - Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pierre. I'll build on that by just saying I think there's actually a lot of common ground with where the potential administrations want to go. Because we've already been focused on reducing flaring and methane emissions, our greenhouse gas intensity and producing oil and gas, we've had a head start on this. And we continue to stay focused on reducing the impact that we have as we produce these essential products. We think energy plays an essential role in economic growth. And these jobs in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian are important jobs to the economy. And I think the emphasis on natural gas as a bridging fuel continues to support our operations in both the Gulf of Mexico and Permian. So we'll continue to focus on reducing emissions and lowering our footprint, carbon footprint. But at the same time, we're going to continue to work with whatever administration is in place and work to make sure that the \u2013 there's a good understanding of potential regulation and the impacts that it may have as we move forward. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Devin. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team and thank you for taking the time here. The first question I had is around cash flow breakeven. In the past, Pierre, you've talked about cash flow after CapEx breakeven after 40 at 50, the dividend and at 60, the buyback. Just how do you think about that math there now? There are a lot of moving pieces, particularly with downstream, and there's a lot of flexibility on the CapEx side. But any math you can help us think about your rent breakevens would be helpful for aligning the models? Pierre Breber : Well, Neil, I mean, you're exactly right. When we talk about oil breakevens, we're just talking about one part of the portfolio and not everything else is held constant. So we've had \u2013 we've shown breakevens in the 50s. The actions that we're taking is to get it down in the 40s. That has an assumption around downstream performance, and you will see that in the second quarter. But you'll see that certainly over time. I guess I just would first step back and just say we're in a different place than almost everyone else in our industry. We have one of the strongest balance sheets. We're exiting the quarter here with a net debt ratio of 17%. We've got excellent capital discipline and the ability to flex our capital program down. You saw that we took it down 40% in one quarter with an extraordinary change in the circumstances, reserving the capital and not spending capital to add barrels that just aren't needed, right now as the world is contracting and then coming out of it and hopefully recovering in a sustainable way. We've been ahead of others. We started our asset sales and signed asset sales last year. And you saw those close this quarter, generating cash. And again, we started our restructuring well before COVID, and we're on plan. And we have that work on track. And of course, we signed an agreement to acquire Noble Energy last week. So we \u2013 all of our actions are designed consistent with our financial priorities. The first is to sustain and grow the dividend. We showed our stress test last quarter, $30, that I think was made very clear that we have the financial capability and the flexibility in our capital program, the ability to manage our costs to sustain that dividend through what is a stress test. And we're continuing to sustain long-term value of the business. So although, we're taking activity back in the Permian because it brings on production in months and not years, that capital will come back when the world needs the energy, and the value inherent in that resource is still there. And of course, we're making investments as Jay has talked about in Tengiz, which will come on in several years. And again, we're maintaining a strong balance sheet. So that's the high-level framework. Our goal is to get our breakeven as obviously as low as we can. We're planning for lower for longer. It's a very uncertain environment to Jason's question. We hope second quarter was the bottom. It sure feels like it. Things are definitely better than they were in the second quarter, in particular in that April-May time frame. But we've got a plan for lower for longer, show our downside resiliency. We know how to manage the upside. That won't be a problem, but make sure we support the long-term value, so that we can not only just pay the dividend now, but sustain and grow it over time. Jay Johnson : Yes. Just to build on that a little bit, Pierre. One of the things I really like about the assets as well coming from Noble is that they also have great capital flexibility. So it fits our strategy quite well. And about 75% of the proved reserves have already been developed. So the big capital is largely in the past, and now we're looking at the -- run opportunities for these assets. Neil Mehta : Appreciate it. And a follow-up here is around impairments. You took $4.8 billion in the quarter. Can you just talk about the framework by which you look at impairments? Obviously, your system is a little different than the IFRS system of some of your competitors. Do you think you're through the bulk of said impairments? And just talk about your approach to calibrating them? Pierre Breber : Sure. Well, let me start with fourth quarter when we took large impairments and those were primarily related to capital decisions, right? Decisions that we made that were primarily natural gas-related. And this, again, of course, is pre-COVID, but in a capital disciplined way and trying to drive higher returns, being really ruthless about where our capital is invested and making difficult choices. And that was primarily the impact of the impairments that we saw in the fourth quarter. This quarter, it was primarily for two reasons : one, unique situation, Venezuela, which I'll comment on, and I'm sure Jay will add to; and we did lower our price outlook based on the economic impacts from the global pandemic. So we don't know what the impacts will be. But clearly, with the economic contraction and assuming economic recovery clearly, but it just results in lower demand for some time period. And we reflected that in lower prices. So in Venezuela, it's been a difficult operating environment for a while. Each quarter, we've been assessing our investment value. In the second quarter, the environment became even more difficult. As an example, our net production -- our share of net production in June was just 7,000 barrels a day. So it's really fallen off. And so under the accounting rules and the U.S. GAAP accounting rules, we have to assess whether the loss in value is other than temporary. And if we view it as other than temporary, we take an impairment. And unlike IFRS, it's a one -- it only goes in one direction. The other ones were tied to the oil price, and I talked about a few of those, and then we had a severance. So again, we follow U.S. GAAP. We're going to look at it each quarter. What I can say is the impairments this quarter, for the most part, had a different nature than last quarter. And maybe one comment on the price-related ones, and I'll kick it to Jay to talk about Venezuela. The price-related ones are really hitting either mature assets, late-in-life assets, where the remaining production term just gets impacted by the lower price outlook. The long-lived assets all are -- were not impaired. It was really mature remaining short-life direction -- duration where a lower price impacts the carrying value. But maybe Jay can comment on Venezuela. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pierre. Venezuela, we took the impairment there, but our fundamental approach has not changed. And that's what we are still committed to being present in Venezuela, and we look forward to one day resuming full operations. Our license was extended to the 1st of December, 2020, and that license allows us to take on the activities for safety and maintaining asset integrity. And our focus is on keeping people and the assets and operations safe. We support communities in Venezuela. We believe we're a force for good. We'll continue to be compliant with all laws and regulations, both in U.S. and Venezuela. And we just take it a day at a time, but our commitment still remains. And we think the underlying asset value is still there. Neil Mehta : Thanks very much. Operator : We'll move next to Paul Sankey at Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, everyone. Can you hear me okay? Pierre Breber : Yes. Hi, Paul. Paul Sankey : Hi. Thanks. A couple of things. Firstly, on problems that you had in the quarter, a couple of the other mega oil companies had very good trading results. Was it fair to characterize you guys as having a smaller trading operation and appetite, as a result of us not seeing a whole lot of benefit in the quarter, I was just wondering? And the second follow-up is, you mentioned breakeven. I think, Jay, and I'm sure Jay in his comments also mentioned breakeven. I thought he said breakeven at strip by the end of the year. So are you talking about getting down towards 40? Did I -- if I got that wrong in my head? Could you just clarify what's in those various moving parts? It might be downstream or I might have missed that, apologies. But if you could just bring that together for me. Thanks a lot. Pierre Breber : Okay. Let me just address the breakeven question. And I think that was me -- or who? Devin asked that. Well, anyway, whoever asked it. So, again, our breakeven in last year and early this quarter was low 50s. And the actions we're taking, again, to reduce capital and reduce costs, which are right on track with our guidance and are going very well. Everything else held constant, that would take our breakeven into the 40s. But not everything else is held constant. In particular, downstream and chemicals, we\u2019ve talked about weaker margins and lower -- much lower volume. So we'll have to see as that shakes out. But as the downstream stabilizes over time, then those reductions should flow through to a lower breakeven. We talked about Permian being free cash flow positive at strip pricing. So this year, in the Permian -- and remember, we had that also as guidance in our Investor Day. It was at a much higher investment level as we run a different trajectory. But even now, this investment level and all the changes that are going on, we affirm that we'll still be free cash flow positive. But that was only specific to the Permian, and that was at strip pricing. If we go to trading, we don't disclose our trading earnings separately. I wouldn't exactly characterize our trading organization the way you said. But we've been pretty clear that the priorities for the trading organization are flow -- ensuring the flow of our upstream barrels and in and out of our refineries, to optimize around those positions and then to trade. And, certainly, at times in the quarter, the market had steep contango, which created trading opportunities for our organization. And you'll see those results in the upstream and downstream segments this quarter and in future quarters. Paul Sankey : Okay. Thanks. So apologies for misunderstanding. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Paul. Operator : We'll go next to Jeanine Wai at Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Pierre Breber : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. My first question is on the overall business. And, I guess, understanding that growth is an output of capital allocation decision. You're working really hard to materially reduce the cost structure. Is there an opportunity for Chevron to meet the prior ROCE and 3% CAGR targets that you laid out at the analyst meeting at a Brent price below the former $60 that you talked about? Or are those targets just kind of no longer the right way to think about the business, given your updated view on macro? I know you just mentioned that you were planning for lower for longer. Pierre Breber : Well, let me start and Jay might want to add. I mean, yes, certainly, the ability to deliver that kind of production volume is there, because all of the resource and the opportunities, whether it's in the Permian, whether it's the other opportunities we showed during our Investor Day, they are all there. Now there's no doubt, we had our Investor Day on March 3. And by that weekend, and we showed a $60 Brent nominal flat pricing for five years, which everyone agreed was a reasonable assumption, I think. And by the weekend, oil was in the 30s, and the Russian savvy agreement fell apart. And then a few weeks later, we were in a massive economic contraction. So there's no doubt that the world has changed from that Investor Day, and we're in the middle of our planning process, and we'll provide revised updated guidance. But our ability to deliver that kind of production is absolutely there. The question will be, is that still the right strategy? I think we have to step back and look at a sector that is underperforming the broader equity markets. And we're underperforming primarily because of low returns and a lack of capital discipline. So when you hear us talk about capital discipline in our organic portfolio and the actions that Jay is taking to be disciplined with our capital and in our downstream, too, being disciplined around the capital to approach the energy transition to Devin's question, we have to do that in a disciplined way. And then organically, inorganically, we have to be disciplined with capital. The only way to increase returns and regain favor with investors, it's not by outgrowing and is not by having capital flowing back into opportunities. It's by being very disciplined and generating high returns by being really ruthless in our allocation. So I think that's all the way to say is we're going to revise our plans. All the opportunities are there. Whether that's the most optimal outlook going forward, we'll decide. But our commitment to capital discipline, our commitment to raising returns is going to continue, and it's essential for us to be able to deliver higher returns over time. Jay Johnson : Yes. I think to build on that, we were -- we had very strong performance last year and coming into this. But well before the COVID crisis hit, we had already embarked on a transformation effort, and that transformation effort was all encompassing. It covers every aspect of the company. And it's really built on trying to better integrate technology into our operations and our workflows, making sure that we're as efficient as we can be across our organizations, how do we provide technical services to our business units. In the upstream, we reduced from four to three regions. That went into effect July 1. We've reduced one to two layers across our organization. We're building on that geographic-based business unit in the upstream, which has served us so well, but we're adding in asset class coordination across business units. So we can better team and perform across business unit boundaries, geographic boundaries and segment boundaries. And we've also added in additional focus on value chains and making sure that we're getting the highest realization for our upstream products that we can all the way through the value. So the transformation itself, while it involves some restructuring, I think some of the biggest impact that's going to come is around how we think about the business, the financial fluency that we're getting throughout our workforce to focus on improving returns and understanding where the gaps are between what's possible and where we are today as well as incorporating, as Pierre said, the lower-for-longer mentality, the lower activity levels, lower turnaround activity and some of the other effects that we're seeing. So as you put all this together, I think we'll continue to see not only the commitments towards lowering our cost structure, but I do think we're going to find ways to continue to drive for that aspiration of improving returns. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Thank you -- answer. Yes. My follow-up is kind of a similar question but on the Permian. In terms of just looking medium and longer term and on the efficiency improvements that you mentioned, before you've mentioned that Chevron can grow the Permian to about 1.2 million barrels a day at $4 billion to $5 billion of your CapEx. I know that's a ways off. But beyond the drilling efficiencies that you mentioned and assuming there's a recovery in demand, how material could some of these efficiency improvements be that you've mentioned? Meaning, specifically, based on what you've seen, do you think you could deliver the same or similar productive capacity of that 1.2 million a day but on materially lower CapEx? Jay Johnson : Yes, Jeanine. I think, we're poised to continue to drive increased efficiency throughout the Permian operations. The drilling is just one example where we're seeing that efficiency, but the advances in technology, the advances in our understanding of the reservoirs and how to best complete and produce from those. The integration of our operation centers, the maintenance, the operations are all driving efficiency. While the near-term activity levels, we've changed those because we can and because we think it's prudent, given the current environment that we find ourselves in, the underlying long-term value and even mid-term value of this asset is unchanged. And I'm actually really excited about the changes that we're making and how we are working together in the organization. And so I do expect to see us be able to deliver on previous expectations and continue to deliver on becoming a more efficient, more effective operator in the Permian Basin. Thanks, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng at Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Jay Johnson : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : I have two questions. I think one for Jay, one for Pierre. Jay, you mentioned about the problem in Gorgon. It's a bit surprising, given it's a new machine. I mean, the feed has only come on stream for, say, less than five years and that you have this problem. So is the problem? Is a design issue or that is just poor workmanship? And also whether the same vendor is applying those to the Train 1 and Train 3 as well as Wheatstone? And if they are, have you already did some inspection on those units? Jay Johnson : Yes, Paul. So the defects that we found in the wells, we believe were there from the original manufacturer. They're not a design defect at all, but they are a manufacturing defect. They were discovered in train 2, when we took train 2 down for its first major turnaround and inspection. And as I said, as part of the routine inspection, that's when we encountered this particular issue. We are evaluating based on the learnings that we've got how to best address Trains 1 and 3. And we put additional mitigations in place until that's been accomplished. We do not have the same manufacturer for the vessels in Wheatstone. It's a different manufacturer, and I don't expect to see the same issue replicated there. Paul Cheng : And Jay, train 1 and train 3 already went through the full turnaround recently, right, just in the last year or two? Jay Johnson : No. Train 1 went through the turnaround last year. Train 3 is scheduled for next year. Paul Cheng : So that's a risk. Yes, Train 3 is more of the risk than Train 1 then because I assume that if there's an issue, when you went through the turnaround in train 1 you should have already discovered? Jay Johnson : We did not see the issue in Train 1, but we're assessing whether or not we need to reevaluate that inspection and go through it again. And we are addressing how best to inspect and if necessary, repair Train 3 at this time. Paul Cheng : Okay. So Train 3... Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Paul. Second question? Paul Cheng : Sure. Second question is for Pierre. I heard about, say, the improving return is one of the top priority for the company. We appreciate that. But we then hear that, we have conflicting maybe priority because you \u2013 from a cash flow standpoint, you are cutting your CapEx in Permian, and Permian actually is your highest return project, while that you're still investing in Anchor and Tengiz, which is clearly that much lower return comparing to Permian. So how exactly that the company is going to be able to raise your return, when you are not investing at least in the next maybe year or two in the most profitable project? I mean, what steps that you will be able to take? Jay Johnson : So Paul, one of the things we're doing, as you know, we've been bringing our unit development cost in the deepwater down significantly. Our target is to be below $20 a barrel. Anchor, as we've talked about in the past, opens up new opportunities for us and a new class of deepwater assets. We are pacing the development of Anchor in its most efficient pace. We're not focused on having to bring it on by a certain date, but rather keeping all the different aspects of the project consistent and aligned as we move through the impacts of the COVID crisis. In terms of the Permian, it's simply \u2013 we don't see the point of investing in any assets around the world to bring on new production capacity, when the world is so heavily oversupplied. And so because we have that flexibility, we're exercising that, and we'll continue to look at the current environment, and begin ramping up funding and activities when it's appropriate to do so. And we see a better overall supply-demand balance, better fundamentals for the industry. Pierre Breber : Yes. Only add to what Jay said, look, we're going to be diversified across different asset classes. We're not going to be a pure-play company, and they're operating on different time frames. And one involves production that comes on in years, and one involves production that comes on in months, and we're making that distinction. So we've been laser-focused on capital that supports long-term value, capital that's adding short-term production has been hit very hard. Thanks, Paul. We appreciate your questions. Operator : We'll move next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah. Thanks, good morning. I guess two things to follow up on. First question for you, Jay, on TCO. Just what do you think the critical \u2013 you mentioned critical path items. What are those in 2020 and 2021 we really ought to keep our eyes on for confidence that the project is coming along as expected? And then I don't know. if the second question is for Pierre or for you. But as you think about your outlook for the Permian unconventional in 2021 to down 6% to 7% when does that become a written-in-stone event versus something that you could tweak and we could see something different? Jay Johnson : So, the critical path for TCO, FGP project, it really runs through the setting of all the utility modules and the compressor boost facilities for the wellhead pressure management part of the project and getting those fully integrated. And that's where our real focus is. So it's mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work once those modules are set on their foundations. That really represents the main focus. But there's a lot of work as well that has to be maintained in parallel with that to be able to deliver the project as expected. A - Pierre Breber Yeah. And look, on the Permian, we could bring completion crews back very quickly, if that were to happen. So again, it's just \u2013 we're in the middle of our planning process. We'll update our capital budget. But even after we have a capital budget, we can reallocate capital if the world changes. And there's a lot of flexibility in the Permian. It goes back to the earlier question, there's a lot of value there. So we'd want to see the sustained economic recovery, see inventory levels heading down, but it's something that we could change very quickly with -- by adding completion crews and then adding rigs over time. A - Jay Johnson : Just as we brought it down, we can take it backup. Pierre Breber :   Thanks, Roger. Roger Read : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks for squeezing in guys. I just got a couple of quick ones. Pierre, perhaps you could just elaborate on your change of price assumption? And what I'm really looking for is do you anticipate that you will continue to add debt, given you've got substantial headroom as you pointed out last quarter over the foreseeable future? Pierre Breber : I'm sorry. You broke up a little bit on your question, Doug. Can you say that again? Doug Leggate : Yes. So can you hear me now? Pierre Breber :   Yes. Doug Leggate :   Okay. So do you anticipate adding additional debt, given you've still got substantial headroom as you pointed out last quarter? And if you could elaborate, please, on the change on price assumptions that you referred to earlier. Pierre Breber : Yes. So on the price assumption, I'm not sure I can say much more. We don't disclose our price outlooks. We view it as commercially sensitive. We're obviously in the market at times selling or buying assets, and we wouldn't want our counterparty to know what our price outlook is. We don't think that's in the interest of our shareholders. But again, we lowered our price outlook primarily due to what we think are the likely lower economic activities due to the global pandemic. No one knows what the recovery will look like, but it's clear that there's been an economic contraction, and it will take some time period to recover. And our products are so closely linked to economic activity.  In terms of debt, we had a very successful bond issuance that we did right after last quarter. It was better than any of our peers in terms of the pricing. And we'll continue to monitor the market. We're in a very strong position. Our commercial paper balances are well below levels, very comfortable levels, but we always look at where the market is and what our liquidity is. And we certainly couldn't go to the bond market and do another issuance if we think it's the right thing to do. Doug Leggate :   Thanks. My follow-up for Jay real quick. Jay, I hate to get a bit, but your comments about Gorgon, can you just elaborate, is this a true bundle [ph] ahead issue? Or what is the remediation that you're anticipating? I'll leave it there. Thanks. A - Jay Johnson : So are you asking about the repair for the vessels? Doug Leggate : Yes. I'm just trying to understand the nature of the problem and what remediation, what options you have for remediation? A - Jay Johnson : It's really just grinding out and replacing a well that has some abnormalities and ensuring that we have the structural and pressure containing capacity that we're looking for. Doug Leggate :   Okay. So no chips under replacement? Pierre Breber :   Sorry. You're breaking up again, Doug? Doug Leggate :   Sorry, no chip bundle replacement required? Pierre Breber : Replacement required? A - Jay Johnson : No, we do not need to replace the vessels. We believe the repairs are going to be fully effective. Doug Leggate : Okay. Thanks a lot, pals. A - Jay Johnson : Thanks, Doug. Operator :   We'll go next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research. Sam, you may have your line muted. I'm sorry, Sam, we're not hearing you. You may have the line muted. Pierre Breber :   Okay. Audra, why don't we go to next question? Operator :   Okay. We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a couple of quick ones. The first one is on TCO. I think, Jay, you mentioned that you used up some of the contingency on timing. But can you talk about how much contingency there is left on cost? And just get a sense around that? And then I have a follow-up on the impairments. Thank you. Jay Johnson : The efficiencies that we saw in our schedule and the gains that we made on schedule were consistent with also gains we are making on cost. But to really tell you where we are, we're going to have to see how we get through this fourth quarter remobilization and sustaining the workforce. So we'll update cost and schedule probably early next year. Pierre Breber : And Biraj, we've said about $1 billion less capital this year. A portion of that is deferral, but about half, but a portion is lower currency effects or currency benefits and higher productivity. So we think some of those cost savings are rolling through. It's not all just deferral. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Understood. And then maybe one for you, Pierre. On the impairments, alongside the lower commodity prices, did you also adjust your expectations on medium-term refining and chems margins? Pierre Breber : There are no impairments. They're all upstream related. So yes, we have -- again, we have various outlooks for upstream and downstream and chemicals margin. But the impairments were all upstream related, and they were -- there was no LNG, no refining mill chemicals. And again, Venezuela is the biggest part of it. There was the price-related impacts and then there were some suspended costs that also were written off. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Understood. Thanks. Operator : Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman at Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the downstream business, specifically, U.S. downstream was particularly weak this quarter. I think even attributing all the timing impacts to the U.S. portion of downstream, it still would have missed, I think, what people were expecting. Can you just talk about some of the challenges you're experiencing, particularly in that part of the business? I'm thinking along the lines of maybe your overindexation to the West Coast was a headwind this quarter and the outlook for that part of the business in the near term? And I have a follow-up. Pierre Breber : Yes. The first thing I'd say is, our execution across upstream and downstream was excellent. I mean, we ran safely and reliably across our upstream and downstream portfolio under very difficult conditions and again extraordinary kind of market conditions. Jason, I referred to our U.S. crude utilization in the second quarter was 55%. Now it's operating higher than that now. Its north of 70% and it's heading towards 80% here in the next couple of weeks. So there were extraordinary contractions. We ran, we matched our supply to our demand. We have sales channels through our retailers and marketers, and we weren't going to -- we were going to meet their demand, but we tried to minimize any build in inventories and try to match, which is very unusual. Obviously, we had to significantly reduce our jet production because the jet reductions were even more significant. So the actual execution we thought was outstanding. It's just -- I don't think the model, frankly, work under the circumstances that we had in the second quarter. We never planned -- I led that business for three years. Nowhere did we ever plan to run at 55% of crude utilization. Nowhere did we plan to make as little jet as we possibly could. So it's really extraordinary conditions. It was all very well executed. But I think when you take the timing effects, margins, which are not entirely transparent across the portfolio. And big volume effect, I think you'll get there. The West Coast, I mean, it just varied. There are times the West Coast was better. There was time the West Coast was worse. I mean, it's -- I wouldn't view it if you look at inventory levels on the West Coast and PADD 5, they're actually below a year ago level. So there was nothing, I think, structural. It was a fast-moving set of circumstances in the second quarter. Different regions were operating at different time periods. Asia, outside the U.S., obviously, held up better in the second quarter. It was more impacted in the first quarter. And that's the kind of nature of operating right now through a global pandemic. And the economic impacts of it. Jason Gabelman : Sure. Thanks. And then the follow-up, the next kind of large project, I guess, in your Q is once TCO ends are the 2 pet chem crackers that have been proposed within the CPChem JV. I think those were deferred from being FID either late this year or early next year, but the FID was pushed out. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about FID-ing those 2 crackers and your overall thoughts about chemicals demand growth given the pandemic? Pierre Breber : Yeah. I mean, well, chemicals demand has held up better than our refined products, and demand is flat to maybe even up a little bit. So there's been some mix effects. Some things are up, some things are down. But overall, pet chem demand has held up pretty well. But as you know, even pre-COVID, margins are weak. There's been a lot of supply at it. So I'll just keep going to capital discipline. And that's really the key for the company and for the industry. It's not just the demand side. We've got to look at the supply side. So we have very competitive projects. They are on the low end of the cost curve. In other words, they can compete, better than almost -- than most others, right? They have very advanced feedstocks. We believe they'll have very low, construction costs. But you're right we are pacing and deferring those decisions, until we get more clarity. We like the business long-term. We'd like to invest in it long-term. But we just have to see where the economy goes and really where industry players go in terms of how disciplined everyone will be about capital investments going forward. Jason Gabelman : Great. Thanks for the time. Wayne Borduin : I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Audra, back to you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir. Wayne Borduin : Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations and on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP of Downstream and Chemicals; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I'll turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Wayne. Third-quarter earnings were about breakeven, improved from last quarter, but reflecting continued challenging market conditions. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Special items totaled $220 million, including a tax charge related to a settlement agreement on asset retirement funding and other items tied to the expiration next August of the Rokan production sharing contract in Indonesia. Free cash flow was almost $2 billion, and the dividend was flat with last quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow from operations improved as commodity prices increased from their lows in the second quarter. Included this quarter was a $265 million cash payment related to the Rokan settlement agreement. Our cash flow dividend breakeven was under $50 Brent due to improved downstream performance and our strong capital and operating cost management. We ended the quarter with a net debt ratio over 17%, well below our competitors. Even after closing the Noble acquisition and stepping up its debt to fair value, we expect to maintain the leading balance sheet among the peer group. We're committed to protecting our financial strength during this ongoing crisis. Turning to the next slide, our 2020 capital spending is trending below our latest guidance. Looking ahead, we expect next year's capital budget to be $14 billion below the combined 2020 guidance from Chevron and Noble, and well below Chevron's five-year guidance from our March Investor Day. Our 2021 capital budget will continue to prioritize investments that drive long-term value and shows the capital flexibility in our portfolio, including assets recently added from Noble. We'll share additional details in December after formal approval. Operating expenditures in the quarter were more than 10% lower than our 2019 quarterly average ahead of our guidance. Turning to Slide 6, relative to the same period last year, third quarter adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to lower realizations and reduced liftings, primarily due to curtailments, partially offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes and margins. The other segment was higher, primarily due to various corporate charges. Turning to Slide 7, compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings increased by about $8 billion, more than half due to the absence of second quarter special items. Adjusted upstream earnings were up almost $2 billion, primarily due to higher liquids realizations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased by over $1 billion, primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins and favorable swings in both timing effects and lower cost to market inventory adjustments at CPChem. The other segment charges decreased primarily due to a favorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation. Turning to production, third quarter oil equivalent production excluding asset sales was 3% lower than a year ago. During the past 12 months, we closed a number of asset sales all signed pre-pandemic. Increased Permian production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and higher turnarounds. The curtailments were in line with our guidance range and reflect mostly OPEC plus reductions in Kazakhstan and Africa and market-driven constraints in Thailand. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Nelson : Thanks, Pierre. As shown on Slide 9, the operating environment has improved from the lows in the second quarter, but it's still challenged. Some products like diesel and petrochemicals have been more resilient during the pandemic, and we've been able to develop new customer channels. Conversely, jet demand has only modestly recovered. The jet demand picture has resulted in weak product margins well below cyclical averages. Since the crisis started, we've been focused on what we can control; safe and reliable operations, cost management, and value chain optimization. In the third quarter, our financial results improved due to strong performance in these areas along with some margin improvement in polyethylene and West Coast fuels. Turning to the next slide. Our focus on cost management is delivering results. The third quarter operating expenses are nearly 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. I'm proud of how our employees have risen to this challenge. Streamlining work processes, reducing contractor costs, and adapting activity levels to a lower-margin environment. Our teams have also delivered on more than 90% of the planned scope of our 2020 turnaround program, deferring only a minor amount of activity. This is a tremendous accomplishment and positions our refinery network to be ready without a backlog when the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels. Optimization activities further reduce the cost of this year's planned work, contributing to lower operating expenses. Turning to the next slide. As always, we're focused on safe and reliable operations keeping our employees safe, being a good neighbor, and delivering the products that the world needs are all part of our license to operate. Since the economic slowdown began, we\u2019ve balanced efficient refinery utilization with the highest margin sales channels for our products. We\u2019ve consistently placed more than 90% of our high-value products into our contracted sales channels despite volatility in demand. This generates the best margins across our value chains. The recent acquisitions of marketing assets in Australia in the Pasadena Refinery in the US Gulf Coast further extends our value chains in those regions, giving us more opportunities to improve profitability and returns. Turning to chemicals, GS Caltex continues to make good progress on their new mixed feed cracker. We expect the project to be under budget and months ahead of schedule. Our local team has done a remarkable job safely progressing the project despite the challenges of COVID-19. At CPChem, we've completed feed at our US Gulf Coast cracker II project and have placed it on hold as we assess market conditions. We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals and the importance of world-scale facilities with access to low cost feedstock. At the same time, any new investment needs to be supported by project economics that will generate strong returns through the price cycle. Also, CPChem began producing circular polyethylene at scale, an industry first in the United States. The production of PE from plastic waste is an important milestone, and it underscores our commitment to finding innovative ways to deliver sustainable products to our customers. Now turning to renewable fuels. The future of energy is lower carbon, and we're delivering more alternative products to our customers. Recently, we announced first gas at our CalBio renewable natural gas joint venture in California and a new partnership with Brightmark. Our capital committed to RNG ventures is over $200 million. In renewable diesel, we are leveraging existing infrastructure to co-process biofeed at our El Segundo Refinery, with startup is expected in the first half of next year. Also, we sell a range of branded biodiesels and are piloting the sale of R99 in Southern California. Through Novvi, we recently announced the first production of renewable base oil at our 500 barrel a day plant in Texas. This leading technology partnership is developing, innovative and sustainable products with future expansion potential. And lastly, our GS Caltex hydrogen testing site in South Korea has opened. The first of its kind in Seoul where customers convergence traditional fuels as well as hydrogen and electricity. All of these efforts align with how we're increasing renewables in support of our business. Part of our approach to the energy transition which Pierre will now further discuss. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mark. We continue to make good progress in our energy transition focus areas. Next year we expect to find $100 million of projects identified with our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve. The MACC tool helps to select the most cost efficient projects to reduce carbon intensity across our operations. As Mark noted, we announced a new joint venture with Brightmark, extending our renewable natural gas portfolio. Finally, in our partnership with Svante, we're pleased to have been awarded a US DOE grant to help fund the construction of a demonstration carbon capture plant in our California upstream operations. The project is expected to start up in 2022. These projects reflect Chevron's commitment to low carbon solutions that are both good for the environment and good for our shareholders. Turning to the next slide, we closed the Noble Energy acquisition earlier this month, and integration is on track. We've completed employee selections at some early quick wins like paying off the revolver and selling its plane and assessment of operational opportunities is well on its way. In the third quarter, Noble generated positive free cash flow primarily due to ongoing capital and cost management and strong sales in the Eastern Med. We're pleased to add Noble assets and welcome it's talented employees to Chevron. Our internal transformation launched late last year is mostly complete with the new organization in place November, 1st. This was an enterprise-wide change effort, the largest since our Texaco merger that modernizes how we work, leveraging digital tools and empowered teams. Lastly, we recently signed an agreement to sell our Appalachia natural gas business. We expect to close the transaction before the end of the year. Now looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we expect Noble production to be lower, primarily due to seasonal demands in the Eastern Med. Curtailments and planned downtime are both lower than last quarter. Production this quarter may include additional cost recovery barrels related to the RioCan settlement. At Gorgon Train 2 well repairs are now complete and we have started commissioning in preparation for LNG production. We expect Train 1 to be taken out of service after Train 2 is back online. At TCO, remobilization continues. We successfully increased the project workforce to near 15,000 and our plans are to end the year with the project team over 20,000. Earlier this week, we completed our final sealift on schedule. All modules are now in Kazakhstan, a significant project milestone. And finally we expect severance payments to lower cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning. I have one upstream question here and one downstream question. Maybe, Mark sort of a downstream question, which is it looked like that the downstream results and particularly refining, surprised relative to our expectations. Was there anything that you would call out here in the third quarter as many of the independent refiners had very tough third quarters including on the West Coast, and just can you then step back and talk about your big picture outlook for the refining sector in that part of your business? Mark Nelson : Thanks for the question, Neil. First, if I step back and look operationally at the third quarter performance overall, I would say that operationally it was first driven by our continued cost management efforts across the downstream chemicals portfolio, much of which is actually focused in our manufacturing sector, also some polyethylene in West Coast fuels margin improvement and then contribution from our lubricants and additives business. Yes, if I step back and look at the refining sector in general, I would say that the pre-pandemic demand shock clearly has retested margin lows. There is not a real analog for the pace of recovery, but the three things are required, I think to have sustainable improved refining margins. First, demand recovery for all high-value products in our materials, we certainly indicated that as an industry we're within 5% to 10% of 2019 motor [ph] gasoline, diesel levels, but the jet is still only half of 2019, and so we need continued recovery there. Second, we need inventory reduction, and we're beginning to see some of that in different parts of the world. And finally, refinery rationalization, and this is the part that's interesting for us because we've rationalized our portfolio over the past decade and we're now seeing competitors start to do that. In some of the regions of the world like Southeast Asia, Australia, and the US Coast, you're hearing people talk about rationalization, which certainly creates an opportunity for us going forward as the supply and demand balance tightens a bit over time. Thanks for the question, Neil. Neil Mehta : Thanks. Thanks, Mark. And then, Pierre a follow-up for you, it's on Gorgon. Where do we stand with Train 2, and what do we know about Train 1 and Train 3 in terms of managing the downtime there? Pierre Breber : Yes. Thanks, Neil. As I said the well repairs are complete. We verified them with non-destructive testing. We've also completed pressure testing of the kettle. So, we're now in the process of getting back online. So, we've started the recommissioning process from the turnaround and the extended turnaround. The next steps are to dry out the systems and then we'll begin cool down. We expect this to take several weeks, which will put first LNG production in the second half of November. In terms of Train 1, as I said, we expect that to be taken down soon after Train 2 is back online. And then we would inspect Train 1 and depending on whether repairs are required or not that will determine how long Train 1 is down, and then sequentially then we would look to Train 3 after that one. Neil Mehta : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll move next to Jeanine Wai at Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning everyone, thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on... Pierre Breber : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. My first question is on sustaining CapEx and the second one is on the upstream with Eastern Med. So the second half 2020 CapEx run rate that's below your multi-year sustaining upstream capital estimate of $10 billion. You've accomplished a lot this year with cost reductions and efficiency improvements. So, my first question is whether there is an update to that $10 billion in sustaining capital number that you provided a few quarters ago, and I know we've got Noble in the mix now too. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jeanine. No, there isn't. I mean the $10 billion is really an estimate, right. It's based on our, again Chevron only, how to sustain production in the short term. Noble gave out an equivalent number around $800 million for that. To be clear, we're not trying to sustain short term production. Mark just talked about we're in an economy that's impacted by pandemic and demand for our products is below normal levels in pre-pandemic levels, and therefore we have oversupplied markets. We are trying to sustain the long-term value of the enterprise. So, if you look to our 2021 capital guidance of $14 billion, it includes an upstream capital of around 11 billion or so sort of higher than the sustaining level, but not all of it is going to short-term production. Some of it is going to long-term production like our project at Tengiz, so we're focused on sustaining long-term value, not short-term production. That's true in combination with Noble, but there is no real update to those numbers. Efficiency improvements are rolling through, but this is an estimate, an analytical estimate that's not so precise that we're going to be updating it frequently. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you. Understood. My second question is on the Eastern Med, could you provide any initial indications or thoughts on how you expect to monetize Leviathan and a lot of the other discovered resource in the area, I guess specifically, do you think that regional demand growth could be strong enough in the medium-term or longer-term to avoid either a greenfield LNG or a pipeline to Europe, and then I guess one more in there, if there is any commentary on the headlines on the pricing dynamics that would be helpful. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Hey, I won't comment on some of the headlines you've read, those are commercial matters that we'll discuss in private with our partners and with our customers. We've had a very smooth transition with our operations in Eastern Med and all across the Noble assets. Our integration is on track. Employee selections in the United States have already happened, we feel really good. We're pleased with the people who are joining us in the Eastern Med included, so Noble employees are top quality and we're very pleased to be welcoming them to Chevron. As you know, it's a good resource. At free cash flow positive, the project has been completed. It's in an area where there is demand opportunities and in particular backing out call, but it's only been a few weeks. So, our focus right now is to have a smooth integration with Noble, we're pleased again with the operations and the free cash flow generation. We're going to work with potential customers, existing customers, future customers to find the most cost-efficient way to develop that resource. There is upside to it and again there is market, but we will determine that all-in time. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Jeanine. Operator : We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Yes, hi, good morning. First question here. If I look at the third quarter, it looks like your Brent based breakeven price is somewhere in the order of $50 a barrel. And if you're talking about this restructuring plan that's been underway and kind of completing here, so I was just curious how you think about the cost side of the equation and the ability to further lower the operating costs and the breakeven moving forward, given that you've given us the capital number here already. Pierre Breber : Yes, the breakeven and again, we would have it a little bit below $50. It's important that it doesn't factor in downstream margins or chemical margins and other parts of our business, which Mark has addressed and those can vary, and they can make a difference obviously on where the breakeven is, I mean margins in that sector are pretty low and as they recover that lowers our breakeven because again it's holding, it's just looking at the oil price and not all the other assumptions. In terms of cost, look our costs were down more than 10%. This quarter, we provided guidance that we expect to end the year on a Chevron-only basis here because fourth quarter will have Noble operating expenses. But if you just looked at Chevron only, we will be down a $1 billion, again we've characterized that as activity related and other actions that we've taken to manage through the pandemic and the crisis that we're in. We've also provided guidance and we've completed our transformation. So we launched that transformation, which is an enterprise-wide restructuring, we started that almost 12 months ago and we just are completing our employee selections right now, it's a tough time for our employees, as they are being notified and will have the new organization in place, November 1. We've talked about $1 billion of OpEx reductions from the transformation. And then finally, we have the Noble synergies and we've talked about $300 million of total Noble synergies, not all of that is operating expense. So all of that is rolling through, we will bring that together for you likely at our Investor Day on any kind of updated guidance, but it's all consistent with your question, which is we're working hard to get our breakeven down. We've sustained our dividend, so the comparisons are consistent and we continue to make progress, both through capital discipline, and cost management to lower our breakeven preserve. Our balance sheet strength right ending the quarter with the leading balance sheet in the industry, and net debt ratio of 17%. That's essentially what we're doing and we'll continue to do it as we're in these challenging times. Phil Gresh : Okay, great. Thank you. My second question would be, just as it relates to 2021 production. Obviously, you gave us a CapEx number here, on the last call you talked about the Permian potentially declining high single-digit rate year-over-year in '21 on an organic basis, obviously, you're layering in Noble here, so I didn't know if maybe you could provide any early read on '21 production, whether it's standalone or pro forma or if not a hard number, maybe some moving pieces around it. Pierre Breber : Yes, we'll provide our production guidance as we normally do. That will be on our fourth quarter call at the end of January. We did provide guidance for the fourth quarter. So we do a quarter ahead. I think you've hit some of the pieces there. Again, I would add the Rokan PSC exploration, which I referred to and we had a settlement agreement, which is a really good agreement that ensures the uncertainty around the funding for abandonment and adds a little drilling activity to keep production managed heading into that contract expiration, but that's going to be in August of 2021, so I'll point that out. And again our efforts at Permian, which Jay talked about is a potential decline of 6% to 7% if we stay at those activity level. So I don't really have more to say Phil to you. We'll provide that guidance when we finalize our plans, get formal approval of our capital budget and we'll do it at our regular time during the fourth quarter earnings call. Phil Gresh : Okay, thank you. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Next, we'll move to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wayne Borduin : Hi, Devin. Devin McDermott : Hey. So the first one I wanted to ask on is actually around some of the latest investments and momentum you made on emissions reductions and there's been some positive announcements here over the last few months and I think the disclosure on this marginal abatement cost curve is interesting and that it shows there is opportunities to potentially reduce emissions while also boosting returns of the negative plan cost of carbon that you have there. The question specifically as we think about over the next few years here, any sense of the depth of opportunities where you can actually have this nice win-win of driving down cost, while also reducing carbon intensity. And then as you think about planning longer-term, any intention of expanding your emission production goals that already exist perhaps post-2023 in the Paris Climate like some of your peers have done and just how you're thinking about that longer-term? Pierre Breber : Sure. On the second question, as you said, we have four carbon intensity reduction metrics, they go out to 2023, 2023 was chosen because that's the first stocktake date under the Paris agreement and so we're aligned with those. We are the only company, first company, only company in our sector to do it on an equity basis, many do on an operatorship basis and then we do oil and gas metrics separately because they serve a different market. So the $100 million that you're referring to is, it's something that we expect will be recurring. So we see opportunities for a number of years to be able to invest that kind of expenditure and achieve what we'll call cost-efficient carbon reductions. But if I because -- and yes, will we extend at some point in time, I think, yes, the answer is yes, it would be logical for us to go to the next Paris stocktake date, but we're right now focused on delivering on those 2023 targets. We also have those as part of the incentive pay almost all every Chevron employee. So we're making good progress on that. But I would think, all of our energy transition activities, and Mark referred to a number in his business. They really support making our business more sustainable in a lower carbon future and they do it in a way where we earn return. So the renewable natural gas that Mark was talking about also generates returns. And then of course then we're looking at some of the new technologies and those obviously are at a different stage of maturity. So we're taking a number of actions that we believe address climate change, that lowers carbon and does it in a way that's good for the environment and good for our shareholders. Devin McDermott : Right, that makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is on the portfolio composition, post the Noble transaction. So you recently executed on the Appalachia sale, you're doing a good job under the kind of pruning the portfolio in investing the non-core assets over time. As we look forward here post this transaction, any updated thoughts on further opportunities for the best features and whether or not space as part of the question if you could address things like Noble Midstream or anything within our portfolio that might be non-core. And then lastly, whether not as part of the Noble transaction guaranteeing Noble's outstanding debt is part of what your vision. Pierre Breber : Okay, Devin, I got the asset sales, what was the question about Noble debt at the end? Devin McDermott : Whether or not that will be guaranteed by Chevron? Pierre Breber : All right, thanks. Well, let me just address Noble -- Noble debt. We're reviewing options, we haven't made a decision and again will notify bondholders when we make that decision and you should expect that in the next couple of months. In terms of asset sales, we are on track to complete the program that we talked about it was 2018 to 2020, a three year program of $5 billion to $10 billion and before tax proceeds. We expect to close our US natural gas sale here before year-end and when we complete that will be right in the middle of that range. In terms of what else is in the public domain, the most significant ownership interest that we've talked about is selling our interest in North West Shelf and that's the commercial matter and we just -- we won't comment on, but I guess I would just say, we're in a different place than many of our competitors, right. Mark referred to the rationalization we've done on our refining network over the last decade and even before, I referred to the number of asset sales that we've completed in the last 12 months. You saw that in our production chart, all of that where signed pre-pandemic at good values. Obviously, we just bought a bunch of a, sorry, a company that comes with high-quality assets and I won't comment on any specific assets in the Noble portfolio. So we are very value-driven. The gas assets that we have that we're planning to close here before the year-end and our interest in North West Shelf held up better in this post-pandemic world. Also, if you think of North West Shelf, it's more almost like an infrastructure investment as the resource behind the plant comes down and it becomes more of a tolling facility going forward. So you'll continue to see us to be disciplined in how we manage our portfolio. I would not expect us to have any kind of big program announcement, we'll have the ongoing portfolio rationalization that's been part of the Chevron approach to management for a long time. Devin McDermott : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Pierre Breber : Hi, Paul. Paul Cheng : Yes, thank you. Two questions, I think one is for Mark and one is for Pierre. Pierre, what would be a reasonable allocation of future capital in the Neil, we know about low carbon initiative and two, let's assume that at some point, you probably will set up a target to be net carbon zero on at least one [ph] scoop one or two, maybe over the next 15 years, 20 years. Do you need other new businesses like some of your peers go into, the renewable power business in order to achieve that? So that's the first question. The second question is for Mark. If I look at over the last couple of quarters. One of the big performance differences between you guys in the US comparing to your customers in Europe, they have far stronger Downstream results, mainly because of their marketing assets and also their trading operation. On that basis, do you think for Chevron that is the why rest of P, so that you may want to further boost your marketing? I mean you've been selling down your marketing assets both at the past 10 plus years. And for trading historically, you guys took out a facilitation call center, while your European peers are looking at the 4% [indiscernible] around the asset. So is that the right approach for you or that you don't think is fit for you. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Okay. Paul, I'll start. Look, we're going to be disciplined with our capital, that's true in our conventional business and you've seen that with the announcement of our organic capital budget that's true and our acquisitions, you saw that when we walked away from Anadarko and collected a billion dollar termination fee. And I think you've seen that and how we executed the Noble transaction being the first to announce and complete that as acquisition and it's going to be true in energy transition there. No one in Chevron has an open checkbook and, again that's true in our conventional business, that's true in our M&A, and that's true in energy transition. What you have seen is investments now that are on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, we talked about $100 million into our marginal driven cost, curve investments $200 million in renewable natural gas. So the investments really are limited by what we believe or reflect what we believe are the opportunities that are again good for the environment, address climate change and good for our shareholders. In terms of, do we need to adopt this change in strategy, I think we've been pretty clear that we're not going to diversify away or divest from our core business. The actions we're taking around the energy transition are geared to making these businesses that are good businesses that play an important role in society and making them more sustainable in a lower carbon future. So I think you should expect us to continue to do that. We are going to operate in businesses where we have a competitive advantage, where we have a value proposition for shareholders that is advantage relative to other alternatives and again we're going to do that in a way that is part of a lower apartment future. So, maybe we'll go to Mark on the downstream question. Mark Nelson : Thanks for the question, Paul. On the marketing question, we've consistently indicated that we are interested in strengthening our value chains. In fact, you could say that here in the third quarter that we've demonstrated the benefit of linking our refinery production to higher margin product placement and that's kind of our view of the value chain and I could -- I would suggest that the recent coolant transaction is an example of us strengthening our value chain in Asia, where we have essentially added terminals in retail stations in Australia where we can now place our Asian joint venture refinery production in a very strong market, where we own the strongest brand and we acquired that on June 30 and it's first three months and it's working just as we would have expected. So I think that goes to the concept of strengthening our value chain. To your comment on the trading portion of our portfolio, our trading businesses is designed first to ensure that we flow product, second that we optimize around those value chains and then we trade in those areas where we have demonstrated considerable expertise and it's vital to our downstream business, they are critical partners with regard to how we run our business and make those value chains work and they continue to look for opportunities to increase their impact. So I appreciate the question because the way we think about our value chains is important to us. Pierre Breber : Okay. I'll just add, I think our shareholders support our approach to trading because I think they understand the other risk and volatility that can come to trading earnings and it generally attracts a little multiple because of that, in particular in a resource company, Paul, thanks for your questions. We appreciate it. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark, maybe I could take advantage of you being on the call. I just wonder if you could offer some perspectives on how you see this bottoming process of the downstream cycle playing out. What same process are you seeing in any of your markets in terms of any green shoots or any expectations that are going to be here for a while and I guess what's behind my question is, is Chevron totally done with rationalization in your downstream portfolio? Mark Nelson : Well, I think it's a thoughtful question, you've given the unique situation. We're in the -- If I go back to the question, Neil asked about it relates to margins in general. I mentioned three things that we have to see to feel like we are on a path for greater sustainable margins in the downstream business, and it is that demand recovery for all high value products and you can see some of those things happening in our Asian markets where we see Australia past it's 2019 levels and we see certain Southeast Asian markets going beyond their levels and with our strong brand, we've been able to go past industry rates of growth in some of our areas. So I think those are opportunities that will help us on the demand side of the equation. The inventory reduction, I think the industry has demonstrated over time that we'll work through that, but that will take a little bit of time. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, the refinery rationalization as an industry, while we've done the predominance of our rationalization, we're always looking at strengthening the value chains in which we've chosen to compete and we'll continue to look at that over time, but the green shoot, I would say is the amount of companies that are announcing, suggested rationalizations and I think if those come through we might see getting to those recovered margins sooner than maybe -- we would naturally expect, we will presume that. We will stay focused on the self-help side of the equation and things that we can control like lowering our operating costs, certainly running efficiently with the desired yields and then using data analytics to place and price our products. So, we'll focus on what we can control. But we're hoping at some of those green shoots actually come to fruition. Doug Leggate : Thank you. My follow-up is, for Pierre, if I may. Pierre, just some clarification on the CapEx, what is the cash CapEx number and related given the headcount reduction, and so on, what should we think as apples for apples operating cost reductions as we look at '21 versus '20, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Yes. So again, we'll give all the details on our capital program when it's formally approved, but a cash equivalent excluding affiliates of about $10 billion is a good number to use right now. Well, I'm not sure I can say much more on OpEx, OpEx I think Devin asked that question, again, we have $1 billion of reductions we've seen this year, a 1 billion that we'll see next year through transformation, Noble synergies and as I said, we'll put that all together and provide some guidance here in the first quarter. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Doug. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question is from Paul Sankey from Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Morning, everyone. Can you hear me? Pierre Breber : Yes. We hear you, Paul. Paul Sankey : Hi. You've talked about your industry-leading balance sheet and we've seen some incredible deterioration in values around various other oils, even globally. In terms of acquisitions, I assume that you're now very happy with your Permian position it feels as it's difficult to find anything that would improve your position. Can you talk a little bit about that and I assume that you don't want to add debt without there being a compelling opportunity, which I assume that kind of isn't globally, it just seems that you're in such a strong competitive position, I wonder if you're thinking about actually doing some more deals? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Paul. Look, we're focused on integrating Noble's successively and we're off to a really good start. I also talked about our transformation again as enterprise wide restructuring that we've been working on for almost a year now and will go in effect November 1 and so those are really our priorities. As we've said, we have a high bar for M&A and Noble cleared that bar and so it's quality assets, it meets our criteria of quality assets at a good value at the right time. I'm just not going to speculate about future M&A. If I do talk about our financial priorities, I mean, I think we've been pretty consistent and clear on what they are, to sustain and grow the dividend. We've done that for three straight years, invest to support long-term value and we're doing that in organic program and of course, we've done that through our Noble acquisition and maintain a strong balance sheet, which we've been able to do with a net debt ratio of 17.5%. In terms of the Permian, I think when you think you said it very well, we have a leading position, Noble provides a nice bolt-on, again our M&A is not focused necessarily on the Permian, it's focused on assets that are accretive to our shareholders, that are good value for our shareholders that add quality assets. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Paul. Pierre Breber : Any follow-up, Paul Sankey : I do actually, it's totally different subject. Could you talk about your OpEx curtailments and anything you can add on the neutral zone? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Yes, in terms of the neutral zone, the production was about 30,000 barrels a day, our share in the third quarter. So that start-up is going well. In terms of our curtailments overall, the guidance we provided was about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent. So that's oil and gas equivalent and the majority of that is OPEC plus related. So 80% and 90% of that is OPEC plus related and that's again in countries like Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Angola. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Paul. Paul Sankey : Just quickly, where you are headed on the neutral zone, just quickly, well go to? Mark Nelson : We haven't provided any guidance. We're focused on continuing to have a safe and gradual ramp-up. So again we are at near 30,000 barrels a day Chevron share and we'll update you at year-end. Paul Sankey : Thank you, sir. Mark Nelson : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria at RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had was on just a clarification on TCO, the co-lending figure has gone down in the last couple of successive quarters. Is it safe to assume given you had issues mobilizing the workforce that's missing from 2020 just gets pushed 2021, that will be the first question? Mark Nelson : Yes, so there are two parts to that. I mean, let me just address TCO project spending is about down 1 billion or share this year relative to what we had planned, in part due to the demobilization, but we've said about half of that are true cost efficiency savings and about half will be deferred to next year and future years. That's sort of related to the lending, but not entirely right. The lending is also dependent on dividend policy and prices, but you're correct that you've seen that the lending has come down, our guidance on it has come down during the course of the year, which is again a combination of lower project spending, but also where prices have gone. Biraj Borkhataria : Got it. Makes sense. And then the second question on a slightly different topic. But when you're looking at project sanctions and just in the context of your kind of energy transition approach, do you currently assume a carbon price even where countries themselves do not have a sort of fiscal framework in place, and if so can you kind of tell us what the carbon price you're using as? Pierre Breber : Yes, we don't disclose our price forecast for oil and gas prices, we think it's commercially sensitive. We don't disclose our carbon price forecast. We look at it under a variety of scenarios for both commodity prices and carbon pricing and we look at it by jurisdiction because it can vary, the investments that Mark referred to, certainly they are our policy supported, so they generate in some cases, low carbon fuel credits or Renewable Fuel Standard, the federal standard. And so again. It really varies by jurisdiction. We are looking at returns, again, we're trying to make investments in energy transition that are both good for the environment and good for shareholders and some of that return is policy enabled, but it really does vary by jurisdiction. Wayne Borduin : Thanks Biraj. Biraj Borkhataria : Thank you Pierre. Thanks Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Thank you. Good morning. Pierre Breber : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Yes. Two questions I have for you. The first. I know you said all the modules are in Kazakhstan now but any more update you can provide like how many people are actually able to muster to the site and kind of thought process as we head into the typically slower winter season for what this might imply for budgetary and timeframe of a start-up on the next pages. Pierre Breber : Yes. Thanks, Roger. Look the remobilization is going well and I said we're near 15,000 of workforce on the project and we're heading to end the year above 20. So far our safeguards are working well, we've kept the rate of infection, very low and we're seeing our work progress in line with expectations. So the key for us going forward to holding cost and schedule is to complete the remobilization, sustain a full workforce during the pandemic using our safeguards and achieve our progress milestone. So we're -- as you say, we're in the, I would say early days. We're in the middle of the remobilization, we're heading into winter, we need to see how this all progresses and we'll know more by our Investor Day, and we plan to provide an update there. Having all material and modules, on the ground is a really important milestone. It doesn't mean that we are now can just address all of the work in place and so that's -- those are really the keys for us going forward in terms of again maintaining cost and schedule. Roger Read : Okay, great. And then a quick unrelated follow-up, what could, as you look across your various operations leave Noble out of this, but when it comes, getting everybody's pad drilling. Just curious if you see anything in the way of decline rates that are either better or worse than what you would have anticipated thinking whether it's Permian or The Gulf of Mexico or just International. Pierre Breber : The short answer is no, we're not seeing any surprises. I mean the Permian, is a little bit higher than our early guidance if you recall at our market response press release, I think it was March 24 to March 25, we guided to the exit rate on the Permian being down 20%, it will be a little bit better than that. So our production in the Permian was 565,000 barrels oil equivalent. We think our exit rate that's a Chevron only. We think our exit rate will be around 550 and again that's a little better than we had guided to back in March. Now we'll have the Noble Permian production on top of that, that's about 50. So we expect to be near 600. So we're managing, again we're sustaining, we are managing declines very well. We are not putting a lot of capital to add short-term production because of oversupplied markets, but we're pleased with how we're operating upstream just like Mark has talked about safe and reliable operations, we're seeing the same on our upstream operations. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Roger. Roger Read : Great, thanks. Operator : We'll move next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you. Wayne Borduin : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : My question is about your renewable gas business. If you look at the California Air Resource Board carbon intensity scores, actually, when I first saw it, I thought it was a mistake because renewable gases like a negative 400 or something, totally off the charts. I guess you're constrained by the CNG market, which I don't know how big it is, but given the emissions benefits of this product, are you able to offset all or at least a significant amount of your obligations from the refining business under the LCFS. Mark Nelson : Hey, Sam, this is Mark. Thank you. Thank you for the question and the kind of recognition of why we would be considering the renewable natural gas as part of our value chain. I mean we should expect us to be a strong player in the RNG space and policy enabled markets like the West. As you've indicated, it is the most cost and carbon efficient fuel from an LCFS and RFS perspective and it's actually low execution risk and so it leverages our strength, our ability to partner with folks, especially the feedstock side and then our ability to place the product, we've got to your second element that you need to put this over time and so we're excited about the CalBio and the CalBio and even the adopter ports announcements that we've made, and I think you'll see us continue to wisely grow here. Wayne Borduin : Thanks for the questions. Sam Margolin : Sure. Okay. And I mean, I guess just it's a related follow-up. But one of the things that you've said that I think is differentiated from a corporate level is that you manage your capital planning not really on the basis of prices, but on how you see the demand outlook shaking out or directionally because you know the price can change and it might not necessarily reflect actual conditions, but so in light of that, you mentioned that we're transitioning to a low carbon world. Some things could change depending on the election, but can this renewable gas business if there really is market share to be had, can it scale beyond California, what other geographic footprints are out there for you and basically just in terms of scope what are you thinking here. Mark Nelson : Yes, the short answer is growth is clearly plausible. We tend to look at this in regard to our existing value chains, where we have our strengths and where we can execute well and we'll consider growth in that context, but there is certainly upside potential. Sam Margolin : Okay, thank you so much. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Sam. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Sam. Operator : Next we'll go to Manav Gupta at Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : Thank you for taking my question. You have two high-class refining assets in California and we saw that the earnings are stronger in the downstream as Neil pointed out, the governor over there is indicating that he wants to ban the internal combustion engine in 2035, the sale of new vehicles, is that any way changing the way you plan your business in California, or you think that he does not have the legal authority as many legal experts are pointing out. Mark Nelson : Well, thanks for the -- thank you for the question. I'm actually a native of California when I think about California, I think of generally under normal conditions, a very strong economy and a tremendous desire for affordable mobility. And with that backdrop for the foreseeable future, to be successful in California from a fuels perspective, I think you have to have reliable refineries, a strong brand to both the place the product and to keep a connection with the customer and an ability to participate in California's lower-carbon future. And we've been here in California, for over 100 years and I think we are well positioned to engage with the government to build a path towards a lower carbon future and we will actively participate that and believe we can do so. Manav Gupta : Okay. A quick follow-up is, you have had two Noble assets for about a month is, are there any upside surprises, thoughts like synergies that you think you can do better on any integration, you think you can do better on since you acquired those assets. Mark Nelson : Yes, thanks Manav. Look it is going very well and again we're pleased to have been the first to announce a transaction and to complete it, it's a good fit, and I won't go through all of that, again, a very successful first month. Synergies are on track, we expect that there will be more as we operate as one company. In the first few weeks, we've been able, for example, to see contracts and look at procurement opportunities. We're also starting to see operational synergies, we'll update you sometime in the first quarter, just let us, give us some time to fully assess the opportunities. We expect the synergy number to be higher. I don't have a number for you. We're going to do that work and will advise you in due course. Manav Gupta : Thank you. Operator : We take our next question from Jason Gabelman at Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yes, hey, I wanted to circle back to this Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, which it seems like a useful framework to use moving forward. Two kind of related questions on it, one does this enables you to kind of get to net zero by 2030, it seems like your European peers are pushing towards that and I'm assuming the US is going to ultimately face pressure to hit net zero on its own emissions by 2030. And do you have any sense of what you'd be able, what do you need to spend to achieve that now that you have this kind of cost curve model and does Algonquin, the partnership with Algonquin, how does that kind of figure into this, I think you've been a partner with them for a couple of quarters, just wondering if that unlocks some of the opportunities within the goal of reducing carbon intensity? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yes, Jason, look we support the Paris Agreement and as Mark says, we're going to be part of the lower carbon energy future. Our focus is on results not pledges. And so what you're seeing at our actions today and that are addressing carbon intensity, I'm just not going to get further. We have our 2023 carbon intensity metrics I referred to earlier that we're likely to update those in time to get them the next stock take periods, but our approach again is really focused on delivering results that we think address climate change and are good for the environment. In terms of Algonquin, it's early days, but yes, we see opportunities there, that does both, right, it sort of increases renewables and support of our business. You've seen us do that in the Permian and in Bakersfield with wind and solar projects that are providing power to our operations that we otherwise are buying off the grid and Algonquin is working on opportunities in other areas of Chevron operations. It does take a little bit of time. Yes, I do some of the engineering work in the development work, but so far that joint venture is going well. Jason Gabelman : All right. And just a clarification, I appreciate on slide 9 you included downstream earnings excluding timing effects, which is definitely useful, was that a disclosure you plan on including going forward and 3Q '20 does imply kind of no timing effects this quarter, just looking at where the graph, where the bar is on the graph. Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yes, Jason. So in the very, the last slide in the appendix, you see that we actually give the absolute timing effects for US International Downstream. So for a long time, we've been showing the variance. But as you said, you can figure out the absolutes in each quarter. So now we've shown that for going back to 2017. And, Yes, you should expect us to continue to do that going forward. Jason Gabelman : Great. That's helpful, thanks a lot. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jason. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Jason. Operator : We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov at Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking my question. You do not have a massive footprint in Europe compared to just about all the other supermajors, but I am curious, your thought on another regulatory issue, the European Climate law, getting ready to be passed five weeks from now and what the impact on your upstream and or Downstream operations might be? Pierre Breber : Well, as you say Pavel although we've operated in Europe upstream and downstream for many decades and I worked there in Aberdeen when the first carbon tax was enacted. We sold the majority of our upstream operations, we have a little non-op position still, and again no large-scale refining or marketing. We do have some lubricants and additives businesses in there. So I think again we support the Paris accord, we believe the future of energy is lower carbon, we expect more policy. I think it gets to what Mark was trying to, was addressing is getting the balance between those worthwhile policy goals and providing affordable reliable energy that the world economies need. Pavel Molchanov : Two quick follow-ups, since we're a week ahead of the election. Can you remind us on the combined Chevron but Noble, Permian acreage position? How much of the acreage is federal? Pierre Breber : Yes, it's about 10% is federal in terms of total Permian acreage. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Pavel. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Dingman at Trust Securities. Neil Dingmann : Good morning -- afternoon now, guys. I was hoping just you've talked a lot about these details on the renewables, but my question was more particularly on the Novvi partnership, I'm just wondering, again on that out of your facilities, can you talk about maybe some details on what industries you all might target once that starts rolling out of that facility? Pierre Breber : Well, so the concept for our downstream business is to provide a renewable base oil to round out our base oil offering both for our own business and for the business of others, the product itself, which is a technology partnership between ourselves leveraging our ISODEWAXING technology and some other patented solutions allows us to create, to take multiple types of bio feedstocks internally into what I would consider higher-performing base oils. There are other applications, even in cosmetics and things like that, that will be investigated over time, but we do see an opportunity for expansion of that joint venture should be as economics continue to warranted. Thank you. Thanks for the question. Neil Dingmann : Sure. And then one maybe just quick follow-up on that, it was you certainly are doing a great job of continuing to move not only Novvi but CalBioGas and just continue to move in the renewables in general. Do you all have sort of any target or kind of metrics on where you would like to be as far as what you think renewables might be is a part of your potential total part of your business, two or three years from now, or is it just too early to determine that? Mark Nelson : I'll give the first answer on this, then maybe Pierre can build on this. I think it's too early for us to say about how big it could become. But we do intend to continue to grow it as part of our -- as part of our business. I think we can do that successfully. While we return -- while we improve returns as well. Pierre, would you add anything. Pierre Breber : Yes, this was well said. So again, I think I addressed earlier. No one has an open checkbook in Chevron to spend money on, that's true in the conventional business and acquisitions and energy transition. We're going to pursue the opportunities that are good for the environment, good for our shareholders, and it will grow over time. Wayne Borduin : Thanks, Neil. Neil Dingmann : Thanks for your time guys. Wayne Borduin : We've got through all the questions in the queue. And I want to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Audra, back to you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir. Wayne Borduin : Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. Also listening in today is Roderick Green, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations who will assume the position effective April 1. Roderick and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of months. It has been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last three years. Thank you for your excellent questions, transparent feedback and investments in Chevron. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Wirth : All right. Thanks, Wayne. 2020 was an unprecedented year. The global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong position and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged. During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of these five commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides. First and foremost, we focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions. Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible, even though just weeks before jet was the fastest-growing refined product. Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for essential workers in a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees how they carried out the responsibilities with excellence and help each other in during this extraordinary year rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges. Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was flexible. Just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019. Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well below our revised guidance of $14 billion. We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1 billion this year, with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel, and incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and a key to winning in this industry. Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet, while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares. When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our three-year high-grading program in the middle of our guidance range. Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future. Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained capital for projects that we expect t deliver production and attractive cash flow for years, like our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved the capability to build investment back up when the conditions are right. In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition showing the way with a low premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way, with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already over-supplied markets, offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital investments and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs. Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long-term, that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment. Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance to a lower carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plants and investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up, Blue Planet. We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent and equitable manner. We maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supported relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an unprecedented year to meet the interests of all our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We reported a net loss of $700 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings were about break-even. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil cash break-even price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets. Full-year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions, as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near zero. We remain committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor Day in March. Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a net debt ratio in the low 20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step-up to market value. Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased, primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity prices. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end of the year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses primarily due to turnarounds and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to lumpsum elections. Turning to our full-year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings.  Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes than margins, unfavorable timing effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension expense. Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021. Our projected growth is driven by a full-year production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part due to lower capital last year, price effects and accounting change in Venezuela, 2020 asset sales and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new investments. Now, looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround. At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair and inlet separator. We do not expect production impacts in the second quarter. The impact from ongoing OPEC plus curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next month, we expect to resume re-mobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. One-time pre-funding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse the third quarter. In downstream, turnaround activity in the first quarter is expected to have an estimated after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance items are shown on the slide. With that, back to Mike for his closing comments. Mike Wirth : All right, thanks, Pierre. 2020 was a year like no other. And while there are uncertainties and challenges ahead, we are optimistic about the future. We are stronger with Noble, which adds geographic diversity and plays to our strengths. We're starting the year with an industry-leading balance sheet again. We are executing a disciplined investment program that grows enterprise value with greater capital efficiency. We remain committed to our number one financial priority, sustaining and growing the dividend, and we're advancing a lower carbon future with actions that are good for the environment and good for shareholders. We hope that you'll join us on March 9 to discuss these topics and more during our 2021 Chevron Investor Day. With that, I'll turn it back to Wayne. Wayne Borduin : Thanks Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Devin McDermott at Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first one I had here was just on the capital allocation strategy as we think about the next few years and you put the release out back in December cutting the capital budgeted over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending in Kazakhstan rolls off, you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico, how you're thinking about that U.S. concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies? Mike Wirth : Yes. Thanks, Devin. Look, there is a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility, and we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just nine months last year because we could flex that downward. And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, the production will be somewhere between flat and up 3%. So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been some of the first places to draw that capital back. As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad, but it also lacked some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new administration comment as they introduced this and answered some questions, I think, they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations. Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas, more so the New Mexico, we're weighted toward private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there. And that remains a highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions support it. So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements. At deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that we're advancing here and there has been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure and we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed. But there are questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through. So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico, that was probably the lower part of the capital step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it, but stay tuned, we'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward and, of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important, too. Just bear in mind, if conditions in the U.S. become so onerous, that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars. Devin McDermott : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is just on TCO and Kazakhstan, I was wondering if you could give us just an update on progress there and how things are progressing versus your expectations? Mike Wirth : Yes. So quickly, I'll reiterate that, last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded into site. That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished that. Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We plateaued at that number now, because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same wintertime uptick in Coronavirus cases as you're seeing around the world. And so we - we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain periods of time. We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that hasn't been done over the last - going on a year now as this has been impacting us. And so we're working on optimizing schedules and work plans and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's hard to quantify that until we really are back at work, and certainly in the wintertime, things tend to slowdown, summertime, they will pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up and we will keep you advised as to what that looks like. Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in six weeks, and he will give you more detail at that point in time. I don't believe by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a highly reliable specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that and we will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful. Devin McDermott : Great. Thank you so much. Mike Wirth : You bet. Operator : We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. Mike Wirth : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : The first question, the 2021 production guidance, the high end growth of 3% is slightly below where consensus is here. And you gave some color there on Gorgon and Wheatstone for the first quarter, which was very helpful. So I guess is it fair to assume that the extent of the downtime at Gorgon and Wheatstone that's in your guidance is just kind of what's in the first quarter? And just maybe any color on what you're factoring in for the Permian as well for 2021? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yes, I mean, the first thing I'll say, Phil, and I know everybody looks at production, but it's an outcome, and we're running the company to deliver financial results and we let the production be what it is. Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone, Wheatstone for the rest of the year should be back up to full capacity until the turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we had already planned and announced. And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a plan to turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. So we will be lighter on Australia production, then where everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity and then there is an increment related to these repairs. In the Permian, there's two pieces to think about. Overall Permian production will be up because we've added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy production, that actually today looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020, and that's with flat activity levels running five rigs and one or two completion crews over the course of the year, and a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV, seven gross, our share about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what Non-Operated JV partners do. But those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production. Pierre Breber : And Phil, I'll just add that Venezuela year-on-year is downright. We changed our accounting midyear last year to where we're no longer booking production and reserves associated with those operations. We do continue to have curtailments this year, which is also factored in. Australia year on year is not a big variance, it's flat to modestly down. Again, we operated a big portion of 2020 with the Train down at Gorgon. So that's not a big driver of the year-on-year change. Phil Gresh : My follow-up would just be on capital allocation. Balance sheet, obviously still looks very strong Pierre, you said your dividend coverage is below $50 Brent I think for a second straight quarter and that's despite downstream still being soft. So with oil here in the 50s, I think some people are maybe little surprised, you didn't increase your dividend the other day recognizing we're still in the midst of a pandemic, but just any thoughts you could share around capital allocation if oil does indeed stay here in the 50s? Mike Wirth : Yes, well, a couple of things maybe in response to it, Phil. Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off, in total, the global economy is functioning at below its capacity and I think there is uncertainty out there. And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market and so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is still underway, and so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment and there could be some downside risk. So all that said, maybe two other points, one, well, for the last three years, we announced a dividend increase in the first quarter, if you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase. It actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend increase would occur, it's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions, affordability et cetera. And it's a Board decision and the Board reviews that every quarter. So I hope our words have been more our actions over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders that the dividend is our number one priority. We have not changed that, others have, others have made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest, we have not. And we were guided through this by those financial priorities and we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock, and that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward. Last comment to your hypothesis. If we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint, our breakeven is in the 40s and so we'd be free cash flow positive and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase. Operator : Next we'll move to Jeanine Wai at Barclays. Jeanine Wai : And I'd also like to congratulate Wayne and thanks for putting up for - with all of us for so many years. Thanks. My first question is again on shareholder returns. Chevron's prior $19 billion to $22 billion medium-term CapEx range, I believe that was based on $60 Brent and it left room for about $5 billion a year of buybacks. So can you talk about how your updated 2022 to 2025 CapEx guidance - how, if we should think that range still also leaves room for ratable annual buybacks? Mike Wirth : Well, it'd be a function Jeanine primarily commodity price, right. So we've outlined that budgeted premised on a lower price than $60 because we've been through this pandemic. And we expect only a gradual recovery in the global economy, which would support gradual recovery in commodity prices. So we've prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year. If - and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels and so we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price environment that supports that. The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise which is disciplined capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talk about within our priorities. So we'll lay out a little more detail on this in March for you so that you can understand what this would look like under different price scenarios and how we might allocate capital, the flexibility we'd have for capital distributions under different price scenarios. So stay tuned for more discussion in March. Jeanine Wai : We'll stay tuned for that. My second question is on the energy transition, I guess how does the current extremely low cost of capital for energy transition projects, energy transition companies, how does that impact your view on the speed of the transition and the potential to create lots of capacity that's potentially uneconomic, but nonetheless, it still erodes oil and gas demand. So I guess your views on that and how can Chevron compete in that type of environment? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yes. So certainly, this is a space that's getting a lot of love from investors right now and you see it in EV start-ups, you see it in solar start-ups, you see it in a lot of different technologies. And look, we're supportive of all of the above, we want to see advancements and growth in renewables. We expect a lower carbon energy system in the future. I think you put your finger on one things that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when the day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's - we hope that they can and we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon. The last thing - I'm not sure that necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe or oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe, a lot of it is going into power that displaces coal, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time and actually requires natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability, and so there is not necessarily a one for one displacements on all of these investments and that requires thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy. Operator : And our next question comes from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, thanks for taking some time this morning and let me congratulate Wayne as well and I appreciate the time and friendship over the years. Let me kick it off here on downstream. When we think about our model, upstream did okay, downstream was a clear miss relative to our projections and it's not surprising just given how tough demand was in the fourth quarter, we are seeing cracks move in the right direction with line of sight to OPEC barrels coming back into the market, do you guys envision a downstream ahead and how do you think about your refining configuration to capture that? Mike Wirth : Yes. So you're right. Downstream conditions have still been tough demand is off, it's off differentially across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system and then it's - the amount that is off varies quite a bit regionally, right. So in China, things are back to normal, by and large, other parts of Asia, pretty darn close. Europe, North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the world and refining markets are regional and they are interconnected globally. But fundamentally they start out regionally. So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year. But I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's, again it's a gradual process and we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia and so in Asia things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they are still recovering. So I think, downstream in 2021, I would expect to be better than it was in '20, but we're not anticipating pre-pandemic downstream earnings and performance of this year. Pierre Breber : Neil, if I can just give a little more on the fourth quarter, I made a reference to this year-end inventory adjustment. I'll just explain that, it was more than $100 million, so during the course of the year you're costing inventory at average cost of the commodities. At year end, you see if you've built or drove relative to prior year layers, and so the good news is we drew, we took our inventory levels down, so good management of working capital, but we drew into prior year layers that were higher costed and so that's only something we do at year end in the fourth quarter. You don't - you're not doing it during the year, because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarters. So you don't want to be always doing this calculation, but our practice is at year end, we revalue that, so you have - think of it as inventory that had been valued at $42 during the course of the year, when we go into prior year layers, we're picking it up at $60 or $70. There is no cash impact. But there is a one-time kind of P&L effect. We don't call it a special item because it happens every year. It just happened this year, but through good inventory management, we actually drew down in the prior year layers, which were higher costed. Neil Mehta : Thanks Pierre. That makes ton sense. My follow-up is, you guys acquired Noble towards the bonds of cycle. Mike, you've built a reputation as being a good deal maker and been willing to walk away when the bid-ask goes the wrong way. Do you still see it as a buyers' market out there, and do you still see attractive opportunities, whether it's U.S. E&P or elsewhere in the portfolio? Mike Wirth : So it's still a tough market, and you would say that in general, I would say both companies and asset valuations are down from where they've historically been. So there is opportunity in circumstances like that and we've got the capacity to consider doing things. We may have passed the bottom; hopefully, we have from the standpoint of commodity and other cycles here. And we're alert to opportunities, it may be that as companies come back in terms of their equity valuation, there's still a lot of people that are carrying a fair amount of debt and have indicated a desire to sell assets in order to repair their own balance sheets. So we could see a market where there are more asset sellers than there are buyers which could offer some opportunities at an asset level and so we'll be aware and alert to those things. The nice thing is we're not in a position where we have to do anything. We strengthened ourselves significantly with a very good deal last year. We've got plenty of inventory to work on for many, many years to come. And anything we would do would have to, A, fit strategically into a strong portfolio, and B, it would have to compete for capital in a strong portfolio. And so we'll continue to hold the bar very high and only consider things that would really make a lot of sense. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng at Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : First, I just want to say thank you to Wayne over the last three years for all the help and insights and wish you the best in your next role. Two questions, Mike or Pierre. One, I want to go back into the federal leases exposure. Can you share with us, in the Permian, over the 2019 and 2020, what percent of your activity is actually in the federal leases? I understand that federal leases will be only about 10%, 15% of your overall Permian land position, but want to see that on a 360 lens of how that looked like? And also that how many permit that you already in hand in Permian and whether you have all the lipid permits for your program in the Gulf of Mexico this year? Also, that if you can just give the production number in the fourth quarter in Permian DJ and Duvernay? The second question is on ESG and the carbon new product or service. We understand you are not interested in going into the renewable power like solar and wind. But is there any other new product or service related to ESG and carbon, do you think you have the technology that you can build it into a new business and not just as a concept, but as a new business? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Hey Paul, its Pierre. I'll start with your first question. I think we'll take some of that offline with Wayne and the IR team in terms of production from the various basins. Our federal acreage, as you said, in the Permian is less than 10%, it went down a little bit due to Noble acquisition. We're not going to disclose the activity for the last year and how much was the mix, I think you can find, it's publicly available data and you can chase that down. In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well known that permits tend - you don't - you have a lower inventory at permit. So if we have a bigger inventory permits in the Permian Basin, we and other operators do, that's not the case in the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory. I will just point out that we have one floating rig on a long-term contract in the Gulf of Mexico that expires at the end of the year. So we'll again take your other detailed questions offline. And then Mike, do you want to answer the energy transition? Mike Wirth : Yes, I was thinking about the first questions and so energy transition as I caught it, Paul, what technologies are we interested in? I think we've indicated carbon capture and storage for sure, we recently made an investment in other carbon storage technology startup and you can expect to continue to hear more from us on that front. And then of course hydrogen should be in our wheelhouse. We manufacture hydrogen today, we've sold hydrogen before at retail and we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today, but not economically practical and look for ways to drive costs down and scale up hydrogen over time. And so I can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives today, but that's an area that few companies have the capability to do all the things required and we're one of the types of companies that should be able to work on that. So those would be two areas you can expect to see us active in. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Terreson at Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Mike, Chevron's equity has handily outperformed the S&P Energy since you became CEO a few years ago whether it's focus or decisiveness, I think as you'd like to call it, on higher returns on capital and lower debt and lower dividend breakevens have been a winning formula with energy investors. Simultaneously, the pace of change in the industry seems to be quickening not only as it relates to policy, which you talked about a minute ago and likely future energy mix, but also that which is expected from investments within the sector. So my question is a couple-fold. Number one, how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving environment, which is somewhat different? Two, more tactical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe more than in the past. And then finally what might be the implications for financial strategy in this new environment or is it too early to know? Mike Wirth : Yes, well, hey, Doug, first of all, I want to congratulate you, reason being throwing bouquets to Wayne. I know this is the last lap around the track for you this year as well. So, congratulations and best wishes in the future. Doug Terreson : Thanks. Mike Wirth : On your question, I think a lot of the fundamentals that we've been exhibiting in our strategy will continue to serve shareholders well as we go forward, the capital and cost discipline, it is the ability to meet the needs of today's markets while investing for tomorrow's markets and with the diversified portfolio we have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our portfolio. So, for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right, things are evolving now, but they've been evolving for quite some time and I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialog we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix change and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do. At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend, we're committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend and that can be a reinvestment across the entire spectrum of energy technologies, maintaining a strong balance sheet, we've seen this last year how important that is. And then we've got surplus cash after those first three needs to distribute that back to shareholders. That framework is intact and I don't see that changing. Doug Terreson : And also good luck to Wayne for me as well, he has done as done a great job in this role. Thanks a lot. Mike Wirth : Thanks Doug. Are there any other questions? Operator : We'll move next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Please go ahead. Biraj Borkhataria : I had a couple. So the first one is just around your comments around generating free cash flow, prevailing commodity prices. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the balance sheet and where you'd be comfortable in terms of gearing, as you move through 2021? Also, Pierre, maybe you can touch on the recent announcement from the S&P on potential changes in credit ratings in the sector and risk of the industry with the transition and how that is working into your thinking in managing the balance sheet? And then the second question on a different topic with Gorgon down in the quarter presuming that's obviously a decent hit to your LNG portfolio. Can you confirm if you were buying spot LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter, and then just if you can give a rough sense of the quantity or the earnings impact on that because I guess that's more transitory in nature given some of the issues there. Thank you. Pierre Breber : All right. Thanks, Biraj. It's Pierre. I'll start. Mike just went through our financial priorities and we're in a good place on a debt ratio. Our net debt ratio is under 23%, that includes the assumption of debt from the Noble acquisition which added about $9 billion of debt. So I've talked about, we don't have a target net debt ratio range but I've talked about a range between 20% and 25% is a good place to be over the cycle, we can be below that at times, we'd be heading up towards this range, if we're above it for some reason, I'd want to have confidence that we're heading down that range. So it's not a hard and fast target. But we're in a really good place with a leading balance sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we provided some guidance on here on the call. In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them, it was an industry-wide call. I think our track record speaks for itself in terms of being disciplined with capital, protecting the balance sheet and being very progressive about the future of energy and our approach of higher returns, lower carbon. So I think that lines up with the rating agencies. But that's not something we control, that will be up to them, we're managing the company for long-term value, and we think we're doing a good job. Mike Wirth : Biraj, on your question on Australian LNG, simple way to think about this is we've got 80% or so of our volume termed up and you can think about having a train down for a better part of this last quarter. So, four out of five trains running, so about 80% of our capacity. So we've been able to satisfy all of our term needs and we're in the market now with our commercial organization buying a cargo here and some of the cargo there, and then on the spot market, but we haven't been out of position and hurt because we had to buy high and sell low to any meaningful degree through this whole cycle. Operator : We'll move next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Wayne, I want to wish you good luck and hoping Roderick gets to the level you are thinking here. Congratulations. Guys. I wonder if I could just go back to the capital allocation question very quickly. Mike, you've now got Israel on a lot of growth opportunities that Noble had talked about longer term and it sounds like you're barging away a little bit from the need for growth in the Permian. I'm just wondering if under Biden administration, is that how we should think about capital allocation international versus domestic now you've got bigger opportunity set? Mike Wirth : We'll have to see how things play out in the U.S. I don't want to overreact to that at this point in time until we know more. But fundamentally, we intend to continue to be very disciplined in the allocation of capital. Noble's assets in Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them. Right now, there is capacity to grow production there with little or no incremental capital right now and the nice thing is we bring some capabilities to bear here that might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse. So there is ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it facilities that have all LNG today, they should go into our - Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept, there are ways to take it to power markets and in the power generation and then regional power distribution across borders and there are opportunities to look at things like hydrogen and new energy technologies as well. So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could have and some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets, that should be an advantage. And so will look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel. And then the broad allocation question U.S. versus other countries. We're always thinking about that and always looking at that and drawn by returns and risk and we'll continue to evaluate those things. Doug Leggate : My follow-up is maybe for Pierre, a follow-up to the S&P question earlier. Not clear or unsure whether you guys want to answer this, but it's really more about the external pressures that you're seeing whether it be from one of your large peers seeing an active shareholder, we're talking about big energy European investment community and obviously your European peers moving in that direction and now you've got the credit agencies and it seems to me at least that the U.S. side of the pond, you're still very much in the big oil category in terms of how you see your opportunity set going forward. I'm just curious, Mike or Pierre, how do you see these external pressures influencing discussions with the Board, discussions with investors and ultimately the longer term energy mix, when we see Chevron move towards up big energy story over time? Mike Wirth : Well, I'm going to come back, I think Pierre mentioned earlier that we describe our strategy with four simple words, it's higher returns and lower carbon and both of those things matter to the investors that we speak to. and we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and demonstrate that we're going to do that and at the same time. We also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future and we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that and we'll continue to set new targets in that area because the world stepping on the hose of supply through one way or another doesn't really change demand. And so, somehow demand will need to be met and we think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity and then likewise, looking at these breakthrough technologies and I mentioned a couple of them earlier. So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There is not an empirically observable a correct answer to this and I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right, our boards, our employees, our customers of the countries where we operate, and that's a policy that we operate under to manage both of these things and look energy is the lifeblood of the global economy and reliable affordable energy will be fundamental to the recovery from the pandemic, in the short term and in the longer term, it will be fundamental to lifting people out of poverty around the world and we have to remember that. And today's energy system is not the enemy. Lower emissions are what we should be focused on and that's what we as a company are focused on and that's what we talk to our stakeholders about and that's what we're committed to doing. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Sankey at Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hello Mike, a strategy question. You've obviously addressed your strategy on the call, but I just wondered in the light of activism that we're seeing, what - are there any specific requests if you like, or strategy pushes that you're getting from shareholders? I wondered if you could just update us on what you've been hearing and perhaps whether you're sympathetic to the ideas that are being pushed towards you, and maybe whether you're pushing back? And then I had a follow-up just on the decline rates. You said that you got higher decline rates on lower spending in '21. Having said that, the number is only 70,000 barrels a day or about a 2% decline. Can you just help me understand why that number is so low? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yes, Paul. So on strategy push from shareholders, it's not a lot that's being said and shareholder discussions, they haven't discussed here. It's - what is your strategy for a lower carbon world and yourself having unique strengths and if there's one thing I do hear back from people, it is support for not going into things where we wouldn't have competitive differentiation and we may pursue lower return investments just for the sake of saying, we're doing it when there's others out there that can do it just as well. So beyond that, I'm not hearing a lot of strategy push from shareholders. I'll let Pierre take the question on declines. Pierre Breber : Yes. And just add to Mike's comments, I mean this is a sector that is trying to regain favor with investors and it hasn't earned its cost of capital and the way out of that isn't by investing more capital. So being disciplined in our conventional business with capital being disciplined in M&A and being disciplined with the energy transition as Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that have cycles up and down just like conventional products do. In terms of our decline, yeah, Paul, I'm not sure what I meant to say is that you will see declines this year resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down, but as you rightly point out the decline and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis. So again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline. It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian growing, that's how that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to invest $40 billion over the last year and this year. But $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out. But as you point out, it's a modest decline, it's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore, and even the declines in what's considered high decline areas like the Permian, we're able to mitigate. Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our guidance range and will actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and if you adjust for curtailments. So it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines and I'm happy picked up on that number. Operator : And we will move next to Dan Boyd of Mizuho Securities. Dan Boyd : Hi, thanks for squeezing me on what I would just say thanks for sticking to your guns and only doing things where you have a competitive advantage. Clear business sense. I - most things have been asked, so I just have one for, Pierre, just on the FX, which has been a headwind to earnings this year. Can you talk about the cash impact that that has if any and how you see that potentially playing out in 2021? Pierre Breber : Yes, the vast majority of it is non-cash, I mean it's balance sheet translation. So it's taking your monetary accounts, asset accounts and liability accounts and revaluing it. What we've seen is during the course of the year the dollar strengthened initially and then we saw it weakening relative to other currencies in particularly like in Australia, Canada, some of the others where we'll have like a deferred tax liability that gets revalued. So it turns into cash over time, but it depends on what the exchange rate is at that time in the future. So you have modest amounts that happened in the quarter, but the vast majority is reflecting a full revaluation of that liability - monetary liability or monetary asset account and what - how it ultimately settles will decide if those gains or losses are realized or not in cash flow. Operator : We'll go next to Manav Gupta at Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : I just wanted to ask one question, you are absolutely leading the charge on RNG and some of the projects that you are actually developing even RNG have a CI of like minus 150 to minus 200, that's significantly lower than any EV can actually produce at this point of time. Yet, all we see out there is the demand for EVs and states saying they only want to run on EVs and car manufacturers saying they only want to make EVs. So is there something that Chevron and the industry groups can do to educate the governments or the markets that there are other forms of lower carbon like RNG which actually have a much significantly lower carbon intensity than an actual EV? Mike Wirth : Manav, I'm impressed, you've done your homework on carbon intensity and not many have to your-- the foundation of your question. Look, RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because if you mitigate otherwise unmitigated methane emissions and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor. CI factor has to be worth something and maybe because RNG from a first-cost basis is more expensive than fossil natural gas. And so in markets where there is a policy framework that creates that financial connection to the low CI, it's attractive and economic and that's where we're playing today, I would expect over time that those policy frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlying your question. And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. We've got an initiative in California where we will subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement and then we're working with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen. So we think that's a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the mix that we think deserves to grow and that's why we've been investing into it and it ties to the earlier comments about doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages. Operator : We'll move next to Jon Rigby at UBS. Jon Rigby : Thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually. One is on, when you think about the portfolio and also what you've seen in the market through the sort of '15 - '14, '15 volatility, the volatility you see now. Are you starting to change the way you look at the investments that you're making going forward, so you are looking at hurdle rates, payback periods et cetera and changing them to sort of tailor a different environment going forward? And also I mean if you are, are you able to do that through the portfolio? Can you also do that through the way you approach the development of an asset, so you build it with the expectation of adding satellites longer term or you build the bigger host et cetera? First question. The second which is slightly tied to that and it seems to me also you demonstrated that low gearing, a low level of debt indebtedness has served you very well through those two cycles. So when you think about the sort of three shock absorbers that you have, so short cycle investments, balance sheet and buybacks, is in the near term the priority getting debt down? Thanks. Pierre Breber : All right. Thanks, Jon. Look, I'll get started. I think the answer to your first question is yes and no. No, we're not changing how we look at investments, we don't want to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our business is volatile. We've had - not just '14, '15, you go '08-'09, you go late '90s and so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with some frequency is capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense, it transfers too much risk to equity holders and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think a bit differently, but to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been, I mean it's our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar of capital invested. We've talked about being very disciplined with our capital which reinforces it, but the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the last several years, that's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company. And as you said, I think to your second part of the question, how we operate with our four financial priorities is it reflects that reality and so we understand what business we're in. And then how - what kind of capital structure we should have that's in the interest of our shareholders. Jon Rigby : Right. So - but to that point is even with an advantage balance sheet that you have against your peers, I think that's what they acknowledge, would it be fair to say that the first priority those of the three variable things excepting the dividend is a structural thing is probably balance sheet? Pierre Breber : Well, again, our four priorities, Mike went through and it's dividend, reinvestment because we got to generate cash for the dividend, maintaining a strong balance sheet and buybacks is fourth and so we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet, I gave a kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over the cycle, and again we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. So the balance sheet is, well. It's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there is no primary need on balance sheet. I mean what's more, the bigger driver is, we're not at a full economic recovery here and so getting control the pandemic, getting the world economies growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business. Our breakeven is under $50, you can do the math, if oil prices are above $50 and if downstream margins improve because that's a breakeven under $50 including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have excess cash and we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past. Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of cash to shareholders in the form of sustained and growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess cash. Operator : We'll take our final question from Ryan Todd at Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : I'll just - maybe a couple of quick ones at the end. On disposals moving forward and with the downsized capital program, should we expect a relatively downsized disposal program on a run rate basis? And if so, is there a range in terms of what we should think of in terms of annual disposals? And then maybe as a follow-up question. As we think about your 2021 production guidance, the contract expirations in Indonesia and Thailand, can you confirm what the volume impact is there and any willingness to share what the potential cash flow impact of those volumes would be at $50 oil? Mike Wirth : Okay, I'll take the asset sale question and let Pierre handle contracts. Ryan, first thing is, we don't need to conduct asset sales to generate cash, other companies might be in a different position. But, look, we've closed out the program we announced previously, we're not announcing a new program. Pierre guided to $2 billion to $3 billion for '21 and if you look back over the last two decades, we've been kind of plus or minus a couple of billion dollars a year in normal portfolio maintenance and kind of rotation. And so I think that's the kind of a number you want to think about for your model. And like I said this coming year we might be a little bit to the upside of that, there'll be some years we'd be below that. But we're doing this to high grade and strengthen our portfolio. Not to generate cash. Pierre, I'll let you take the contracts question. Pierre Breber : Yes, Ryan, I mean we disclosed in our supplement tables that we provide each quarter production by country. You see it in our 10-K. So I think it's pretty transparent what production in Indonesia and Thailand is. Not all of Thailand is part of the concessions that are expiring here early next year. We don't disclose cash flow by country. I mean, there's a fair amount of disclosure in our oil and gas tables that you can look back for there. So we'll continue to provide what we think is meaningful guidance each quarter as we go forward. We showed the variance that was tied to contract expirations. So I think all the pieces of the puzzle are there for you. And of course, if you have follow-up questions, please reach out to Wayne and Roderick. Wayne Borduin : Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Audra, back to you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. I am Roderick Green, General Manager of Investor Relations and on the call with me today is Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks Roderick. This quarter, we had our best financial performance of the last year as the global economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.90 per share. Included in the quarter were pension settlement costs and legal reserves totalling $351 million. Pension settlement and curtailment costs will be a special item going forward. For comparability purposes, 2020 adjusted earnings were recast to exclude these costs. Also found in the appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. CapEx was down over 40% from a year ago and we ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 22.5%. For the first time since the pandemic, cash flow from operations excluding working capital exceeded our cash CapEx and dividend spending. Cash balances ended the quarter slightly higher due to timing considerations. We expect cash balances to come back down later in the year. Free cash flow excluding working capital was $3.4 billion, up significantly from last year and higher than the 2019 quarterly average. With oil prices back up to around 2019 levels and downstream earnings still recovering, higher free cash flow this quarter is driven by the change in cash CapEx -- less than half of the 2019 quarterly average. Maintaining and growing our dividend remains our top financial priority. Earlier this week, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend increase, about 4%, that positions Chevron to extend our streak to 34 consecutive years of higher annual dividend per share payouts. Since 2005, Chevron's dividend per share has grown over 7% per year beating the S&P 500 and more than 4x our peer average. When our first three financial priorities have been met, we also have a track record of repurchasing shares, 13 out of the past 17 years. As we look forward, we expect to begin the repurchase of shares when we're confident that we can sustain a buyback program for multiple years through the oil price cycle. When making this decision, we'll consider the likelihood of future sustained excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet. Adjusted first quarter earnings decreased about $700 million versus the same quarter last year. Upstream earnings increased on higher prices and downstream earnings declined on a swing in timing effects and lower margins and volumes resulting from the pandemic. Both segments had negative impacts from Winter Storm Uri. Other was down primarily due to employee benefit costs. Compared with last quarter, adjusted Upstream earnings were up more than $1.4 billion due to higher prices. Downstream earnings increased primarily due to margins and timing effects, including the absence of last quarter's year-end inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million. Other was down in part due to employee benefit costs. Upstream production was down 3.5% from a year ago. The increase in production due to the Noble acquisition was more than offset by a number of factors including declines, asset sales, Winter Storm Uri, and OPEC+ curtailments. Winter Storm Uri impacted both our upstream and downstream businesses with earnings impact of about $300 million after tax in the quarter. All upstream production has been restored, and major downstream and chemical units have restarted. We also achieved first gas flow from the successful execution of the Alen Gas Monetization Project in Equatorial Guinea. This project allows gas from the Alen field to be processed through existing onshore facilities. Finally, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units in NBLX. This stock transaction is expected to close in mid-May. We continued to take action to advance a lower carbon future. Last week, we announced an MOU with Toyota to work together to develop commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. Also, we\u2019ve continued to invest in emerging low-carbon technologies, including announcing five venture investments this year in geothermal power, offshore wind and green ammonia. In addition, we're in the early stages of developing a bioenergy project with carbon capture and sequestration in Mendota, California. This plant is expected to convert agricultural waste biomass, such as almond trees, into a gas to generate electricity and sequester emissions of 300,000 tons of CO2 annually. Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia at Gorgon Train 3 where the planned turnaround and repairs of propane vessels are underway. The impact from OPEC curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, the FGP project recently placed the final module on its foundation. Remobilization of the construction workforce achieved about 95% of the end of first quarter objective. Further workforce additions are expected this quarter. In summary, it was a good quarter with our strongest financial performance in a year, continued progress towards advancing a lower carbon future and a dividend increase while maintaining an industry leading balance sheet. During last month's Investor Day, we shared our goal of higher returns, lower carbon. This quarter was another step in that direction. As we look forward to the next few quarters and the world gets better control of this virus, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver stronger financial performance and help advance a lower carbon future. With that, I will turn it over to Roderick. Roderick Green : Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will do our best to get all your questions. Katie, please open up the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question here, maybe just a housekeeping item on the numbers. Can you provide a little more color on the moving pieces for cash flow this quarter? It came in a little below street's expectations. And I guess if we're doing it right, we apply your cash flow sensitivity per dollar change and brand. And we're still coming up with a higher cash flow number than reported despite winter storm Uri. So we're just wondering if we're missing any other one offs other than the pension settlement since I know there was a lot going on this quarter. Pierre Breber : Yes, thanks. Our dividend break even in the past couple of quarters with weak downstream margins has been around $50. It was a little higher this quarter. There was nothing operational except winter storm Uri, it's really primarily due to some non-operational items like accruals for legal reserves and taxes. Those are non-cash in the quarter. But when we look at cash flow excluding working capital, of course, we're taking out that working capital effect. So those kinds of accruals which are charges result in a lower cash flow ex working capital. Point out though that our free cash flow in the first quarter 2021 was higher than free cash flow in 2019, even though 2019 had much stronger downstream margins and similar oil prices, and that's primarily because of the cash CapEx. So I think you're doing the calculation, right. The tricky thing about these cash flow breakeven is you don't hold everything else constant, all the other margins and indicators, and then some of these timing effects on accruals. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe my second question on the buyback and free cash flow. So on our projections, we see pretty strong near term free cash flow, and the trajectory, it really meaningfully steps up in 2024, 2025, with Tengiz and some of your long cycle [GoM] [ph] projects starting up in the Permian. So I think to us this suggests that for the buyback, it makes a lot of sense to leg into a program, kind of similar to what you did in '18 and '19, versus a consistent amount per year, which I think was the last commentary before the pandemic, which I know changed a ton of things. So can you provide any thoughts on how you envision the buyback getting reinstated? Pierre Breber : We have a track record of buying back shares pretty consistently, 13 of last 17 years, over $50 billion of buyback since that time, at an average price in the mid 80s, less than $1 higher than the ratable price that would have been in for every single day during that whole time period. As I said on the prepared remarks, when we start a program, if and when we start a program, we'll want to sustain it for multiple years, because we want to get it through the commodity price cycle. Shareholders feel differently about buybacks, there's a concern that we only buy back when our share price is high. That's a perception. That's not the reality, because I just shared with you the actual numbers. But that's the perception that we have to deal with. So the common ground we find is, when we start a program, have confidence that we can sustain it for multiple years. And we're going to look to those two factors, the likelihood of future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather a down cycle and oil prices that we know is going to happen. So we're not yet on a sustained global economic recovery feel very good about where we are here in the United States and several other countries, but there are a number of countries where they're still working to get control of the virus. And so we think it's appropriate so we increase the dividend, which is consistent with our financial priorities. We don't need -- we're not going to increase the capital this year and we have tight guidance out five years we have the balance sheet in a very good place. So yes, in the short-term, any excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. But over time, excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends like you saw us announced a couple days ago and in the form of buybacks over time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Good morning, Pierre, Roderick and congratulations on your first earnings call. I wonder Pierre, if I could just hit what might be the 800 pound gorilla in the room, which is the acquisition of Noble. The production seems to have kind of disappeared in the mix. And it's raising some questions, at least from people we speak to about whether Chevron is under investing to sustain long-term production capacity, what would your response be to that? Pierre Breber : We're not under investing. We showed during our Investor Day that we're very capital efficient and at our $14 billion to $16 billion. We in fact, we're going to go production around 3%, [or not] [ph]. That's the thought and ambition of us to have production growth as an outcome of what's a very capital efficient program. Jeanine mentioned, we're investing to increase production at Tengiz. We don't have that production. Now, that's $2.5 billion in the budget at Tengiz. So we have our eye on long-term value through this whole crisis. If you really step back to when this started about a year ago, we did hit short-term capital pretty hard. We kept our eye on long-term value. We didn't see the virtue and investing capital to add short-term production in a world that was going to be oversupply for some time period. And arguably still is with OPEC+ barrels constrained. And again, we're not back to a full sustained economic recovery. But we preserve the options on long-term value. I'm very cognizant that we have a dividend obligation, we're one of the few companies that didn't cut the dividend, we're the only company that's increased the dividend, and really a dividend increase that averages 6% per year during a very difficult time. And we show during our Investor Day, that we have the capability to grow free cash flow 10% per year over five years. And that's coming from Tengiz, which we'll see in a couple of years and growth in the Permian when the world needs the barrel. So we're not going to chase short-term production, we don't see value in that. Our production guidance for this year is unchanged 0% to 3%. You saw our reserve replacement numbers, the Noble acquisition, undoubtedly, has helped. Remember, we showed and Mike showed at the last quarter call that we've invested actually the same amount that we expected post-COVID as pre-COVID, pre-COVID, we would have said $20 billion a year for last year and this year, about 40 billion. Organically, we're only going to do about 13 or 14 each year, that when you add in the 12 or 13 from Noble or is it exactly where we were pre-COVID. So we are not under investing. We have to sustain and grow the enterprise. But we're doing it in a very capital efficient way. Doug Leggate : Appreciate the answer. Pierre, my follow up is actually related to CapEx. So I guess a quick one, but you are obviously running well below your run rate for the year, is that the timing issue. How would you expect the cadence to look over the balance of the year? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Yes, thanks. It is really timing. I mean, first quarter is normally a little light, winter storm Uri obviously you're not drilling wells when you're shutting in production and dealing with the challenges of that extraordinary winter event. And then, there is just timing of some major capital projects that are more back end loaded. So no change to our guidance of a $14 billion organic program, we saw a small inorganic acquisition in the first quarter numbers. So that can be different going forward. But from an organic perspective, we're going to stick with the budget. We are running a little low, as you say, we think we'll end up pretty close to the budget by year end. Operator : We will take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, Pierre. My first question here is actually a bit of a follow up in the cash flow in the quarter. There was a $500 million headwind from affiliate cash flows in the quarter and the cash flow statement. And in the last quarter call, you had given a guidance for the full year of 0 to 500 million headwind. There was not an update given in the slides this time. So I was wondering if it was just front loaded, or if there's any change to that. And I recognize the affiliates also can tie into the Tengiz co-lend. So has that guidance changed, either? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Yes, thanks. So we didn't change our guidance, because it's just early. I think you're right. I think you're inferring that the guidance, in particular for Tengiz will get better. We gave a co-lending guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion. Right now, we'd be at the low-end of the range. And frankly, we could be at zero depending on if prices stay where there are right now. So you should expect us to update that guidance at mid year when we see a little more time with commodity prices, but clearly Tengiz when we have prices over $60, that reduces the need for co-lending and might not require any. And again, you could see a dividend out of Tengiz that's a decision for the TCO shareholders to make but we have not had a dividend now for I think, two or three years and so that would also be positive. In terms of affiliates, I mean, that cash flow line again, the difference between earnings from affiliates and the dividends, the dividends were about flat between fourth quarter and this quarter. So that's not a variance on the cash flow. But you're right that that there's some timing in that some of the Winter Storm Uri effects kind of factor into CPChem. Again, we'll update that guidance when we get to mid-year. Phil Gresh : Okay. And then, the second question is on Tengiz, you're obviously continuing to ramp the headcount. I think at this point, most investors are assuming some kind of delay in the startup timing as well as impacts to costs from that potential delay. Kind of hard to overcome maybe a timing delay. But is it possible that you can still, in your mind, be able to do this within budget, even with the timing delays? I recognize you haven't given an official update here. But I just want to get your latest thinking. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Yes, thanks. So let me just take us back or start with the Investor Day. We were at 22,000. We remobilized to 25,000, just short of our 26,000 first quarter objective. Then, you saw where we plan to go in the second quarter. And we're excited also, big milestone was getting the last of 86 modules on two foundations. So we're still making very good progress. We are managing through a pandemic, we have all the safeguards in place. They're working. We have a very low rate of positive cases right now. We've also started a vaccination program at Tengiz. It includes both the project and the producing operation staff. So it's not just for the project also for the base operations. We've been allocated about 10,000 doses administered already 7000. Future vaccinations, though, will depend on more allocations from the Republic of Kazakhstan. This is not a company program we're doing it with the government and are allocated by the government in Kazakhstan. So to answer your question, and at this time, there's more pressure on schedule than costs. We have a backlog of work because of the demobilization last year and having to isolate work teams at times when we do have a positive case. It's possible but hard to fully make up the schedule. We also have incurred higher costs as a result of COVID. We've had some cost efficiencies and some foreign exchange benefits that may be able to offset the higher costs. So as we've said in the past, we need to demonstrate that we can remobilize, fully remobilize stay at full numbers, meet productivity targets and achieve our milestones while managing through a pandemic. And the spring and summer work campaigns are very important to give us the data that will help us get a reliable update on cost and schedule. Operator : We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : My first one is a follow up on some of the production questions from earlier and it relates more specifically to the Permian. And I think one of the things that stood out in your recent Investor Day was the fact that even at a much lower capital spending level, you were still able to achieve a similar level of growth in the Permian, over the next few years differed slightly versus pre-COVID plans but still attractive growth there. As you think about the resumption of activity to facilitate that growth here over the next few years. Can you talk a little bit about the cadence and timing or from a market standpoint, what signals in terms of oil prices or otherwise that you need to see, to begin increasing activity there to resume that planned production ramp? Pierre Breber : Yes. We've been focused on three metrics, three conditions. So again, oil prices are going to move up and down. We're focused on the fundamentals, we look into three indicators. The first is, is the global economy on a sustained path to recovery not quite there yet clearly optimistic here in the United States with high vaccination rates on the stimulus package, a few other countries, but again, a number of countries don't have control of virus. So we need to get on a sustained path of economic recovery. The second is, we need to see OPEC+ barrels. Get back into the market. We're starting to see that we need to have clarity on what actions are going to take, but there's still a lot of production that is being curtailed. And then, the third and I think the third condition has been largely met, it's inventory -- are back to near normal. And so the inventory surplus for the most part has been worked off. So I'd say one of the three conditions now, that's for us to increase CapEx, not this year, our budget is fixed this year, $14 billion, but within the $14 billion to $16 billion 5 year guidance that we talked about. So we're still talking about a modest, a modest increase. In terms of the Permian, everything is going very well there. The first quarter production was clearly impacted by Winter Storm Uri, that's about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, for the quarter. But if you take that out production, I think, looks good. Our declines we shared last second quarter, Jay shared that production could decline 6% to 7%, if we stayed at low activity levels, it's probably a little bit better than that it might be closer to 5%. But undoubtedly, we're at the low investment levels that we're doing right now. We'll see some declines. That is okay. That is the correct response to an oversupplied market, particularly again, when we're keeping our eye on long-term value. So what you could see later this year is we could bring right now operated we have five rigs to completion crews, our net non-op is a similar rig count. Certainly, we could bring back a completion crew later this year. And that would help us produce some of our drilled and uncompleted wells. But in terms of getting on the trajectory that we showed at our Investor Day, there's still time I mean that outlook kind of factored in, that we would still be in this kind of not full recovery at this point in time. And then, it ramps up, over the next year and the year after that. So can we do it faster? We absolutely can. Can we hold it where we're at here longer if necessary? We can it's very flexible. It's the appropriate response, but the long-term value and the point I think of your question, is there, right, the million barrels a day that we showed in 2025. But more importantly, highly accretive to returns, strong free cash flow, right, free cash flow positive last year, growing free cash flow. So it's a fantastic position we have. We were advantaged because of the royalty. We intend to invest in there but we're going to do it at the right time. Devin McDermott : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And as we think about decarbonization energy transition and returns, I think you've had a very thoughtful approach on that and focusing on returns, enhancing investments, decarbonizing your existing portfolio, integrating renewables in the portfolio has been one of the pillars there. You've had some progress here over the past few months in both venture activities, you highlighted in the slide, the hydrogen MOU. And my question is, you've seen some of your peers in the industry form new business ventures focus specifically on commercializing technology and scaling up new business opportunities to hopefully become growth engines, over time returns enhancing growth engines. Can you talk a little bit more about Chevron strategy for transitioning some of the investments and opportunities available to capture so far into new growth ventures over time, including in a monetization strategy or scaling strategy for some of the venture investments that you've talked about here, in your prepared remarks. Pierre Breber : Yes. Well, you summarized our strategy pretty well, I'll hit it really quickly. The first is to make the oil and gas that we produce as low carbon as we can. We put out 2028 targets that have a 35% reduction. We think we're top quartile. We will stay top quartile. And we showed a slide that say we go beyond that and get the carbon intensity down into the mid teens in terms of kilograms per barrels of oil equivalent. So that's the first. That's really done in the segments. That's really where the work gets done. The second is to increase renewable energy alongside our conventional products. So renewable natural gas sold along with conventional natural gas, renewable diesel sold alongside our conventional diesel you seen, we're going to co-process at our LA refinery later this year biofeed along with conventional feed and make renewable products, have renewable diesel biodiesel and more than half of our service stations in the United States. So good progress there. And then, the third is to grow low carbon businesses. And that's exactly that's hydrogen carbon capture, the venture investments are important. And they are really making sure we're staying connected to all the latest technology. But we intend to do exactly what you say is grow these businesses. So let me talk about project Mendota in California. We're in partnership with Schlumberger and Microsoft. It is going to capture the emissions from agricultural waste, so they burn almond trees after a certain number of productive seasons. Normally, those emissions just go to the atmosphere, this project would capture those emissions, converted into a synthetic gas that can then generate power and use that power to compress the CO2 and inject it in the ground and then sell excess power into the grid. And that's a project that's now front-end engineering and design. We're looking at another Carbon Capture Pilot with Savante in Bakersfield. So the venture investments is an enabler to growing hydrogen and carbon capture business. That's exactly what we intend to do over time. These are nascent businesses require lots of partnerships but we're going to be a player in it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : So, the first one is just on Gorgan. Pierre can just talk about the state of play there, it sounds like Train 3 is going down and in the back half year, you're going to be running closer to nameplate capacity. But just to talk about maintenance there and where we stand with the project. Pierre Breber : Yes, Neil, it's pretty straightforward. We're doing our the scheduled Train 3 turnaround, separately, or it turns out and at the same time we're able to do the repairs. We expect that to be completed by the end of this quarter. And then, you're right, we'd be operating all three trains in the second half of the year. There was a short -- there was a time period in the first quarter where we saw all three trains operating between the train one turnaround and the start of the train three work. So we know what those units can do and we're excited to get back to it here in the third quarter. Wheatstone will have a planned turnaround late third quarter, early fourth quarter, but again, we expect Gorgon to be running full during the second half of this year. Neil Mehta : Pierre you guys have been really good at M&A. Being opportunistic, willing to step away when the bid went away from you and taking in assets like Noble towards the bottom of the cycle. It's a core competency for Chevron. As you look at the landscape, how do you think about M&A and whether there are opportunities out there and how are you evaluating that? Pierre Breber : Neil, we're really happy with the Noble acquisition. Again, if we step back and think of July, it was still an uncertain time and announcing -- being the first to announce that major transaction closing first in and October, having now two quarters where we've been integrated, seeing everything we said the free cash flow accretion, the returns accretion, earnings accretion. The synergies doubled from 300 million to 600 million, achieved 80% of them, we'll get the rest before the year end. Very happy with the talent from the Noble employees that have come across DJ basin and the Eastern Med. So again, what was a very good deal looks even better now. Now, look, it's a challenge to obviously replicate that, we will always be looking, we have a very high bar, Noble, got over the bar with the quality assets and the value that we saw. We don't need to do an acquisition to Doug's earlier question. We are sustaining and growing this enterprise. I'm very cognizant of that. And again, we need to do that to sustain and grow the dividend. At the same time, there's times inorganic, can enhance the company. And so, if we see something that will make that Investor Day story, we told even better, then we'll pursue it. I do think industry consolidation will continue. Undoubtedly, valuations have moved from back where we were in July. We know it's a long game, we're very patient. And again, we don't need to do a transaction. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Pierre, two questions, first, among your peers that I think you have probably the happier concentration in California. And with the governor latest proposal, how that may impact your overall operation or how you may restructure yet or if you do need to restructure yet. So I want to see that, how you guys thinking about the policy impacting on your business in California, both in the downstream and upstream? The second question that if we look at some of the smaller [indiscernible], in the last [indiscernible], in the last 12 months, I think one of the movement is into the variable dividend, which is never attained for the major oil companies such as you guys. You guys always use the share buyback. So just curious that internally that have the board and management even consider the variable dividend versus buyback to see which is a better way to return cash to their shareholders. Pierre Breber : I'll answer your second question, first. Of course, we pay close attention to what everybody does. We have not been convinced that there's a better cash return story than what we do, which is a steadily growing dividend, again, with a 4% increase announced 34th consecutive year of growing dividends, 7% compounded rate for the last 15 years. And a ratable buyback program 13 out of 17 years very close to the actual ratable price during that whole time. So we talked to our shareholders all the time. I think our shareholders support our framework. But of course, we'll keep an open mind, but we don't see the value in it. Look, I think those approaches are gaining favor, in part because dividends have been cut by other companies and other actions that have not been as consistent as predictable and as reliable as what we've done over that track record of 34 years on the dividend and 17 years on the buyback. If we go to California policy, there's -- I'm not sure exactly which one you're referring to there's an internal combustion. I don't know if it's a ban or a rulemaking proposal to reduce that. But I think 2035 there's also a governor requested the rule makers to look at rules on hydraulic fracturing. What I can say is that, certainly on hydraulic fracturing has been done safely in California under comprehensive regulations for a long time. It's been done safely elsewhere in the United States and safely all around the world. And I think when policies restrict supply, it just moves energy production to jurisdictions that likely have less regulation. And it also moves the jobs and the government revenues and increases the trade deficit. And I'll say the jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs you can raise a family on. So in terms of our operations, if some sort of hydraulic fracturing ban was implemented through the rulemaking process, it would not be material to Chevron's upstream operations in California. It impacts future drilling at a field that represents less than 10% of our production. Of course, we'll work with Governor Newsome though to make those rules, as you know, advanced the environmental objectives while continuing to support the jobs and the economic benefits of our industry. In terms of any kind of internal combustion engine ban, what I'd say is, we support the Paris Agreement, we support a price on carbon. Light passenger vehicles represent less than 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. So let's make sure we also focus on the other 90%. But if you want to look at to EVs and transportation put a price on carbon and let the technologies compete in the marketplace. Thanks, Paul. We'll go to the next question. Operator : We'll go to Ryan Todd with Simmon Energy. Pierre Breber : Hey, Ryan, are you there? Katie? Roderick Green : Could we go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Couple of things, I'd like to follow up on more look back and look forward. Gorgon in the first quarter, we had some fairly significant gas prices, you're typically more contracted than spot market. I was just wondering how that performed at a time where you were -- probably weren't able to participate much in the spot market. It was just curious how you covered the contracted side and how you think about that a little bit going forward. And then the other question I had hasn't gotten much play recently, but as part of the curtailments within OPEC+ how the neutral zone restart is going with the impacts are there for you. Pierre Breber : Sure. So on Australia, we've said that with one train down at Gorgon, which has been largely the case since mid-year last year. If you think of our Australia system is having five trains and so four out of five trains have been operating that lines up pretty closely with our contracts. So it's not an exact match, because some of the Wheatstone contracts and Gorgon contracts are a little bit different. But fundamentally, we're balanced. So yes, we the real opportunity costs from the Gorgon downtime was not participating in the spot market. So we didn't get the benefit of a relatively balanced, there were some trading puts and takes I would say in the LNG spot market, but nothing worth pointing out. In terms of PV that ramp up continues very well. It's at 60,000 barrels a day. Our share pre the shut in was about 80,000. So we expect to get there here during the course of the year. And then, of course, any OPEC+ curtailment at this point in time -- it's not being curtailed, but that's really subject to the local governments. Operator : We will go next to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : Hey, guys. I just quickly want to focus on two questions on the California project. The first one is because you are sequestering and storing in California. Does that mean that on top of IRS 45 Q credits, you also get the LCFS credits, because if you're not storing in California, as I understand, then LCFS is not available. And the quick follow up there is, why almond tree, is it only because the carbon intensity is minus 80? Or is it also because it's just you and one more guy chasing that feedstock? So what we're seeing in the soybean oil market that doesn't replicate. So if you could tell us why almond tree as a feedstock? Pierre Breber : Yes. Well, let me just step back for a moment. Just remember, we're just talking about transportation. That's the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally, right. The first is manufacturing, second, power generation, third is agriculture and land use and then fourth is transportation. So agriculture and land use is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions, you've seen our work in renewable natural gas, which again captures the methane from dairy cows and so that's a worthwhile area for us to look into. So the agricultural waste is just -- that's what happens is, it gets burned and those emissions go to the atmosphere. And so partnering with Schlumberger and Microsoft, that's a worthwhile project to capture and emission that otherwise we've ended the atmosphere -- emitted to the atmosphere and converting it and sequestering, essentially and generating some excess power. So it's early days. You're right. It's all policy enabled, including federal policy and California state policy. We're doing the front engineering a lot of work to do. But I think you're getting the -- the right idea is that we're looking for projects that are higher return lower carbon. And so this is a project I mean, generated return with the policy support, and reduces carbon. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Sorry about that. My phone, the call dropped right as you were asking me a question. Maybe if I could follow up on one of the earlier questions in terms of the research into the buyback, I think you walk through two of the things that you needed to see which is sustainable excess cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet, you mentioned, the near term cash goes onto the balance sheet is that because it's just the place to hold the cash while the sustainability gets to a level of confidence that you're okay with or is that because you actually feel like the balance sheet needs to be strengthened a little bit more before you restart the buy back. Pierre Breber : It's a bit of both. I mean, it's just how the math works, right? If you have excess cash, and you don't change your capital program, the dividend will just increase, so that's not going to change. So just by definition, it goes to the balance sheet. But it also, I think you can infer in my comments, that, again, we're looking to future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather, the commodity price cycle. So I'm not going to give you a hard target, we're going to use judgment, because there's judgment on future excess cash generation, this is our first quarter actually, with current excess cash generation. We expect the next couple quarters to be potentially even better, because you've got oil prices above 60, refining and chemicals margins much stronger. So it could be even better. At the same time, we don't have a sustained global economic recovery. So it's reasonable for us to be cautious, we want to be confident that when we start the program, we're going to continue it for multiple years. And we can sustain it through an oil price cycle. So I know that folks want a formula or a trigger, I know some of our competitors have those numbers, we're going to use judgment. And we're going to consider what we see in front of us in terms of the likelihood of future excess cash generation, we're going to want the balance sheet in a strong enough position that if oil prices cycle down, we can continue the buyback program relying on the balance sheet. our balance sheet is very strong right now. But yes, in the short-term, excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. That's kind of by definition, but it also serves a dual purpose of lowering our net debt ratio and putting us in a better position for when we start if and when we start a buyback program. Ryan Todd : Thanks. And then, maybe on a separate topic, if we talk a little bit about refining. I know you don't comment on news headlines. You mentioned recently in a news article connecting to a potential refinery acquisition in the U.S. north northwest, you did acquire a refinery in recent years. Can you talk about how you think about your portfolio exposure on the downstream side in general, appetite for increasing or reducing that exposure in any way and how your general view of the refining outlook over the medium term may play into, how you look at managing your portfolio? Pierre Breber : Yes, so again, I won't comment specifically on that report. The refinery in the Gulf Coast is very small acquisition that we made was something that I had foreshadowed, I was leading the business at that point in time, because we'd only had one refinery in the Gulf Coast region, we were, I think only company really major company with that setup, we did not -- we were on the eastern side of the Gulf Coast in Mississippi. And so our retail in Texas was supplied by third-party barrel. So we had talked about that, we didn't have to do that. But when the opportunity came and that transaction is kind of working, as we envision. So on the West Coast, we're a much different place. We have a two refinery system, we have a leading brand, really strong infrastructure. We're growing a little bit in Mexico, some of our retail volumes there. So I just say we're in a strong position on the West Coast. And in the Gulf Coast, we were also strong, but we felt we could make us even better by getting something on the eastern side and the Texas side. And we did that so I wouldn't read too much into it. We did in a small Australia retail fuels, which again was enabled our value chain out of Asia. So there's been some very targeted modest acquisitions in the refining business and retail business. But for the most part, that we have a focus, geographic footprint, very competitive business. As we look forward look, it's going to get better Winter Storm Uri is difficult as that event was for everybody in the region. One of the outcomes was it tightened inventories for fuels and especially for chemical. So those margins have recovered a little more quickly than they otherwise would have. And we think the next couple quarters are going to be good. And we're well positioned in our downstream and chemicals business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I guess following up on the downstream, since that's being discussed. Can you just comment on specifically your markets, you're focused on California and kind of the Asia Pacific region? And it seems like vaccine deployment and return to normalcy is kind of lagging there. So when you look across your portfolio, do you see kind of different pace of margin improvement and returned to normal and do expect your refining results to reflect that throughout the year? And then, secondly, on the Toyota MOU, you announced there was a comment in the press release, mentioning that the MOU in the pursuit of hydrogen will leverage existing market positions and assets that Chevron has, can you maybe elaborate on that comment a bit? What market positions or assets are -- or at least the types of market positions and assets that the MOU will leverage? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yes, Jason, I'll be real quick on the second one, because it's early days, it's an MOU, it's really to explore this alliance is to work together to grow the hydrogen business, in passenger vehicles and heavy duty. You'd expect that the focus would be around California, which makes sense. And the reference to assets is like hydrogen, fuel dispensing at some of our service stations. So that's the comment more to come. We're very excited to partner with a great company like Toyota on the fuel cell technology. And you'll hear more over time. In terms of the regional differences, you're absolutely right. There are regional differences. If I contrast first West Coast and Gulf Coast, actually Gulf Coast is a little bit stronger, Florida looks really pretty much back to normal. West Coast, on track with gasoline and diesel really is come on strong. Now the Southern California resurgence, earlier this winter has worked its way through, the rates are very low. And you're seeing that come back to travel strong, again, in the Gulf Coast region, seeing it come back in California, with a little bit weaker we're seeing on the West Coast is because the big airports in San Francisco and LA are such -- are so heavy for international travel that clearly is lagging. Now, hopefully it's coming soon after domestic travel, we saw the announcement in Europe that fully vaccinated Americans could go to Europe this summer. So we'll just see, that's hopefully not too far behind. We saw in China and Australia that domestic travel fully recovered once those countries got their arms around the virus. So I'm confident domestic travel will come back very quickly here in this country. But again, international travel will lag a little bit and we'll just see. Well, in Asia -- Asia is a big, it varies. Some countries have much better control of virus than others. And then, the excess -- some of the new refining capacity in China becomes relevant there. So, the U.S. is strengthened for sure, as I said earlier that with Winter Storm Uri, and you're seeing that in petrochemical too. So I do think second quarter, third quarter are going to look better. It is a global market. So these markets do stay connected Asia has also recovered somewhat and we'll see where the results are over the next few quarters. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : So I just have one question. And I want to revisit this reinvestment topic because it seems pretty influential right now. So as you know, you field a lot of questions about your organic maintenance capital. And then anything inorganic is supposed to be accretive to some metric, whatever people choose. But I think is it fair to say that with Noble what we're seeing is, a flexible strategy to reserve and production management. If you're generating surplus cash, you're building capacity for inorganic ads, to manage sustainability and we should think about it as kind of a multi-faceted approach instead of this siloed point of view that that people seem to be shoehorning you into. Is that fair? Pierre Breber : I think so, Sam. Yes. I mean, when we look at just the organic capital, and you say, again, we were 13 billion and some change, last year, 14 billion, and we had planned to be at 20 billion each year pre-COVID. And that you look, you make that comparison, but to not include the inorganic seems to not tell the whole story and I think you saw that in a lot of reserve replacements of other numbers. And you saw that in our Investor Day, our ability to basically get pretty close to the same production guidance, five years out this year versus where we were last year, is a reflection of greater capital efficiency, but also the Noble transaction now, so that I agree with you. Whether we do that again or not that's a separate question. We again, we don't have to do that we can sustain and grow the enterprise are sustaining CapEx on the upstream side, excluding exploration, how we've defined it is about 9 billion. So we are above that.. Of course, we're investing in Tengiz, which we know is going to result in higher production and much stronger, higher cash flow. So again, we showed a free cash flow growing 10% per year. So I do understand all the questions, I think you are hitting it, it is a little bit focusing on half of the story, you got to look at the whole story. Of course, we're managing the whole company, and again, keeping an eye on long-term value. Operator : We will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Two things one, you haven't talked and I don't perceive this to be an issue, but because based on your costs, I'm just wondering, are you certainly concerned just if you would talk a little bit about OFS potential inflation, both domestic and international? And then, same sort of thing around any raw material shortages and maybe include personnel there? Pierre Breber : Yes, short answer is nothing at this point in time, lots of talk about it. But we are not seeing, request for price increases for that. In terms of inputs, certainly steel prices are up. So that would flow through to our wells and the oil tubulars. And we are seeing this impacts more the downstream, trucker shortages. And so that, in terms of personnel, we're seeing that I think that's in part, the Amazon effect and all the delivery UPS and the rest, pulling a lot of truckers off. So we think that will work itself out. So those are pretty minor and targeted in terms of general oil field services, inflation, not seeing it here in the U.S. or internationally. But, we're cognizant oil prices are higher, and we're certainly hearing the top just not seeing it on the ground. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then, just lastly on and you talked about the new carbonization projects in California. I just wondered, as you transact and sort of jump into more of those? Is that going to be more sort of return based or what is sort of driving, as you see opportunities in that, I just want -- maybe from a broader standpoint, if I could ask. Pierre Breber : Yes. We're very clear that our message and our goal is higher returns lower carbon. And that's true in our conventional business. And that's true in M&A and how we walked away from Anadarko and how we did the Noble transaction. And that's true in energy transition. When you look at hydrogen and carbon capture, you're reviewing those as growth businesses that can do both higher returns and lower carbon. There are other parts of our energy transition strategy, lowering the carbon from our operations, which I mentioned earlier, increasing renewable products, all of those also need to generate return. So we're very clear what we do in the space has to be good for the environment and good for shareholders. And so far, we're able to accomplish both and we think activity will increase going forward. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Green for any additional or closing remarks. Roderick Green : Thanks, Katie. We would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call today. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session and instructions given at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green, please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations, and on the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream, and Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Roderick. We delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, with the highest reported earnings in over a year. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion, or a $1.71 per share. The quarter's results included special items totaling $235 million, including a remediation charge in the Gulf of Mexico and pension settlement costs. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Adjusted return on capital was near 8% and we lowered our net debt ratio to 21%. Strong operating cash flow enabled us to meet Chevron's top financial priorities. Our dividend was up 4%. We continue to execute our efficient capital program and we paid down 2.5 billion of debt. Despite lower year-to-date prices and margins, first half 2021 quarterly average free cash flow is near 2018 levels, primarily due to lower capital and operating costs and contributions from legacy Noble assets. We're maintaining strong capital and cost discipline. CNE is down 32% from a year ago and we are lowering our full year organic CNE guidance to around $13 billion, primarily due to lower spending at TCO and greater capital efficiency across the portfolio. Operating costs are on track with our March 2021 Investor Day guidance of a 10% reduction from 2019. Adjusted second quarter earnings were up 6.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher prices in liftings. Adjusted downstream earnings increased on higher chemicals results, as well as higher refining margins and volumes. All other was roughly unchanged between periods. Compared with the last quarter, adjusted second quarter earnings were up about $1.5 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased primarily on higher commodity prices and higher production in the U.S. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily from strong chemicals results, as well as increased refining margins and volumes. All other charges were roughly flat between quarters and are running ahead of ratable guidance primarily due to tax charges and valuation of stock-based compensation. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full-year guidance is unchanged. I will now pass it over to Jay. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil equivalent production increased 5% compared to a year ago. The increase in production was driven by Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partially offset by normal field declines, price-related entitlement effects, and asset sales. Turning to the Permian, we continue to incorporate greater efficiency into our activities. Even with our reduced activity levels, production is expected to be comparable to last year. Consistent with the guidance we shared in March, we're adding rigs and completion crews in the second half of this year, delivering an expected production rate of over 600,000 Barrels a day by year-end. For 2021, we expect free cash flow, excluding working capital, to exceed $3 billion assuming an average Brent price of $65 a barrel. We're committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our Permian operations. One recent example is our shift from diesel fuel to electricity, and natural gas to power drilling rigs and completion spreads. This reduces emissions, reduces well costs, and takes trucks off the roads. Which results in higher returns and lower carbon. At FGP-WPMP, overall progress is at 84%, with field construction 69% complete. We've recently reviewed our cost and scheduled targets. At this point, the net schedule extension from the pandemic is expected to be roughly a quarter for WPMP and two quarters for FGP. Our cost target remains $45.2 billion, as cost reduction efforts and favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental costs associated with COVID. The COVID costs include mitigation efforts, demob and remobilization costs, as well as the expected schedule extension I just mentioned. Although the total project cost target is unchanged, we have increased the project contingency to $1.9 billion, to recognize a schedule uncertainty associated with the virus and its variants. The project is currently at peak workforce and our primary focus is to mitigate the impact of the virus with vaccinations, testing, and isolation protocols to enable our workforce to achieve its productivity. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore project is being developed as a subsea tie -back to our existing Blind Faith facility. The project recently entered front-end engineering and design and remains on track for a final investment decision next year. Earlier this month, we sanctioned the Whale project, which has the potential for future expansion. Fabrication of the Anchor project remains on track with assembly of the production facility hall underway. In Australia, we have sanctioned the Jansz-IO Compression project, which will support the flow of natural gas to Barrow Island. Repairs to the Gorgon propane heat exchangers are complete, and we now have all 5 operated LNG trains online in Australia. In Colorado, our newest generation of production facilities have eliminated the tanks and flare system to deliver a carbon intensity of only 6 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. The new facilities also have a 60% smaller footprint, higher reliability, and 15% to 20% lower lifecycle costs than a traditional facility design, another great example of higher returns and lower carbon. Back to you, Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks Jay. In May we closed the acquisition of Noble Midstream. With this transaction complete, we have fully integrated Noble and have achieved greater than $600 million dollars in synergies 3 months earlier than previously guided. We also started up a mixed feed cracker at GS Caltex and plan to be at 100% design capacity in the third quarter. The project was completed under budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we're resuming our share repurchase program at a targeted annual rate of $2 billion to $3 billion. This is the rate that we believe is sustainable through the cycle, while continuing to pay down debt. The restart of our program is consistent with our financial priorities and builds on our track record. We have a history of buying back shares consistently in meaningful quantities and at a price close to the daily ratable average over the entire 17-year period. We're continuing to grow lower-carbon businesses. This quarter, we started co-processing bio feedstock at our El Segundo refinery, growing renewable diesel production in a capital-efficient manner by leveraging existing infrastructure. We recently announced an MOU with Cummins to develop commercially viable businesses in hydrogen. Also, we've completed front-end engineering on a carbon capture project for emissions from the gas turbines in one of our California cogeneration facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologies; CO2 concentration, and carbon capture, and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. Finally, yesterday we announced the creation of Chevron New Energies, a new organization reporting directly to the CEO. This is an important step to build fast-growing, profitable, new energy businesses to further advance a lower carbon future. Now, looking ahead. In the third quarter, we expect major turnarounds to reduce upstream production by 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily at TCO, which also reduces our expected curtailments to about 5,000 barrels per day. We expect to make an incremental pension contribution in the third quarter of $500 million. This is a one-time payment in addition to our regular quarterly contributions. With higher operating cash flows, TCO expects to pay back part of its loans this year versus our prior guidance of increasing it's debt. There's no change in TCO's expected dividend this year. We've adjusted the guidance on the affiliate income line to reflect higher expected TCO earnings. Also, we expect higher dividends from CPChem in line with our share of higher earnings. On September 14th, we'll be hosting our Energy Transition Spotlight to provide more details on how we plan to lower carbon intensity in our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We invite you all to join us for this video webcast. Our objective is unchanged, higher returns, lower-carbon. During this quarter, we continue to make progress towards this goal, delivering stronger financial results and achieving important lower-carbon milestones. And with oil prices well above our dividend breakeven, and an industry-leading balance sheet, we will resume share buybacks, sharing part of the cash upside with our investors. With that, I will turn it back to Roderick. Roderick Green : Thanks, Pierre. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open up the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instruction] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning, Pierre. I'm going to pick up where you left off there on capital allocation. You announced that $2billion to $3 billion buyback, which adds about $5 a barrel to your breakeven, which I think is about $50 inclusive of the dividend. Obviously, you want to have this sustainable plan. You've always talked about that. Oil's at 75 now. Help us put this in context. We have $15, $20 a barrel, extra oil price at this point, and your leverage is at 21% net-debt-to-cap. Do you want to keep driving down debt from here, or how are you thinking about things? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Phil. By resuming the program, we'll now be 14 in our last 18 years that we have repurchased shares. So that's more than 3 out of every 4 years. And we're doing it at a level that allows us to continue to pay down debt. As you say, with prices above $70, our debt levels should head below the range I've talked about of 20% to 25%. That 20% to 25% net debt ratio range is really over the cycle, kind of implies prices between 40 and 60, like we talked about during our Investor Day, but again with prices well above that, we should head below the bottom of that range. In terms of the breakeven, I mean, this is our 4th priority from a financial perspective, and so it is -- we feel it's sustainable, we intend to sustain it over the cycle, but I don't necessarily view it as a commitment, like we would say our dividend is, and bake it into the breakeven calculation. But the last thing I'll say is, at our Investor Day we showed that at $60 flat Brent nominal over 5 years, we can generate more than 25 billion of excess cash. That's cash in excess of our capital and our dividend. And so you see us starting this buyback program at 2 to 3 billion a year, it shows that we have more than enough capacity to sustain that at reasonable prices. Phil Gresh : Okay, that makes sense. And then the second question, just on the Capex side of things. The billion dollar reduction, you said it was a combination of Tengiz timing and the efficiencies. Is there any further breakdown you could give of those two factors? I'm trying to think about how some of this might carry forward as we look at the longer-term 14 billion to 16 billion range you've talked about. Pierre Breber : Yeah. Let me start, then I'll pass it over to Jay. We lowered our guidance for this year only to 13 billion. As you say, it's primarily due to lower spend at TCO, and part from work that's being deferred, and then greater capital efficiencies across the portfolio. I think you can view that as about 50-50, as a half project that's being deferred in half, greater capital efficiency. There's no change in our long-term guidance or guidance through 2025 of 14 billion to 16 billion. But Jay, maybe you could talk about some of the ways we're being more capital efficient. Jay Johnson : It's really across the portfolio as Pierre said. But in particular, drilling and completion activities -- the Gorgon Stage 2 Project in Australia has been very efficient and gone ahead of plan from a cost standpoint. The Permian drilling and completion, and other U.S. shale and tight has been very efficient. And then we're seeing just overall good discipline on costs, making sure every dollar count, and it's really consistent with operating, and not only this COVID environment, but operating with a very disciplined mentality throughout the organization. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Phil. Phil Gresh : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a follow up if I could. You guys obviously have the megaprojects to Tengiz as an ongoing development. But the history of these megaprojects has been somewhat troubled by very high costs and Capex. Is Tengiz going to be the last megaproject, do you think? And beyond that, we'd be -- really be looking at the Permian as sort of a fragmented but mega development. Is that what we're looking at and is that how your Capex guidance that you just repeated, is that how that's setup, that we won't see another megaproject developed by you or perhaps by any major western oil? Thanks. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Paul. In the oil industry, you never say never. But look, we've talked before that as we move forward with the asset and the portfolio that we have, the preponderance of our capital, 60% and more, is going to be going into shorter-cycle higher-return projects, which are very quick to bring new production on. We have low pre-productive capital. They tend to be very efficient, and we can adjust based on market conditions and react quite rapidly. But that doesn't mean all of our investment will always be in just short cycle. The Deepwater continues to be an important part of our portfolio. It has very low carbon footprint and it tends to have high returns. And so we've seen projects like Anchor and Whale and Ballymore in the queue. And we'll continue to see those roll-in, but we're going to do that in a very disciplined way. We talked at the Investor Day about how we are taking action to make these capital projects more efficient, more effective. Going to the minimum facility objectives, and really building only what's necessary to deliver the returns that we're looking for. And I think that whole approach, as well as it being a relatively small amount of our capital, is going to lead to much more efficient and higher-return outcomes. Paul Sankey : Thank you very much, Jay. And then the follow-up would be, Pierre, how did you come up with the 2 billion to 3 billion of Buyback annually? Can you just talk about the parameters, maybe the oil price assumptions? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Well, we're thinking of a range of oil prices. We -- I've said in the past, Paul as you know, that we would start a program when we were confident we could sustain it over the cycle through multiple years based on our confidence in excess cash flow and the strength of the balance sheet. And so you certainly consume that both of those criteria have been met. In terms of the level, it is to continue to pay down debt while we are having these prices. It's nothing really more than that. Again, as I said earlier to Phil's question, with prices above 70, our debt -- net debt ratio should be below 20%. And so this is a range that allows us to continue to do that. It also gives us a range to deal with uncertainty. We feel good about the macro, but undoubtedly there's the variants out there that can impact demand and you have OPEC+ still having curtailed volumes. So that flexibility is inherent in the range. It also gives us flexibility to buy more or less, depending on the strength of Chevron's stock price, which we've heard from shareholders who have said they want us to try to beat the daily average. I showed a chart that says, \"We don't buy high, we buy very close to daily average.\" But if we can do a bit better and use some discretion, we've heard from our shareholders that they'd prefer that, so that's the thinking that goes behind the level, the range, and the timing. Paul Sankey : Thank you, Pierre. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Good morning, everybody. Jay, I wonder if I could go to you first please. Maybe a small follow-up, to Paul\u2019s question. It seems to us that there's a lot going on in the Gulf of Mexico that's flying under the radar. You mentioned Ballymore, Whale, and Anchor; you've got Leopard -- you 've got a non-working interest in Leopard and Puma. And a few other things going on. And this obviously has been a legacy infrastructure area for you guys. Very efficient capital tieback opportunities and so on. I just wonder if I could ask you just to give us a quick update as to what your activity level is there and what your longer-term plans are, because it seems there's a lot more going on than perhaps you've laid out for the street at this point. Jay Johnson : Well, the Gulf of Mexico has been an important part of our portfolio for a long time and it continues to be. We're one of the largest lease holders in the Gulf of Mexico. But importantly, what we've been doing is focusing our new lease acquisitions to primarily concentrate in those areas where we already have infrastructure. And as we've talked before, with our focus on returns, we're looking for those opportunities where we can do exploration and if we find something that's normal, it can be tied back into our existing infrastructure much like a Ballymore. If we find something that ends up really big and justifies the greenfield development, we can go the route of a Whale project where we continue to focus on the minimum functional objectives, building facilities that are replicative of nature, so that we are building on the learnings of the past. We've developed the Deepwater asset class, so we're taking learnings from the Gulf of Mexico, from West Africa, from Deepwater Australia, sharing those rapidly between these different asset groups to make sure that we're staying on the forefront of efficiency. We have an exploration program that's laid out. We keep that at a pretty low level these days so that it can be very efficient, very focused. We have a good resource base across the portfolio, but we're always looking for that next high-return, low carbon barrel. And the Gulf of Mexico represents a good hunting ground for that. Doug Leggate : Sorry, Jay. I don't mean to press you, but I mentioned a couple Leopard, Puma and I think you've got Silverback as well. Can you give us an update on those? Jay Johnson : We will release information on those in due course. But at this point in time, we're not sharing information. Doug Leggate : Okay, thanks. Pierre, my quick follow-up is, plenty of cash-flow coming in, extraordinary capital efficiency, as Paul pointed out, not a huge amount of big projects in front of you. Well, what are you thinking currently on M&A? Because clearly, you did a fantastic job incorporating Noble. What's your latest thinking in terms of what [Indiscernible] and use of cash going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Pierre Breber : Well, we're very happy with Noble. As we just said, we declared the integration complete, more than double the initial synergies, completed NBLX, we're the first to announce, first to close, quality assets, low premium, and done at a good time from an exchange ratio perspective. As you know, we're always looking, we have a very high bar and we certainly don't need to do a transaction. We just talked about our portfolio and how we can sustain and grow it in a very capital efficient way. Just the last thing I would say is, and we've shown this -- we don't really view cash as being something that's required to do M&A in our business with oil prices volatility, doing it on a stock basis as we did with Noble makes a lot of sense, it kind of keeps you hedged in case prices go up or down between the buyer and seller. So I wouldn't connect any kind of balance sheet actions as being an indicator one way or the other on M&A. We're going to be disciplined with our capital, it's all capital, whether it's organic or inorganic, and of course, we'll only take action if we see it in the interest of our shareholders. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answers. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Hey, thank you. Jay, the first question is for you on Tengiz. Appreciate the update here. Can you just go through some of the modeling work that you've done to get to that $2 billion of contingency and give investors your latest read in confidence interval around the costs. It seemed like a good update relative to what was feared. And the summer is always so important in Kazakhstan. Just talk about the key things that you are going to be watching for over the next couple of months to ensure that you're on track. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Neil. I'll be happy to. At TCO, the team has just done an extraordinary job of responding to the impact of the virus. And as we said, we've been able to capture cost savings, which have largely offset, along with some of our foreign exchange gains, offset the incremental costs due to COVID. So at this point in time, we've reached our peak workforce on FGP, and so we are maintaining that workforce. It is something where we have to continue to stay focused on mitigations, particularly with the rise in the Delta variant and other variants that we are exposed to. The vaccination program continues to go well, we have 42,000 members of our workforce that have gotten their initial dose and about 30,000 that are fully vaccinated now and we continue to try and work with the Kazak government to increase those numbers. Because we were so successful in completing the fabrication, and that fabrication was done with such high quality, and it's been proven to be now dimensionally accurate, we've had our modules showing up at site within 1 millimeters to 3 millimeters of accuracy on where pipes land and the connections between modules. It's really helped us move forward from that standpoint. All of the modules going through the shipping program to arrive at Tengiz. They've all been successfully moved to site, restacked, and set on their foundations. We have that entire program behind us now. All the heavy equipment for the project has been set on foundations throughout the project, so our Heavy Lift Program is complete and being demobilized. And now we're just focused on the interconnections and the hookup and preparing for the turnover to completions and startup. So normally at this point we would be decreasing our contingency because we have eliminated so many of the traditional risks. But in this case, we've actually increased it to 1.9 billion and that's primarily due to our uncertainty around future impacts from COVID; this pandemic is far from over around the world and so while we're doing well and we've been very successful at mitigating any potential impact through this, as you said, critically important summer, we need to stay that way. We're monitoring our productivity. We're very focused on being capitally efficient here. Our focus is on delivering this project at $45.2 billion. We've allowed the schedule to slip a little bit because it's just too hard to try and catch up. We didn't feel that was a good use of resource, so our predominant focus is on the cost and we're managing the schedule within that cost parameter. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Jay. Following up here on the asset level, can you talk about how you see the cadence of activity in the Permian? You talked about exiting the year close to 600,000 barrels a day. Remind us where you are right now. And do you see the -- do you see the Permian still has a growth engine for you or are you planning on running the business more for free cash flow and with less growth in mind as we think about 2022? Jay Johnson : In the Permian, we currently -- as you know, we scaled back activity significantly last year, and we've maintained a lower-level of activity. But at the same time, even with a constant level of activity, because the efficiency is getting better, we're actually getting more output from those reduced levels. We did add an additional completion crew in July, and we expect to add another one before year-end. Well, we currently have 5 drilling rigs out there, and we expect to add at least 1 or 2 more in late Third Quarter and Fourth Quarter. So we are seeing our activity levels start to increase in the second half as we see markets not imbalanced, but are starting to move in the right direction towards approaching equilibrium. We'll continue to monitor where we are in terms of the overall market signals that come to us. But we're going to continue to be very disciplined and focused. Our returns remain the number 1 objective. We are going to stay disciplined around those returns. But we are moving back into more and more efficient factory drilling again, as opposed to having to be focused on lease retention as we were over the last 18 months or so. So I think the Permian is going to continue to be a critical asset in our portfolio. What we've generated and demonstrated is that we can generate free cash flow while we continue to grow and that's because we maintain that disciplined focus on the balance as we look forward. Pierre Breber : And Neil, in our earnings supplement, we -- a memo item, the Permian unconventional total production, so there's 577,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter. Thanks, Neil. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Pierre. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi, good morning, guys. Pierre Breber : Good morning. Jay Johnson : Good morning. Paul Cheng : 2 questions. In Permian, Jay, when you are looking at what you 're going to do in the next year or the next couple of years, how you -- whether that \u2013 the [Indiscernible] means that whether the market there's still fundamentally long supply or not, does it pay into your decision making process? Jay Johnson : Well, I think, of course, it does. And that's because we're not just being triggered by an instantaneous price or some price threshold to signal a need for more activity. As we've talked about, as we gave you guidance at the Investor Day, we've given you our forward-look of the Permian with the expectations of how markets recover. Now, we've seen demand recover in the marketplace quite rapidly. And in most of the products, other than maybe international jet fuel, we are seeing demand starting to return to pre-pandemic levels. But the supply picture is still a fundamentally oversupplied world and that's why we're being cautious, we're being balanced, and we're going to continue to monitor the market, as we continue to decide how to ramp up our activity levels in the Permian. The Permian has very low carbon intensity, so it's a good place for us to continue to develop new barrels. Not only for us, but for the world, but it also has high returns for us. So it remains a key target for increased capital allocation. But we're not going to be driven by an output target or a production target; we're driven by the opportunity to make returns. Paul Cheng : Maybe let me just ask it in another way, Jay. If you determine next year the market is still fundamentally oversupplied, will you still grow the Permian production? Jay Johnson : We've given you the guidance, we're going to continue to be disciplined as we have in the past and I'd rather not speculate beyond that, Paul. I've given you about as much as our thinking as I can. Paul Cheng : Okay. The 2nd question, I -- actually this is for Pierre. In the next several years, when you are looking at 14 to 16 billion a year in Capex, do you have a target percentage on how much you're going to spend in new ESG initiative and the business? Pierre Breber : Well, yeah. We talked at our Investor Day about 3 billion in total to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow low-carbon businesses. That was through 2028, and in terms of updates to that, I'll wait and put another advertisement for our Energy Transition Spotlight. So that'll be September 14th, that will be webcast to everybody. We will go deeper into our actions to advance a lower-carbon future and we will have more to say then. Paul Cheng : Alright, thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Paul. Operator : We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : Hey, guys. You and your partner recently SID the Whale. Can you help us with some more details, Capex, volumes, anything which will help us model the project a little better so you get credit for it in the estimates? Jay Johnson : Thanks for the question. What I would say is we are not the operator. And so for those types of questions, we like to refer you to the operator is the best source of information for those types of things. I will say Whale is a really good asset. We're happy to invest in this project. We expect low carbon intensity from the action from this asset. We're looking for good returns. It's also based on many of the principles that we have been talking about for better capital efficiency. It's based on a minimum facility objective, where this facility is largely a replica of a previous Gulf of Mexico development. There was great cooperation between Chevron and the Operator to develop just what was the right balance between using exactly what was done before and what enhancements or innovation needed to be incorporated into the facility. So we're quite happy with this project and look forward to seeing it progress. But I'll refer you to the Operator for the details. Manav Gupta : My quick follow-up here is, CPChem mostly was very strong in the quarter. My question is, at one point, you and Qatar Petroleum were actually looking build 2 JV crackers and then obviously the pandemic happened. And so how should we think about those crackers. Are -- is there a possibility they can be brought back on the table given the tightness you're seeing in ethylene chain margins or should we think about them as projects which might not be pursued ever? Pierre Breber : We're continuing to advance those projects. And when I say \"we\", I mean our joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company in partnership with the Qatar, as you said. I'd say the Gulf Coast project is a bit ahead. SID was completed late last year, and then we're working together on determining the next steps, including when a final investment decision will occur. And we continue to advance the project and Ross to fund. They both are very competitive projects that work off of low-cost feedstock -- ethane feedstock. Their advantage, we think, relative to others around the world. At the same time, in Aveeno it is tight right now with strong demand, tight inventories in some of the carry-on effects from Winter Storm Uri. But we are seeing capacity additions coming on in the medium-term. And so Mark Nelson, our Head of Downstream, and his team are focused on having very capital efficient projects. So it's not enough to just have the ethane feed advantage, but it's having a really capital and cost efficient development. And that's what the teams are working on. Manav Gupta : Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Manav. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one's on Abgami. One of your peers highlighted a redetermination of the Abgami field in Nigeria, and you're a majority owner. There's actually limited details on this upside of the headlines, but would you be able to confirm whether this impacted you, or you had any change in ownership in that field, and whether there's any cash impact in the second quarter? And then I have a follow-up on a different topic. Pierre Breber : Yeah, we won't comment specifically on that barrage. It's commercially sensitive, we've had a longstanding practice of not discussing commercially sensitive matters. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay, fine. 2nd question is actually just a more general question on inflation. Would you be able to talk about across services in raw materials and whatnot and what you are seeing -- any worrying signs of inflation across the portfolio? Pierre Breber : We are not. We've talked in the past about isolated areas. I mean, for example, steel costs that go into our tubulars and our wells is up, but it's a fairly -- is a small component of a well cost, maybe about 10%. We certainly are seeing tightness in trucking services that has impacted us at time and some wage labor cost increases there, but I think there is more talk about it than we're seeing in terms of action. I'd say our COGS is pretty well under control in the upstream and downstream segments. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks. Thanks, Biraj. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Hi, good morning. Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about in terms of the new energy's business. Curious, as you go further down this road, and build out this business plan, you're seeing -- there just seems to be a consistent theme here, which is policy frameworks and different geographies and are they conducive to actually building a business? And so curious to your perspective on finding enough high return businesses that have the right market and policy framework today versus some of the things that you might have to wait on and just in the context of making sure you don't tie up some capital on some things that have some externality. So just curious on that point. Pierre Breber : Well, we operate in California which has a lot of policy support in this area, and we have -- we're the leading downstream player here with a leading brand and have a large upstream business. But you're right, policy does vary, but there's enough policy to advance these businesses. Now, there are 2 main parts to our lower-carbon activities. The first is to lower the carbon intensity of our operations, and that's -- largely does not inherent on policy or at least certainly the first steps. We put out a 2028 target that has a 35% reduction to 24 kilograms per barrel, and that's something we're taking action on. And then we're also advancing lower-carbon businesses. The announcement yesterday was really focused on hydrogen carbon capture. Our downstream team is advancing renewable fuels, we've talked about renewable natural gas and renewable diesel previously. What we are trying to do around lower-carbon really is connected to our assets, capabilities, and customers. So one thing we're not doing in lower-carbon is large scale wind and solar. We're certainly having renewable power supply or operations again, part of lowering the carbon intensity, but not pursuing it as a standalone business. That's a decision that we're making because we don't feel like we have the competitive advantage. But when we get to renewable fuels, like renewable natural gas, renewable diesel, sustainable jet, hydrogen, carbon capture, these are areas that are adjacent to our business where, again, we have capability, we have customers, and we have assets that we can leverage. We sell to United Airlines. United Airlines is going to buy a sustainable jet. Sustainable jet is going to be a percentage of jet for some time period, 2%, 5%, 10% mix with conventional. We're the natural player in that space, so again, we'll share more on September 14th, but that's a little taste of what you should expect from us. Stephen Richardson : Great, thanks very much. I appreciate the clarity. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you very much. I think the question for Jay is you've referenced a couple of times carbon intensity around projects and I think your -- the operator on Whale highlighted it in the FID statement. I just wonder whether you could talk a little about that. I was struck actually by the comments you made in the prepared remarks around the Colorado very, very low carbon emissions by BOE. Few things, one is, can you talk about how you feature carbon emission profiles into your FID process at alongside traditional MPVs, IRRs, payback periods, etc. And secondly, whether as you look at your portfolio, as it stands right now, which obviously been built up over years and decades. Whether there's work that can be done around it that both source for lower carbon emissions and actually is, I think Pierre referenced, if you're adding renewables as a power source, whether you can actually also make an economic return as well, in conjunction with that. Jay Johnson : Thanks for the question. A pretty broad question, so I'm going to start broad, but then I'll focus in on the Gulf of Mexico. In the upstream portfolio as we take stock of where we are as Chevron, our entire upstream portfolio, as best we can determine, sits at roughly half of the industry average for carbon intensity worldwide, so we're starting from a good position. We've been very focused on starting to bring our carbon down for some time now and so we set our initial goal back in 2016 for carbon intensity reduction for the upstream. Since 2016, we've actually reduced our flaring by 60% and our methane emissions by 50% and we've done that largely through what we call the marginal abatement cost curves. And just as we do in exploration, we don't have every business unit out there making their own independent decisions, but rather they bring their ideas for carbon reduction investments to the center, and then we look across the entire enterprise, not just upstream, but upstream and downstream, midstream, and we invest into those opportunities that give us the greatest carbon reduction for the least amount of capital. And that's in keeping with our focus on being a higher return Company. What we've been able to find so far is that the projects have been relatively low-hanging fruit. And so we've seen these big reductions in carbon that's occurred since 2016, and in fact, we reached our 2013 targets, sorry 2023 targets in 2020, 3 years ahead of schedule. And so we've already set new targets which we talked to you about at the Investor Day in March for 2028. And that's the path that we're working towards now, and that's to get down to an average of 24 kilograms of CO2 per barrel, equivalent across the entire portfolio. Places like the DJ basin, where some of the Noble teams have done a great job of designing out the parts of the process that have the highest emissions, have resulted in those huge gains. And so, as we said, not only are we seeing a 15 to 20% lower lifecycle cost, we're seeing high reliability, 60% footprint reduction, and they're down in the 6 kilogram per CO2 per barrel equivalent range, which is tremendous. To put that into comparison, the entire Gulf of Mexico, our operations last year in 2020, we're at 7 kilograms per CO2. And that's why we think it's so important there's good information for policymakers to understand that places like the Gulf of Mexico allow us to produce a very critical supply of energy to the U.S. and to the world, but also do that in a very carbon-efficient manner. In terms of our decision-making, these are all elements that we have to balance as we make investment decisions. But we are bringing these factors and these criteria into the equation as we evaluate where we are going to allocate capital and how we're going to move forward. Jon Rigby : That's great. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jon. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the buyback, if I recall correctly, last year, there was concern around what OPEC+ would do, and that factored into both your shareholder distribution strategy as well as your Permian production strategy. Are you kind of confident now that OPEC+ is going to continue to manage the market and did that factor in to your strategy or your decision to resume buybacks or were those kind of looked at independently? And then secondly, just a clarification on TCO FGP. Can you remind us what the free cash flow flip is from, I guess 2022, which is the last full year of project spend, to 2024 when the project is fully up and running? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jason. I'll start with the second one. We haven't given asset level free cash flow guidance for TCO. You're absolutely right that you will see increased dividends from Tengiz, from our ownership interest in TCO, both as capital rolls off and as the project starts up. It's a big part of the Company's guidance of 10% annual free cash flow that's between now and 2025. A lot of that comes from the Permian, a lot of it comes from Tengiz. And as you also know, we'll get the loans repaid back. That shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but it's still cash. So there's nothing asset-specific that we've shared, but it's included in our overall free cash flow guidance that I'll refer you to our Investor Day. And perhaps as we get closer to the startup, we can share that in a more specific way for you all. In terms of the share buyback, again, we look at those criteria; are we comfortable we can sustain it -- confident we can sustain it over the cycle. There are uncertainties I cited, the Delta variant as an uncertainty and OPEC+. So if OPEC+ are going to take the actions that are in their interest. We don't have any greater insight into that. It is an uncertainty. But we have enough confidence in all the investments and assets that Jay has been talking about, the strong downstream in chemicals performance that we've seen, the economic recovery that we've seen, the discipline on the supply side that we've seen from the companies in this country and really around the world, that we feel good that we can keep this program in place for multiple years and also pay down debt while we're doing it. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. Pierre Breber : Thanks Jason. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on some of the balance sheet conversation from earlier. I know, Pierre, you said that this is one of those times that with the oil price where it is, you 're likely to trend below the 20-25% debt target -- net debt target. But is there a floor on the debt level in terms of the balance sheet where you start to feel like you're underlevered at some point either from an absolute debt level point of view, from a debt-to-cap point of view, or even from like an efficient retirement of debt point of view that would start to skew access cash more towards buyback or dividend growth? Pierre Breber : Well, there is. I won't cite a number and it's because we don't have one internally. I mean, there's no hard and fast number, but undoubtedly, with the flexibility of our capital program, with the cash flow generation. I mean, the reason why that -- I've cited that 20% to 25% range, which is arguably higher maybe than we would have had at 5 years ago when we had a lot of long dated capital projects and you would have wanted -- we would have wanted and had, in fact, the debt level quite a bit lower because we had long dated commitments. We are, as we talked about earlier, getting to the -- near the end or a couple of years away from Tengiz being completed. The vast majority of our capital program is much more flexible. That gives us this higher range. I'd like to get comfortably below it. If you're asking the question, would we increase the share buybacks? Yes. That's absolutely possible. If we get our debt ratio comfortably below the 20%, and then we look out, again in terms of our cash flows, we can increase the range. We showed the history of our share buybacks. We haven't kept it at the rate that we've started it at. We've increased it. At times, we've decreased it, and so you'd expect us to continue to do the same thing. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. And maybe a separate follow-up on Energy Transition activities. You've continued to be fairly active in renewable natural gas. You've done a modest amount. I know you mentioned some co-processing and renewable diesel, or maybe we just don't have a lot of detail on it yet, but how are you thinking about the opportunity set as you look down the lines for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel? Would you consider doing something more meaningful, including the potential conversion of an asset or likely focus on smaller steps like coprocessing? Pierre Breber : Well, again, we'll share more at the Spotlight. The co-processing that we just started -- it's a 2-stage process, so it will be up to have a capacity of up to 10,000 barrels a day by year-end. So we kind of brought on the first phase as another phase. We'll be the first U.S. refinery to co process through an FCC in the second phase, and again, that will give us the capability to produce up to 10,000 barrels a day. We did it this way in part because it's very capital efficient. We are leveraging existing kit; it's literally just a tank and some pipes. And so we can do this in a very capital efficient way. There's undoubtedly growth in renewable diesel on the demand side. There is also growth on the supply side. Renewable markets work in commodity markets just like the conventional products do. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined in how we approach it. And so this is a very competitive project, and I think you'll see more from us again when we talk about it on the Spotlight on September 14th. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks, Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Thanks. How are you? Just one for me on LNG as an asset class in the context of low carbon. I'm pretty sure it would be below your target on a per unit basis, but gas prices are very high globally, LNG prices are very high. There's some opportunities out there in LNG and I'm just wondering on Chevron's official position on how that marries with your broader emissions targets. Jay Johnson : Well, this is certainly a part of -- when we look at our portfolio, we consider the LNG assets and production to be part of the upstream. That's in all of the numbers that we've given you. And we continue to look for opportunities to make those operations more efficient and lower-carbon intensity. We think natural gas is an important fuel. It's an important transition fuel. It's going to play a critical role as the world continues to lower its overall carbon footprint. And so we are going to stay focused on incrementally increasing capacity of our existing facilities. We'll look at the opportunities to use existing oil age, or upcoming oil age in other facilities to increase our production through those facilities. But most importantly, we want to leverage the investments that we've already made to continue to focus on higher returns as we go forward. So it's a part of the portfolio, but it doesn't occupy any particular premium or special place. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks Sam. Operator : Our last question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Good morning all. My one question is just really on protection. You guys in the past, you use interest rate swaps and other factors. Just wondering, there's a lot of discussion these days about hedges and all. I'm just wondering -- obviously, you've got a fantastic balance sheet where nobody worries on that side. But just wondering your policy and strategies, how you think about various protection, as I mentioned, interest rate swaps, hedges, all the above. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Well, on the commodity price side, we don't have, except for transportation, but we don't have flat price commodity hedges. And in terms of our debt, I mean, we tend to have a fair amount of variable debt or short-term debt, a commercial paper and others, but undoubtedly we also have some term debt that's fixed. I think our average interest cost is around 2%, our mix is probably less than half variable. But as you say, we have very strong credit, very strong balance sheet, and so we don't pay for a lot for insurance and we don't think our shareholders want that. I think our shareholders want certain exposure to commodity prices so they enjoy the upside and then they want us to maintain a strong balance sheet. Thanks, Neil. Neal Dingmann : No, absolutely. Thank you. Roderick Green : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call today. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron 's third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP of Downstream and Chemicals; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Roderick. We reported third quarter earnings of $6.1 billion or $3.19 per share, highest reported earnings in more than eight years. Adjusted earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.96 per share. The quarter's results included two special items : asset sale gains of $200 million and pension settlement costs of $81 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Adjusted ROCE was greater than 13% and we lowered our net debt ratio to below 19%. Strong operating cash flow enabled us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the resumption of share repurchases. Compared to before COVID, operating costs are down, upstream production is up, and we're much more capital efficient. Cost efficiency and capital efficiency are essential to navigate commodity price cycles. Providing resilience through the low periods and leveraging upside when markets are strong. This has been evident over the past several quarters, and especially so in the most recent one, as we generated Company record free cash flow higher than the strongest quarters in 2008 and 2011 when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel. Adjusted earnings -- adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year; primarily on higher prices, margins, and volumes. Compared with last quarter, adjusted third quarter earnings were up almost $2.5 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased on higher realizations and positive timing effects primarily related to managing LNG portfolio pricing exposure. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining and marketing margins. The all other variance was positive due to lower corporate charges and the use of deferred tax assets, which previously had evaluation allowance. Third quarter oil equivalent production increased 7% year-over-year due to the Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partly offset by price-related entitlement effects and asset sales. I'll now pass it over to Mark. Mark Nelson : Thanks, Pierre. In downstream and chemicals, we delivered our best adjusted earnings in more than four years. Demand for our product is strong, with recovery of jet fuel sales expected as international travel gradually returns. And while the improving market environment helps, we're focused on what we can control. Safe and reliable operations, capital and cost efficiency and value chain optimization, to drive higher returns. Some examples of our self-help actions include : using digital tools to improve planning, scheduling, and prioritization of maintenance activity, leveraging data analytics and asset flexibility to increase margins, and adopting new technology like robotic inspection in maintenance procedures. During our Investor Day in March, I highlighted that self-help is expected to drive higher returns for Downstream and Chemicals. We're on track to meet that guidance with benefits already flowing to the bottom line. Chemicals performance is also strong, as CPChem responds to current market conditions while continuing to keep a focus on longer-term unit cost reduction. GS Caltex reached 100% design capacity of its mixed feed cracker ahead of schedule and under budget. The CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast II Project continues to advance towards a final investment decision in a disciplined way that positions the project to earn attractive returns through the cycle. And Ras Laffan Project is in FEED and we continue to evaluate this project. We believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals, our investment focus continues to be on the low end of the supply cost curve, advantage feed stock, competitive capital and cost structure, and strong project execution. Since our energy transition spotlight, we closed the acquisition of an equity interest in American natural gas and its network of 60 CNG retail sites with our partner, Mercuria, enabling us to meet customers\u2019 needs beyond California. We're also delivering first gas through our Brightmark partnership and all CalBioGas farms are now online. We sold the first sustainable aviation fuel produced from our El Segundo Refinery to Delta Airlines at LAX. And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Neste's Group 3 base oil business and its next base brand. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition is expected to provide a capital efficient approach to expand our base oil offerings. And coupled with Novvi's renewable products, position Chevron to be the supplier of choice to meet customers' needs now and into the future. Back to you, Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mark. We recently released an updated climate change resilience report, which includes a stress tests and portfolio under IEA's Net Zero 2050 scenario. A new target called portfolio carbon intensity, that includes Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products and Chevron 's Net Zero 2050 aspiration for Upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions. I encourage everyone to read our latest report available on our website. Now looking ahead. In the fourth quarter, we expect lower production due to a planned turnaround at Wheatstone, which was completed last week and repairs at the Alba gas plant and Equatorial Guinea. In addition, our participation in Rokan PSC in Indonesia ended in August. Production from Rokan averaged 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent year-to-date. We expect earnings from JKM-related spot sales out of Australia to increase around $50 million from three quarter -- from third quarter, due to fewer spot cargoes as our long-term customers increased deliveries heading into winter. We're also expecting three discrete cash items, the return of capital from Angola LNG, TCO's first dividend in several years, and a federal income tax cash refund. There are no P&L impacts from these items. During 4Q, we expect to buy back shares at the high end of our guidance range. Finally, we're lowering our full-year C&E guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion, primarily due to COVID-related project spend deferrals into next year, lower non-op CapEx in the Permian, and continued capital efficiencies. To wrap up the quarter, we continue to make progress towards our objective of higher return, lower carbon. We're more capital and cost efficient, generated record free cash flow, and are taking actions to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We're executing a straightforward strategy that's expected to deliver value now and well into the future. With that, I will turn it back over to Roderick. Roderick Green : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get to all your questions. Please open up the lines, Katie. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin Mcdermott : Good morning. Congrats on the great results. So my first question, Pierre, I think is for you. I just wanted to ask for a little bit more detail on the reduction in the capital spending guidance for this year. It sounds like it's a mix of different factors. Some of it's deferrals next year, some of it's a mix of non-op and efficiency gains. Can you just bridge the delta a little bit more detail for us and also talk about whether or not these deferrals or how these deferrals impact planned 2022 spend? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Devin. We lowered our CapEx guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion. That's from our budget of $14 billion, and from our revised guidance that we had in the second quarter of $13 billion. So in the last quarter, what's changed -- while we continue to see non-op spend in the Permian below our expectations, we did have some deferred major capital project spending tied to Hurricane Ida and the Delta variant wave. And then we've seen -- continue to see continued capital efficiency across in the Permian and across the portfolio.  It does not change our CapEx guidance -- our CapEx guidance for next year and through 2025 is $15 billion to $17 billion. We do expect higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and next year. The low end of that range is about a 20% increase from the midpoint of our revised guidance. So these deferrals are very manageable. And again, I would think from the original $14 billion budget, about half, you can think of a deferral and half I would say is capital efficiency and cost-savings what we're getting, the same results at -- for less capital. Devin Mcdermott : Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And then my follow-ups on cash returns. So very strong free cash flow in the quarter. Your debt target is now below the bottom end of your target range. It's good to see the increase in the cadence of the buyback in 4Q, I guess my question is, what are some of things you're looking for to further increase that buyback target back to something closer to the pre-COVID run rate? Pierre Breber : As you said, Devin, our guidance for fourth quarter is at the high end of the range, so that's a 3 billion annual rate or 750 million in the quarter. And as I said, last quarter, and I'll restate now, we'll increase the buyback range, when Chevron's net debt ratio was comfortably below 20%. We ended three -- third quarter with a net debt ratio, a little bit under 19%, down from 21% at the end of the second quarter. So we just got below 20%, but we're fast approaching a net debt level where we could increase the buyback range further. As a reminder, Devin, I know, you know this, we intend to maintain our buyback for multiple years through the cycle. And so we're positioning our balance sheet below our mid-cycle range, so that will enable us to continue buybacks even if the cycle turns. Devin Mcdermott : Got it. Very helpful, makes sense. Congrats again on the strong quarter. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Devin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes, I just want to echo great results here. Pierre, I want you to take a moment to talk about the global gas market. You spend a lot of time looking at this over the years. How do you see it playing out from here? And there a lot of moving pieces as it relates to your gas portfolio. But one would be just any thoughts around spot cargos and the other would be it looked like you had some timing effects in the quarter that supported earnings. I would think that would unwind later on, but just any modeling advice there. So a lot of moving pieces there, but your thoughts on the cash portfolio. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Neil. First, I'd say that we are seeing high gas prices. It does feel more cyclical than structural. We've seen demand very resilient through COVID on natural gas, in particular, and supply has been impacted in part by lower associated gas, just a slowdown in some supply activities. So seeing demand and supply a little bit out, I don't think it's something that we've seen in the past and we expect that markets will work. We're seeing a commodity pricing right now, and we expect markets to rebalance over time. We have a very strong natural gas business. We have a nice position in North America, Australia, Eastern Med through Noble Energy, and in Africa. And so we're well-positioned there. There's not much in the short-term that we can really do to increase supply. We have position in the Haynesville and we could increase activity there. But that will have a modest impact on a Company of our size. I think over the medium to longer-term, we're working expansion opportunities and particularly in Eastern Med, and I think this is positive for signing up customers and enabling kind of the next, next phase of expansion there. So it's something that we're certainly well positioned for and we're looking to expand supply into it. In terms of the quarter, a couple of things. Yes, we did have a trading timing effect that was related to LNG. And that's really tied to how we manage our overall portfolio pricing, so we have customer contracts that are oil-linked and JKM linked, and then we have various supplies and we try to match up the pricing, And in order to do that, we essentially, went along with some JKM paper, which clearly was mark-to-market positive in the quarter. Now, that's going to be matched against some physical deliveries in future quarters. So we call that timing because we expect to see that unwind when those physical cargoes are delivered. And then the last piece of guidance we had was really on fourth quarter earnings effects. We guided towards $50 million of increased earnings in 4Q versus 3Q from Australia LNG spot cargoes. And that's just to make the point that we are going to have spot cargoes. We have all five trains operating, the Wheatstone plan turnaround is complete. And we'll have actually more cargoes delivered in fourth quarter when you think of contract and spot. But because it's heading into winter and most of our -- many of our customers on the Northern Hemisphere, their nomination seasonally pick up heading into the winter. And so they will have higher takes under the long-term contracts which are oil linked. And that means we will fewer cargoes getting the higher JKM prices. So higher prices clearly in JKM, 4Q versus 3Q, fewer cargoes, that's a net benefit of about 50 million. We also have some exposure out of our -- both Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea, and so you can think about another 50 million or so from spot cargoes from those operations. So, sorry it's a long answer to cover the full breadth of natural gas this quarter. Neil Mehta : No, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. Now, that's great. And Pierre, you're tracking really well on CapEx this year, now, I think, initially 14 then 13 now, it looks like as low as 12. Next year, if I remember, CapEx is 15 to 17 is the range that you talked about. Are -- is it fair to assume that the lower capital spend this year would suggest that you'd be on the lower end of that range? And any moving pieces that we should think about as you set up the 2022 spend level? Pierre Breber : You will see us increase capital in the fourth quarter just to get to that $12 billion to $13 billion because we're at $8.1 billion through third quarters. And you'll see that in the Permian, two more rigs, two more completion crews. We'll have higher activity levels at Tengiz. We're going to maintain peak manpower through the winter. And then activity tends to be back-loaded, so -- back-end loaded. So we have some project milestone payments, we have exploration wells that we'll be drilling in the fourth quarter.  So you'll see an increase in fourth quarter. I think we will announce our 2022 budget in December like we normally do. It'll be within the guidance and I think it's fair to say it will be towards the low end of the guidance. Again, even being at the bottom of the guidance of $15 billion of organic capital, that's at least a 20% increase off the midpoint of the guidance we just gave for this year. So, again, I don't want to get ahead of that, but you should expect us to see capital in the lower end of that guidance range. Neil Mehta : Good stuff. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Well, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Pierre Breber : Good morning. Doug Leggate : Pierre and Mark, thanks for taking my questions. Pierre, I hate to ask a housekeeping question, but you've got to help me out here a little bit on tax. The way I'm thinking about this is that there's been a lot of changes and post-Noble. Your mix has changed and obviously we've got a lot more profitability in the U.S. with overall tax rates. So can you help me? Is what's going on the tax sustainable or is there a mix issue or is there something unusual going on because as we saw your tax rate going up? I'm worried that we are carrying too high a tax rate going forward. Pierre Breber : The tax benefits in the third quarter which we cited are real. So this is a deferred tax asset. It was acquired through Noble. At the time of closing the transaction, we put a valuation allowance against it because these taxes attributes have a -- they expire after a certain number of years, and based on projections of financial performance at that time, we thought they would expire without us being able to use them. Our financial performance is so much stronger that we actually were able to use them in the third quarter. So that reduces our taxes both on an earnings and on a cash basis.  So it's very real and it's an additional synergy from Noble and it's not something that was included in our synergy estimates. That is not something that necessarily will recur, we'll do a review of all of our tax attributes at year-end, and see again what differed tax assets could have value going forward based on a change in condition. But, again, I would cite that, that was in the all other segment. It's not something that you would expect to recur. Doug Leggate : That's really helpful, thanks. And then I suppose I can push you to quantify what our noble contribution was, right? Pierre Breber : Well, it's the primary variance in that segment. So we talked about lower corporate charges and tax benefits. Doug Leggate : All right. My follow-up is really on balance sheet issue, but obviously going back 5 years ago, you guys [ inaudible 00 :19:55] net debt as this is leaving a lot of projects going quiet back then. When you think about the cost of debt, which is obviously very, very low, and we'll see if it stays there, versus the way you think about per-share dividend growth. So I'm trying to think, Exxon talks now about 20% to 25% has been the right level for them. Excuse me, your head around, below that kind of level so what is the right level for you, given that, you can obviously refinance at very economic level and obviously, step up for buybacks, if you chose to. Pierre Breber : When I became CFO, we -- I answered this question that we didn't have a hard target on our net debt ratio, but 20% to 25% is a good place for us to be through the cycle. And there could be times where we go above it. For example, when we showed our stress test, the only Company in the industry to show a stress test last year at $30 brand for two years, to give confidence our investors that we could maintain the dividend, our net debt ratio did go above 25%. So that's appropriate. We do not need to be anywhere close to where we were before with no net debt. But when prices are above mid-cycle, we should be below the low end of the range. And we are. We got to less than 19% now, and we're fast approaching a range where we could increase our buyback -- our buyback guidance. So it's very close to where we're at. All the excess cash that we'll be generating under these conditions, and we showed that at $60 even, prices well below where we're at now, that we can generate $25 billion of excess cash over 5 years. This is cash in excess of our capital and our dividends. All that cash will be returned to shareholders over time in the form of a rising dividend. And again, our dividend is up 12% since pre - COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. And a buyback that's rateable and we maintain through the cycle. We buy back shares 14 and last 18 years. And so when we set a buyback rate, we intend to maintain it through the cycle. That means we will maintain it when the cycle turns, and which means that we can in fact be doing it off of debt for some time period, and we'll rebalance back into the range, when we continue to buy back shares, when -- if and when the cycle does turn down. Doug Leggate : Let's hope that's not anytime soon because last year is still -- we still got scars from last year Pierre. Thanks so much for your answers. I appreciate it. Pierre Breber : Thank you, Doug. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Pierre Breber : Morning Wai. Jenny Wang : Good morning. We wanted to follow-up on Devin's question and I guess Dave's question as well, getting back to the buyback. Pierre, you have already commented that you plan to maintain the buyback through multiple years through the price cycle, which is great. I think we remember prior commentary that the goal is to not have to reduce the buyback once it's started. So we wanted to just check in on that and how you think that the trajectory of any buyback increases. It sounds more ratable versus opportunistic. We know there's a tremendous amount of free cash flow coming your way, but also it seems like investor expectations are running alongside that versus being more ratable, and that the strip is backward dated. So we just wanted to check on the trajectory. Pierre Breber : Thanks Janeen, if you look back to our history, we've never ended a buyback program at the rate that we started. We tend to have increased them. And I think you might be right that we haven't decreased them. Look, I'm not opposed to that. We have a range. We're using the range. We were in the middle of the range in the third quarter. It's the first quarter that we -- since we've resumed buybacks. We bought back shares in the first quarter of last year, pre-Covid. And now we're using the top of the range.  And as I said, we're fast approaching a net debt level, where we can increase that guidance range further. So no, our focus is on being ratable and maintain it through the cycle. Investors -- our investors, our shareholders, have different views on buybacks where we have the most common ground, is do it consistently, and do it through the cycle when times are good and when times are tougher. And so we're setting the rates at a level that we have confidence that we can maintain it through a commodity price cycle. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great, thank you for that. Our second question is really on the Permian and the outlook on capital allocation. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on inventory and supply demand, and maybe how close are you to potentially accelerating in the Permian, a little bit beyond of what you've already laid out? And I guess on that, we know that it doesn't get much attention, but could you also be thinking about increasing activity in other short-cycle plays? Thank you. Pierre Breber : We're going to increase capital in the fourth quarter and into next year. And so that'll be in the Permian and they'll be in other locations. Again, as I said, even the bottom end of our guidance range $15 billion represents at least a 20% increase from where we expect to end up this year. And we're seeing that in the fourth quarter. We'll see 2 additional rigs in Permian, 2 additional completion crews. We are beginning to see a non-op pickup, also, again, that's part of the reason why we lowered our guidance. Non-op has been a bit below our expectations. And you can see it in other basins. We have a great portfolio with a number of short-cycle investments, but we're not changing our overall CapEx guidance range. Our CapEx guidance anticipated that we would be in a recovery mode and it would increase overtime.  And we showed a 5 year outlook on the Permian that shows that we can grow production as an outcome of a very capital efficient and -- but also carbon efficient development of resource that we can grow that production from 600,000 barrels a day to 1 million barrels a day. So we're executing our plan. There's really no change in what we're doing. It's playing out the way we expected. And seeing a buildup in activity in the Permian and across other parts of our portfolio is what we had planned to do and we're going to do that in a very capital and cost efficient way. Jenny Wang : Great, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, Pierre. First question here, just kind of circling around the capital allocation piece a little bit more. Back in March, you talked about having 25 billion of excess cash or greater than 25 billion in excess cash over 5 years at 60, implicitly suggesting the dividend would be covered around 50-ish brands I believe. I'm just curious if as you progress through this year, the performance that you've seen etc., has anything changed with that, to make you think that that break in would be moving lower, or is that still an area where you're comfortable with? Pierre Breber : That's an area where we're comfortable with. It's just keeping oil prices constant, right? We're seeing Mark Nelson 's Downstream & Chemicals Group perform very well. We've talked about natural gas pricing being strong both in North America, Europe, and International LNG. So those things aren't held constant. So if you look at this quarter's result, I think you'd see our break-even would be a little bit lower, but in terms of mid-cycle assumptions for refining margins, chemical margins, natural gas prices, and then an oil break even about 50 is certainly where we're at.  Now that -- of course that changes as our dividend goes up and other things over time because it's a dividend break-even is covering our capital and our dividend. But that math is still intact. We are a better Company than we were a few years ago. We showed that chart where our costs are lower, our production is higher, and we're much more capital efficient. We can sustain and grow this enterprise with less capital and that helps us deliver higher returns and lower carbon. Phil Gresh : Got it. And then just a follow-up question on Wheatstone, there were some reports from your partners about reserves being written down there. I just wanted to get your commentary, how do you think about this? Does that mean something in terms of future capital requirements, given that it's a longer cycle project as any commentary you'd have there? Thanks. Pierre Breber : It's unrelated to Chevron. So if you recall, the Wheatstone Project was the 1st project in Australia and maybe the world where there were third-party. The reserves, the resources came from two different joint ventures. And so it was Apache at the time and now it's Woodside. So it was really Woodside announcing that the fields that supply their portion of -- that's told through Wheatstone, that those reserves have a write-down. Chevron does not have an interest in those reserves so the fields -- the Chevron fields that supply Wheatstone are not affected. And again, it's unrelated to Chevron activity. It's only that they essentially -- we share the facility through them and those fields are also being processed through. Wheatstone is doing very well. We had a plan turnaround that covered a portion of third quarter and early into fourth quarter, as I said it was completed last week, and we expect to have all 5 of our Australia trains operating this quarter. And as I said, we expect more cargoes. There is a lot of focus on JKM, but of course our oil-linked contract prices will also be higher because they adjust with -- oil prices are higher, and then they adjust with oil prices on a 3-month to 6-month lag. Phil Gresh : Great, thanks for the clarification there. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Phil, Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe a high level question and you did your energy transition spotlight event a little while back. You said a share of the capital budget at close to local run businesses, being close to 10% of the capital budget. You've seen one of your peers here in the U.S. raise theirs to a similar level. If you think about the feedback that you've received since then, our view was that it was a pragmatic balance between allocation of capital towards good low-carbon businesses but not too much to kind of protect returns dilution going forward. Is 10% of the budget do you see as -- as you've seen feedback over the last couple of months, do you view that 10% of the budget is enough, or do you think that's going to be something where you're going to see increasing pressure to kind of creep that higher going forward. Pierre Breber : I'll start and then I'll ask Mark to talk a little bit about some of our renewable fuels activities in his portfolio. We have good shareholder support in alignment for our strategy and objectives of high returns, lower carbon. That's both lowering the carbon intensity of our traditional operations and then growing low-carbon businesses that leverage our strengths, our capabilities, assets, and customer relationships. And they target the sectors that cannot be easily electrified, the hard to abate sector. So this is things like air travel, industrial emissions, heavy-duty transport.  The $10 billion of capital is connected to some pretty ambitious targets that go up to 2030. So 150,000 tons per annum of hydrogen, 25 million tons per year of carbon capture and storage. That's all consistent with that capital guidance. So we are more in the execution mode and getting it done versus, let's say competing on CapEx targets. It's not easy to do, these are ambitious targets. They have challenges, lots of opportunity, but let me ask Mark to talk a bit about his portion of that on renewable fuels. Roderick Green : Thanks for the question, Ryan. I could use a real tangible example. You think about our El Segundo Refinery in our diesel hydrotreater conversion. We've said a few things are really important to us when it comes to renewable diesel. We've said that the ability to sell it at the appropriate margin, the ability to have the right kind of feedstocks, and the ability to be capital efficient is critical for us to be successful. In Southern California, in the El Segundo Refinery are an example of all of that. We've already increased our sales -- we're getting close to 40%, let's say over 30% of renewable and biodiesel in Southern California. We have our Bungie joint venture, where we're working towards definitive agreements as we speak, and yet they're already supplying us at the El Segundo Refinery. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, Mark Nelson : capital efficiency. We indicated in our energy transition spotlight that we expect to be a leader in the capital conversion of particular hydroprocessing units in our system. And we believe we can do that for less than a dollar per gallon of annual capacity. And that's including any pretreatment requirements, that gives us the ability to produce both renewable diesel and conventional diesel just with a catalyst change, if that's necessary. So when you step back and you think about that work that's been done initially at El Segundo where we did our co-processing investment for very, very little money, we were able to test tanking and piping and metallurgy needs, and now we're working towards a full conversion of that diesel hydrotreater here by the end of next year. That won\u2019t be easy, but the team is working really hard on it, making very good progress and that would be a 100% renewable diesel capacity and over 10,000 barrels a day. Thanks for the question, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks, Mark, maybe a follow-up on some of your comments earlier, Pierre, where you mentioned, when you were talking about gas market and you mentioned the Eastern Med opportunities. You haven't talked about that much in a little while. In your conversations with potential buyers of that gas in the base, and I mean, in the past, when it was operated by Noble, it was -- there was a talk of everything between European targets to pipelines to Egypt, to floating LNG, and all sorts of opportunities. Any thoughts on what may look like it makes the most sense there in the Eastern Med and opportunities for whether it's shorter-term de - bottlenecking and an opportunity there versus longer-term project development? Pierre Breber : All options are still on the table, Ryan, and it's commercially sensitive, so I don't want to show our hand in any way. I mean, the point is that this is a great resource. There's some very low-cost expansions that can be done and there's some larger expansions that can be done over time. What's really changed is that was in a geography that a year ago looked oversupplied for natural gas and now looks much tighter. And so as you know, natural gas business internationally is really dependent on getting customers to sign up.  And I think customers are more motivated now and it's probably overdone as I said earlier, we expect the markets to correct, but it is a better time for us to be engaging. So it's a great resource in many cases is backing out coal, it has expansion opportunities and free cash flow positive from the moment that we closed Noble. So it's just a great asset and it's well-positioned now to have opportunities to grow in the future. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, everyone. Pierre, if I could start with you. Would it be possible to try and normalize your exposure to LNG given that there's so many moving parts over the course of the past year or so. I'm just noticing that you said during your comments that your spot exposure will be somewhat different in Q4 as a result of customers pulling long-term contracts. If we could just take the part of it and further normalize into 2022, 2023, where are your volumes and how much of that is going to be long -term versus spot? If you could have a go at that. Thanks. Pierre Breber : Paul we'll cover that more in our fourth-quarter call when we give full-year guidance on a number of items, we have a long-term contract that will begin next year, so it will take are waiting too long term contracts a little bit higher again, we've been notionally around 80%. But that's something -- that's why we very consciously just provided guidance for this quarter as it will change a little bit next year, but we'll do that on the fourth-quarter call. Paul Sankey : Okay. I'll move on to more. But if I could just slip a quick one of a few in regards to modeling, do I assume that we've put everything into buyback in terms of free cash flow, or are there any other items that you would highlight maybe pension with something that we should just be aware of going into 2022, and how much we consider your buyback to be? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Over time the vast majority of the excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividend and the buyback. We did a one-time pension supplement last quarter, it was really tied to the very low interest rates from a year ago. It sounds like a long time ago. But under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation rules, the funding requirement is fixed by on the year-end interest rates. And so we were a little bit underfunded and therefore, would have paid a little higher, that's called a variable interest rate essentially, higher than our cost of borrowing, and so that's why we supplemented it.  Obviously, we're in a much different place in terms of interest rates now, and you'd expect our pension contributions to be, has they have been. And we provide guidance on pension in our 10-Q filings. So I would not expect anything on that end. So, again, if you go to our financial priorities, Paul, you know them well. Sustain and grow the dividend. It's up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. Our capital guidance is going to be up, but it's no change from the guidance range and it's in a very tight guidance range and very capital efficient and lower where it was pre-COVID. We're going to pay down a little more debt. As I said, we're fast approaching a level where we can increase our buyback range. And so then, the balance is excess cash, and over time, it goes to shareholders. We're not going to sweep out each quarter because investors are very clear that they want us to maintain a buyback through the cycle. Paul Sankey : I guess that would mean no specials. Pierre Breber : I think it's time for you to ask the question to Mark. Paul Sankey : Mark. Thanks. Thanks, Pierre. Mark, very general question, but could you talk about how capacity is changing Downstream, both in refining and in chemicals? Because I know we're adding a lot of Chemicals. Obviously we are also shutting down a lot of Downstream house. Seriously, is there any way that the Chevron 's dramatically changing its capacity and exposure Downstream? And secondly, could you talk about that in the context of where you see U.S. in global capacity? I know this could take two hours, apologize, but if you could generally say how global capacity shifted, and the more numbers you could give us, the better. Thanks. Mark Nelson : Yeah, thanks, Paul. Let's start with the refining side of the business here. We've unused margin as the proxy for capacity being utilized here. We've said demand has to recover for high-value products. Inventory, we have to fall in the traditional ranges and then we need some degree of refinery rationalization, either closures or conversions throughout the system. If you're in the U.S. today, I think you're seeing much of that -- much of that demand recovery with Jet still to come and that's even with offices not completely open, and still some restrictions in place.  Inventory tending to find itself in traditional boundaries and starting to see some closures and/or conversions in some of our markets especially the U.S. West Coast, which means the market could be -- could actually be tight on things like motor gasoline, and even Jet 5 or 6 years from now. So you see that in the U.S.. If I shift to Asia, I would say that demand recovery on Jet is a little bit behind that of the U.S. especially given our exposure to Southeast Asia. Inventory reduction, falling into those ranges is starting to happen, some of that with China stopping some of its exports for the moment.  But demand catching up with refinery capacity in Asia is still needs to happen in that. That's means we both need some, perhaps some rationalization as well as demand just to catch up with the capacity that's there. And so my high-level comment would be that in the U.S., we're seeing the actions to bring refinery margins into balance over time getting closer to historic ranges in just a half phase behind that maybe, in Asia. And then for the petchem side of the equation, petchem margins have had a strong run this year on the back of good demand and considerable supply disruptions.  We would expect to see margins come off as we get to the fourth quarter normal seasonal type of drop-off. But we're actually preparing for -- with capacity growth over the next few years. We expect that to outpace demand, so we're at that part of the cycle. And even in 2025, we're presuming we'll be on the lower portion of the margin cycle. So that means that there will be a period of catch-up there in regard to demand catching capacity. Hope I got to your quiz. Paul Sankey : You did. Thanks, Mark. And just from a Chevron point of view, is there any major changes in your capacity over the next 5 years that you anticipate refining and chemicals? Thanks. Mark Nelson : Other than the comments we've made about -- you remember it was about a decade ago that we didn't match of our what I'll call rationalization, meaning taking things out of our portfolio. And we've highlighted energy transition spotlight that we have this opportunity for this very capital efficient conversion of individual hydroprocessing units. And we will certainly do that over the next decade to get to that 100,000 barrels a day of our DSAF (ph) capacity. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Paul. We're going to have to go to the next one. Paul Sankey : Bye. Mark Nelson : Thanks, Paul. Operator : We're going next to Rodger Reed with Wells Fargo. Rodger Reed : Thank you and good morning. Pierre, I'm going to hit you on capital returns, buybacks, and balance sheet. No I'm just kidding. Mark, I would like to ask you about the group oil-based three acquisition kind of how that fits in the overall structuring, and what we should think about there and whether or not we've seen some stories about renewable feed stock for Group 3, and maybe how you see that working in over time? Mark Nelson : Yes. Thanks, Roger. As mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're excited about the announced acquisition of Neste's Group III Base Oil Business and the Nexbase brand, and the reason for that is, it's a very capital efficient acquisition of both offtake of supply, appropriate qualifications, and the brand -- index-based brand itself. And what that does for us is it allows us to expand our offerings. So we're going to add that to our existing Group II, II+ and over Novvi offering to have a complete offering for the base oil needs for our customers in the future. And think about that Novvi brand that we've talked about, I think in the Energy transition spotlight, we shared that Walmart would be selling online our Havoline Pro-RS, the first renewable lubricant line.  And we've actually brought some of that forward. And starting next Monday, we will have our installer base in North America, specifically the U.S. and Canada, in particular, running a whole line of Havoline Pro-RS. So we're creating that demand for the renewable portion of that offering. And it really gives us something where we can be that supplier of the future for our base oil customers. Thanks for the question, Rodger. Rodger Reed : Yeah, absolutely. And then if we could come back to some of the things on the CapEx, you've referenced delays out of the Gulf of Mexico due to the storms, which totally makes sense. As you look at the development and some of the exploration, I think you're looking to do out there in the next couple of years, is there any change to that or any sort of change in the order of projects we should pay attention to? Pierre Breber : No, we have a steady stream of projects really with Anchor that has been underway. Whale that recently went to a final investment decision and Ballymore which is coming along. So you will see a very ratable development program. Gulf of Mexico is a high return, low carbon asset. Some of the lowest carbon intensity barrels in our portfolio in the single-digits. And is a business that we've been invested in for decades, have know-how, and competitive advantages and can find attractive investment opportunities.  So it's sort of a modestly growing part of the portfolio. Do you think of the biggest growth that we have going forward clearly is in the Permian, which I referred to earlier, Tengiz, a project that we're investing in, and it's project is going very well and the project will come on in a couple of years, but when you get to Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky's or Colorado, a few other places are also have very attractive investment opportunities that can deliver both higher returns and lower carbon. Rodger Reed : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 questions. The first 1 was, just thinking about the Balance Sheet, because of your conservatism on the way you manage your Balance Sheet, you've been able to make some counter-cyclical moves and Noble was obviously the most recent one. Given we're at the high part of the cycle now, could you talk about any plans to accelerate asset sales? I know it's not needed for the Balance Sheet, but it's interesting to hear whether you can -- there any opportunities out there. And if so, although they are across Upstream, Downstream, or Chemicals?  And then the second question is on Tengiz, it's good to see that the dividend come through after a number of years, are any loan repayments due in 2022? And then finally, just a quick comment and say thanks for the PCI calculation tool which you published. It's actually quite difficult to dig into some of those figures and understand all the variances. So I appreciate the transparency there. Pierre Breber : Well, thank you Biraj for recognizing PCI. Our teams will be very happy to hear that. We wanted to make a tool that was transparent where you could use it for other companies because I know comparability is of interest to investors and so it's based on, again, transparent reporting data and comparability and so thank you for taking advantage of that and I encourage others to check it out. Let me just talk about TCO because as we look back, we had a very successful spring and summer campaign there. We hit our productivity targets and we achieved a lot of our milestones, and we had a full workforce. So we had a Delta variant wave which caused some higher levels of isolation in the middle of the third quarter.  But we ended the quarter with positive rates very very low and we're back to our full workforce. And as I mentioned earlier, we intend to maintain a peak manpower workforce level through the winter months. We have a vaccination rate over 85% for that workforce so we're well-positioned to make a lot of progress this winter. Now, we have to be thoughtful about it because it can get cold there. So we're sequencing the work in a way that we're saving a work that can be done indoors or in sheltered locations during the coldest month of the winter. So no change clearly in the guidance that we provided on second quarter in terms of budget and schedule, but I wanted to give an update. Things are going very well in Tengiz and we're looking forward to a very productive winter season there. In terms of the dividend, you're right. It's the first dividend in 3 years, so that's nice to see. We did have a modest loan repay back that occurred last quarter. And look, we'll give guidance on 2022, just like with Paul's question, when we look forward. It will depend clearly also on oil prices, but that's something that will give guidance on our 4Q call. In terms of asset sales, yes, we acquired Noble when -- or announced the acquisition, when Brent was in the low 40s, and now Brent is in the low eighties.  And so, it's a commodity business, it has cycles, ups and downs, and when you buy or sell assets, timing makes a difference where you are in the cycle. And of course, strategic fit and all the elements were very, very pleased with the Noble transaction. We talked about, the timing of it, the first to do it, the synergies that we doubled, and the tax benefits that we saw this quarter and interest cost savings. So we did tender a number of bond offerings earlier this month. A lot of those bonds are Noble bonds, again, that was not included in our synergies because we weren't quite sure we can achieve that.  And we'll save over a $100 million in interest cost savings. So the Noble just keeps contributing to the Company, and that's part of the reason why we're a better Company now than we were several years ago. But it's a different market, so yeah, I view it more as a seller's market than a buyer's market right now. And so you're seeing us modestly increase some assets that don't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. In fact one of them is our position in the Eagle Ford. So that was a Noble legacy position, Chevron legacy was not in it. So we don't have quite the scale that we would like.  But again, essentially buying that position at $40, and now we have it on the market that's in the public domain. And obviously we expect to get much higher value than for what was implied in the purchase price. We have some other U.S. onshore assets that are on the market, again, that we feel are very attractive to a lot of industry players, but just won't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. Thanks, Biraj. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys, good morning. 2 questions. Mark Nelson : Morning. Pierre Breber : Morning to you, sir. Paul Cheng : The first one is for Mark. Mark, you guys, tipped the Pasadena Refinery and that the time you are saying that it's one-off, because you complement your Pascagoula Refinery. There's a lot -- quite a lot of refineries that's available for sale in here. So I want to see with the substantial amount of the refining capacity being shot, does it change the way that how you are looking at that business or that you think you already have sufficient of the capacity and supplementary, and you really don't need to add? And also the end of retail marketing, some of your peers that have been aggressively that building up and including in the US. And you guys have a walk that business for more than 10 years. And is there any trend to going back, so that on the energy transition, including in the EV charger and all that? The second question is for Pierre. You talked about say the TCO dividend, how about Angola LNG, can you give us some idea that if the current commodity price fall? So we assume every year that both Angola LNG and the TCO is going to pay the dividend. And any cost sensitivity you can provide that you have to change in the oil price, how the impact on that dividend payout going to look like? Mark Nelson : Alright, Paul, thank you for the questions. I'll take them, again, in reverse order. I think your second question was really about retail marketing. And as you know, we have 3 world-class brands, and we've taken a capital light approach to selling our branded fuels. In fact, 1 of the metrics that we often look at is the Opus brand power rating and we continue to be well at the top of that list. And what that means is the majority of our retail sites around the world that you would see are owned by retailers who has specifically chosen our brand. And so we have our brand, our fuel and generally not our capital.  We also happen to have one of the strongest retail convenience franchising offerings out there, extra mile that you've probably seen. In fact, I think we hit our 1,000th site, this year, with very very little attrition. And so we believe that our limited capital approach provides us the majority of the margin and sustainably delivered high returns, and still allows us to stay connected with customers. And as part of that offering to customers today, we have -- excuse me, EV charging stations in 7 countries around the world, and we're partnering with our retailers to continue to expand that offering as customers actually need it. Your second question was, I think about the refinery portfolio in general and maybe Pasadena specifically. We're very pleased with our refining portfolio today. And it's really because of that hydroprocessing capacity that we have across our system. It gives us flexibility to deal with the fuels of the future and renewable fuels in particular, in a very, very capital efficient way, specific to Pasadena. Again, we have an opportunity there. The premise of the acquisition continues to hold for us in processing our equity crude, being able to supply our own service stations in the Texas-Louisiana area. And then of course, having the intermediate back and forth between Pascagoula and Pasadena.  That's all working as we would expect. And we've shared that we think there's an opportunity there to have very efficient expansion of light tight oil processing capacity, and we've hinted that that's going to be a hydro-skimming focus. We're working on that real hard and look forward to talking more about that next year. Thanks for your question, Paul. Now Pierre. Pierre Breber : Yeah and on Angola LNG, so it's -- in our looking ahead flight Paul, we guide towards $300 million of return of capital. It's essentially a dividend, it just kind of an accounting characterization as it has returned to capital. It's cash, is the bottom align. And in terms of guidance going forward, and let me just say Angola LNG does sell into the spot market essentially both on oil link strips, and into Europe, TTF or international JKM markets. So it does have exposure, exposure to international natural gas pricing. 300 million will be a nice return on capital here in the fourth quarter.  And again, just like with Paul Sankey's question, we'll provide guidance for our full LNG portfolio on the fourth-quarter call for 2022. That will include Australia, Angola LNG, and our interest in Equatorial Guinea, which is again, it's another asset that was acquired through Noble Energy. Thanks, Paul. Operator : We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : Hey, guys 2 questions. I'll ask them upfront. The first one is, I'd like to pick your brain on the mid-cycle chemical margins here. Historically we thought the mid-cycle would be more like $0.25, obviously right now we're more like 65. And even though you did say no, the margins will decline, some of the bigger chemical ethylene players that are out there saying, \"We will settle for the next 2, 3 years above the mid-cycle levels. \" So while the mid-cycle could be 25, you could still see 35 to 40. So that's the first question, and the second question is you seem -- you get into the CNG distribution for the first time. And I'm wondering if this is associated with the strategy of developing RNG and basically controlling the entire value chain so you can distribute your RNG that you're pretty -- going to produce through your distribution network. Mark Nelson : Thanks, Manav got your question. So first on petrochemical margins, we indicated as we look to the longest of terms we expect pet-chem demand to continue to grow in line with the long-term GDP growth. We believe, in the next 4 to 5 years, we do see capacity growth in the next couple of years going past demand. Which brings us to towards the bottom portion of the margin cycle. And so I think we shared in our Investor Day discussions last year that we brought our view down and it's -- and again erring on the side of conservative and, perhaps, but that it was going to be $0.20 per pound in regards to where we could expect those margins over time, and anything above that, of course, we will take it. And it drives us in our CPChem joint venture to make sure that we continue to work on our unit cost reductions, which they have done a very good job on and will continue to do going forward. And so we see that that is our number looking forward. And then I want to get to your comment on the R&G portfolio. You read it exactly correctly. Our close on the 60 American natural gas sites is really about us leveraging our strength. When we talked about renewable natural gas, we say a couple of things. We say it leverages our strengths and bio feedstocks are really important to strength in particular, our value chain activation, and partnerships.  And the 2 areas where you can see this at play, actually in the formal presentation, would be in the gas that's now coming from CalBio from all of the farms that we have there. And then our Brightmark activity experiencing their first delivered gas on the 60 CNG sites that -- American natural gas CNG sites with [Indiscernible], that allows us to follow the request of our customers, if you will. And we're trying to get the CNG to those customers throughout the -- our portfolio. And that's the first step in doing it in a platform for us to grow. Manav Gupta : Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Manav. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. I may have missed it but, can you just discuss the drivers of why TCO is declaring this dividend now? And what we should look to assess if they will declare it next year, and just some background on how we could calculate that? And then my second question, just on cost inflation. What you're seeing across your projects, if it's impacting TCO at all, or any of your either large -- sorry, long-cycle projects or short-cycle in the Permian? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jason. Yes. I should have mentioned, now TCO is paying a dividend. It was in the plan, but it could be higher than was planned, which is why we've guided to a range. Primarily because two things, one, clearly the macro-environment is stronger, so it is -- produces a light oil that attracts trades to a tight discount to brand and, with the fiscal terms and the rest of it, it's generating excess cash. And also we've seen at the project some real cost savings. Again, we've seen some deferrals, but that would be factored into retaining cash in TCO. But we've seen some underlying greater inefficient -- efficiencies and we've seen some foreign exchange benefits there.  So it's a function of it, things going well both from a market environment and from an execution of the project. Again, in terms of 2022, we will provide guidance on the fourth-quarter call like we have in prior years, we've guided historically to that cash flow line, which is the difference between dividends and affiliate earnings, I think we also might just give separately a range on expected dividends from Tengiz and other major affiliates. And then, in terms of cost, we're not really seeing any cost increases. Rigs -- U.S. onshore rigs are maybe creeping up, but they're still well below where they were pre-COVID and in general, the industry is operating below capacity.  So although there are pockets of goods and services that we use that are tied to the general economy, like steel and clearly steel is up. But the majority of our costs are tied to industry-specific major equipment, and that's still operating below capacity, so it could increase in the future, I know there's a lot of talk about it, but what we're seeing up-to-date is costs are well under control. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. Roderick Green : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call, please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Jen. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I will turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Thanks, Roderick. After the challenges of 2020, we began last year clear eyed about the economic realities we faced, and at the same time, optimistic about an eventual recovery. By the end of 2021, we had one of our most successful years ever, with return on capital employed approaching 10%, our highest since 2014; the successful integration of Noble Energy, while more than doubling initial synergy estimates; and record free cash flow, 25% greater than our previous high. 2021 was also the year when Chevron accelerated our efforts to advance a lower-carbon future by forming Chevron New Energies, an organization that aims to grow businesses in hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets, introducing a 2050 net-zero aspiration for upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions and establishing a portfolio carbon intensity target that includes Scope 3 emissions and more than tripling our planned lower carbon investments. Chevron is an even better company today than we were just a few years ago. We're showing it through our actions and our performance, which we expect to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And we intend to keep getting better. Our record free cash flow enabled us to strongly address all 4 of our financial priorities in 2021, a higher dividend for the 34th consecutive year, a disciplined capital program, well below budget, significant debt paydown with a year-end net debt ratio comfortably below 20% and another year of share buybacks, our 14th out of the past 18 years. I expect 2022 will be even better for cash returns to shareholders with another dividend increase announced this week and first quarter buybacks projected at the top of our guidance range. We're optimistic about the future, focused on continuing to reward our shareholders while investing to grow our businesses and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We made the most of this challenging period, transforming Chevron through a well-timed acquisition and an enterprise-wide restructuring into a leaner and more productive company. In just 2 years, CapEx was reduced by almost half from Chevron and Noble's pre-COVID total. And operating expenses for the combined company in 2021 were lower than for Chevron on a standalone basis in 2019. The Noble acquisition and increasing capital efficiency enabled us to maintain a 5-year reserve replacement ratio above 100%. And 2021 was very consistent with that longer-term performance, driven primarily by additions in the Permian, Gulf of Mexico and Australia and partly offset by lower reserves in Kazakhstan, mostly due to higher prices and their negative effect on our share of reserves. For more on our strong financial performance, over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $5.1 billion or $2.63 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.56 per share. The quarter's results included 3 special items : asset sale gains of $520 million, primarily on sales of mature conventional assets in the U.S.; losses on the early retirement of debt of $260 million, which will result in significant future interest cost savings; and pension settlement costs of $82 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Full year earnings were over $15 billion, the highest since 2014. Compared with 3Q, adjusted 4Q earnings were down $770 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were flat, with higher realizations offset primarily by negative LNG trading timing effects and higher DD&A. DD&A increased on catch-up depreciation for our interest in North West Shelf, which no longer meets asset held-for-sale criteria and impairments of certain late life assets triggered by updated abandonment estimates. Other items include additional taxes and royalties related to higher prices under certain international contracts. Adjusted downstream earnings were down with lower chemicals margins and volumes at CPChem and GS Caltex in addition to year-end inventory charges. The All Other segment declined due to tax charges. Across all segments, operating expenses increased in part due to higher accruals for employee bonuses and stock-based compensation. Adjusted earnings increased over $15 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased realizations in upstream as well as improved refining and chemicals margins. Costs were up primarily on the acquisition of Noble Energy that closed in 4Q 2020, higher fuel costs and an unfavorable swing in accruals for employee benefits. 2022 production is expected to be flat to down 3% due to expiration of contracts in Indonesia and Thailand. These contracts are not being extended as we were unable to do so in terms competitive with our alternatives. Excluding contract expirations and 2022 asset sales, we expect a 2% to 5% increase in production led by the Permian and lower turnaround activity in TCO in Australia. We reaffirm our prior long-term guidance of a 3% production CAGR through 2025, and we'll share more about our long-term outlook at our upcoming Investor Day. I'll call out a few items on Slide 11. Full year guidance for the All Other segment excludes special items such as pension settlement costs. The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Affiliate dividends are expected to be between $2 billion and $3 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. We do not expect any additional lending or loan repayments this year at TCO. Finally, asset sale proceeds are expected to be in line with historical averages. We've updated our price sensitivities to include natural gas. Also, our guidance for both earnings and cash flow sensitivities is now the same as we're likely to consume the remainder of our NOLs and other favorable tax attributes if prices remain higher. Finally, we did not receive our federal income tax refund last quarter and expect it later this year. Back to Mike. Michael Wirth : All right. Thanks, Pierre. I believe 2021 was a pivotal year for Chevron, where we got better in so many ways. And we look forward to 2022 and beyond, confident in our strategy and capabilities that aim to deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day on March 1. At this time, we expect to be at the New York Stock Exchange with a limited number of participants. The meeting will be webcast for all to see. With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick. Roderick Green : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all questions answered. Jen, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question I had was more of a housekeeping item for you, Pierre, which is, in the quarter, it looked like LNG timing effects had a meaningful drag here. I recognize there was a lot of volatility, particularly towards the end of the month with TPS and JKM, but maybe you can break it down in layman's terms for us. What does that really mean and what happened in the quarter? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Neil. About half of the timing effects in the quarter and first, we're showing a swing between 3Q and 4Q. We had a gain in the third quarter and a negative variance -- a negative absolute amount and a negative swing in fourth quarter. About half of the effects in the quarter were due to a negative inventory charge. So we had 2 cargoes on the water at year-end. They get valued into inventory at average annual prices, which were well below the purchase price because as you said, Neil, prices -- this was a rising price environment and prices rose in the end of the quarter. So that will reverse itself next year when those are -- or this year when they're sold at the higher prices that they purchased at. And then the balance of the timing effects are in paper mark-to-market effects. And as you know, the fit the paper, which is tied to physical cargoes gets marked to market where the physical cargoes are not. And so that creates a timing effect, which unwinds when the physical cargoes are delivered. We ended the year with a positive mark-to-market, but not as positive as what we had at the end of the third quarter. We added some JKM shorts during the quarter to balance our portfolio. We're still net long JKM. So any effects going forward will depend on the direction of future prices. And all this activity is really just geared towards managing our overall price exposure between our sales agreements and our supplies, which are a mix of both Brent and JKM prices. And just to put a fine point on the comment you made, these positions are not very large. But when we have natural gas LNG price movements that have gone from $10 to $20 to $30 an Mcf, it's causing larger timing effects than you would normally see. Neil Mehta : That makes a lot of sense, Pierre. And then the follow-up for you is just on cash flow. Again, relative to consensus, it was softer. It does seem like there's some onetimers in there, maybe something around the timing of tax refunds and then where Angola shows up, but there's still a gap in there. So can you just talk about how you bridge to Street numbers in your mind, anything we need to carry forward as we think about next year? Pierre Breber : Well, I'll cover the 2 points you made. We -- and I mentioned that we did not receive the IRS tax refund that we expected in the fourth quarter, we expect it sometime this year. We did receive a TCO dividend. There is a 15% withholding tax that comes off of the dividend. And we did receive the Angola LNG return of capital. It actually exceeded our guidance. By the way, the TCO dividend was at the high end of our guidance range. And the return of capital from Angola was above our guidance. But again, it shows up in cash from investing and not cash from ops because it's a return of capital. If you look beyond that, we do have, and as I referred to in our prepared remarks, we have certain contracts internationally that have additional taxes and royalties that kick in essentially when oil and LNG prices are higher, and we don't share specifics on our contracts. But as we talked about, we had extraordinarily high LNG pricing of $30, and then we also had oil prices that increase during the year. And then the last thing I'd say is we provided guidance on the third quarter call on our expected increase in earnings from LNG spot cargoes. And we gave that guidance in part because LNG prices increased significantly. And we said we expected to have fewer cargoes because our long-term contract takes were going to be higher during the winter from our primarily Japanese customers. We did not operate -- we didn't produce as much out of Australia, so we had fewer LNG spot cargoes. And again, that was an opportunity missed and that resulted in lower earnings and cash flow. Michael Wirth : Neil, it's Mike. The one other thing you talked about what should you bear in mind going forward? As we've been in this fairly depressed commodity price environment, we've built up net operating losses in our business. And as we've returned to profitability, those have now been utilized and offset against taxes payable. As we work our way through those and in a strong price environment that could happen sooner rather than later, we'll be in a net taxable position that's quite different than what we were before as well. And so I think that's another point that may not be as evident in the quarter. But as you go forward, it's kind of a good news/bad news thing, I suppose, we're going to be more profitable, but it also means now we're going to have higher taxes payable. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : My first question is on the 2022 production outlook. Obviously, you had an extremely strong Permian production in the fourth quarter. It's about 70,000 barrels a day -- or 80,000 barrels a day, I'm sorry, above the full year average, and you're guiding to 80,000 barrels a day of new production in '22 over '21. So it seems like you can just get there from the Permian alone. But I'm just curious, are there other moving pieces that you should be thinking about on the new production element of the growth for '22? Or is there some conservatism there? Any thoughts would be helpful. Michael Wirth : Yes, Phil, fourth quarter Permian does look strong. And one thing that we do see from time to time is with our non-operated joint venture position, sometimes the way production gets reported in by partners can result in a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers. But broadly speaking, the Permian is healthy and getting better. I think 2022 Permian production will be a little bit better than we showed at our Investor Day last March. And roughly speaking, up around maybe 10% compared to full year average in 2021. And that is the largest piece of what we would anticipate in terms of production growth next year. There is some growth in base and other primarily. As Pierre said in his comments, we've got lower planned turnaround activity at TCO, and we expect some more uptime at Gorgon. And then that's offset by a few asset sales that we would anticipate. So those are the significant moving pieces in production for 2022. Philip Gresh : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And Mike, I know you'll get in a lot more detail in March at the Analyst Day and looking forward to that. But just kind of looking back pre-COVID at prior analyst days, your framework was 60 Brent that you're using to balance CapEx and distributions in a fairly evenly balanced framework. Obviously, oil is at 90 now and maybe you don't want to give a guidance at those types of levels. But I am curious how you're thinking about what is the right way to look at the cash balancing framework? What price would you think is reasonable these days? As I know you like to manage the business through the cycle, not based on spot prices. Michael Wirth : Yes. We will talk about that more in March, Phil. But our longer-term view on the pricing environment hasn't changed a lot. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced economically at prices lower than what we see today. And our breakeven reflects that. And so we are in a period of time here where cash flow is strong. As we mentioned in our comments, the last 2 quarters have been the best 2 quarters the company has ever seen. And last year was 25% higher than the best year in our history. So we increased the dividend. Debt came down significantly, and we've guided to the high end of our share repurchase range. If we continue to see an environment like this, the balance sheet doesn't need to be a lot stronger than it is today. And we've already increased the dividend and we're going to be disciplined on capital. And so that really leaves one lever left. And I think over time, we're going to -- you should expect us to be consistent with our history, which is returning cash through share repurchases. And at least in an environment like this, we've got ample cash to do that and sustain that well into any kind of a correction that we eventually will see. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question is on TCO. I guess now that you're through much of the winter campaign, is there any update on how FGP-WPMP and how those are tracking on cost and schedule maybe given your COVID protocols and efficiencies? And if you have any color on impact related to the recent geopolitical unrest, that would also be very helpful. Michael Wirth - CEO: Sure, Jeanine. Fourth quarter was really good execution on field productivity. We made terrific progress and that's carried forward as we began the year. We did have some impact during the unrest that occurred in Kazakhstan, but for about a week is the amount of time that it really cost us in the field there. We've remobilized everyone now and are back at full strength in terms of field activity. And we've got a highly vaccinated workforce, more than 90%. One of the highest rates of vaccination anywhere in our system in the world. And while we have seen Omicron cases appear in the workforce there, at this point, it's at a level that's very well managed, and it's not having any impact on field construction and activity. So we are continuing to make good progress. We have not made any change to our cost or schedule guidance and are overall at about 89% project progress and 82% construction progress at this point. So things have been managed really well on the ground by our team during a pretty challenging month of January. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Good to hear. Our follow-up question or second question, maybe following up on Phil's question on the Permian. It's -- you guys had a really strong quarter, at least also compared to our expectations. You mentioned that 2022 production is a little better than where you thought it was going to be from your March Analyst Day forecast. So just can you clarify, have you accelerated activity there? Or is it really just all based on better efficiencies? And I guess given its importance to corporate growth in the medium term, are you taking any steps related to supplies or labor or equipment in anticipation of some tightening in the service markets over the next couple of years? Michael Wirth : Yes. So let me speak first to activity. And then I'm going to let Pierre, who's now in charge of our supply chain organization, by the way, speak to any signs of inflation and how we're managing that. Activity in the Permian is really increasing aligned with the guidance that we've issued previously and spending this year up from $2 billion to $3 billion. Wells put on production, a little bit over 200 we anticipate this year, which is up about 50% versus 2021. And we'll share an update on all of these things when we see you in March. So I would say this is really very well aligned with what we've already guided to and indicated and reflects the ongoing efficiencies that we continue to see in the field and just the quality of this asset, which endures as we go through cycles like the one we just went through. It's really quite nice to have an asset in your portfolio that is this large, that's this flexible when it comes to capital and that we can demobilize, remobilize, not that we would intend to do this frequently, but when conditions call for it, we've been able to exercise that flexibility here over the last couple of years. So strong progress there. And I'll let Pierre comment on input costs. Pierre Breber : Jeanine, we continue to manage our costs, we think, very well in the Permian and across our portfolio. Our capital budget, which we announced in December, expected some COGS increase, modest in the low single digits. And what we might be seeing a little bit more than that in the Permian, it's very manageable and we think we can offset it with efficiencies. So as we've talked about, although rates are up, they're still below where they were pre-COVID on rigs capacity in the industry for specific oil and gas, equipment and services is still below pre-COVID levels. So whereas we are exposed to labor and steel and certain other elements, cost elements that are tied to the broad-based economy, oil and gas-specific equipment services are still well under control and our ability to contract well, be a very good partner to work with, all gives us confidence that the little bit of cost pressure we're seeing is very manageable within the range of what we expected, and we intend to deliver our capital program in line with our budget. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : So Pierre, I think your explanation about the dividend from TCO being a return of capital, I think that probably explains why The Street's cash flow numbers were too high. But my question is really about the go-forward portfolio leverage. So you obviously lose Indonesia, you lose Thailand, which I guess was gas. But you've got the Permian driving growth on a lighter recent history of PSC capital for the cost call standpoint. So my question is when I think about portfolio oil leverage for the go-forward outlook, how does that compare to the legacy portfolio given all those changes? Pierre Breber : Our guidance on -- let me start by saying we've always been the most levered among the integrated energy companies. That's a function of the portfolio we've created over a long time, which tends to be upstream-weighted. And within upstream, we tend to be oil-weighted. And again, a big portion of our LNG is sold under oil prices. So whereas we were viewed as a defensive stock during some of the challenging times in 2020 and last year because of how we manage the balance sheet and how we're able to flex our capital program and manage our costs, we really are more of an oil play and we're much more levered on the upside. And we've shown that in last Investor Day, and we'll show that again in the upcoming Investor Day. In terms of our sensitivity, I mean, it's still around the same when you factor it all in. I mean, Indonesia was working its way to be a fairly modest portion of the portfolio. You are right over time with both Tengiz and the Permian that increases are weighting in some ways. But the guidance that we provided of $400 million of earnings and cash flow benefit from a dollar change in prices still holds. Douglas Leggate : My follow-up, if I may, is to go back to your one-off comments, the DD&A and the -- I guess, the timing effects. I'm just going to ask that the question for a little clarity. On the DD&A, it looks like there was some catch-up. What is -- how much was that because you didn't strip it out? I'm curious why you didn't strip it out. And then just real quick on the LNG, was there a shift in contract versus spot volume exposure that also impacted the quarter? And then that's it for me. Pierre Breber : Yes, Doug. And first, just on your first question, so the return of capital was Angola LNG. TCO was a dividend withholding tax. But you're right, that part of that does not show up in cash from ops. In terms of DD&A, about half is due to the catch-up at North West Shelf. So we designated that asset as held for sale about 18 months ago. So you're capturing 18 months of depreciation all in the fourth quarter. We don't call the special item because obviously, it would have been in our underlying results if we -- it had been held for use during that time. And the other half are impairments that are tied to increases in abandonment estimates for late in life assets. So because these estimates, which is part of our regular updating process because these assets are very late in life, they don't have the production -- remaining production life or time to recover those additional abandonment estimates and therefore, that results in an impairment. So about half is the catch up and the half -- and those are both, I would call them onetime in nature. And in terms of the LNG, yes, there was a shift in fourth quarter to more contractless spot. We guided to that on the third quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it was even more so. So in the winter months, our Northern Hemisphere customers tend to increase their takes under the long-term contracts. And then we didn't produce as reliably in the fourth quarter, so we had fewer spot cargoes. So what you're seeing, we did not benefit as much with the run-up in spot prices as we had guided to in the third quarter, and our weighting was more oil contract-related. Now those contracts are doing very well. Spot market goes up and down. But you'll see more exposure as we go forward. Douglas Leggate : Pierre, just I guess the point was the headline miss wasn't as bad as it looks. So thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So the first one I wanted to ask on is just CapEx. I think it's notable that you all came in for last year below the bottom end of your CapEx guide. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the drivers of that CapEx beat. And then, Pierre, you mentioned before, I think, that you're seeing or assumed a few percentage points of inflation in the Permian. I was wondering if you could just broaden that out and talk about the inflationary trends you're seeing across the global portfolio and opportunities to potentially offset that as you think about 2022 spending levels? Pierre Breber : So yes, sorry, the low single digits was really meant to be across the portfolio. And that's factored into our $15.3 billion capital program. But obviously, if you look offshore, those rig rates have stayed flat to down. And we do contract where we lock in rates for some services. We have price caps on some services. There's lots of ways that we work to mitigate our exposure to COGS. But -- so I would view it as low single-digits overall. Permian, perhaps a little bit higher, not nearly as high as numbers that I'm hearing from some others. We don't see anything in our cost that would be double digits at all. So a little bit very modest, presented to higher than what we had currently -- we had planned for and again, very manageable within -- by offsetting with efficiencies. Michael Wirth : And on 2021, Devin, there's nothing noteworthy in the profile of CapEx and what it was that drove the ultimate outcome, which was a little below what we had guided to. There's a lot of inertia in some of these things and as we pulled the hand break pretty hard in 2020, we throttled a lot of things down. And as we start to bottom out and turn that back around a little bit as we will in 2022, this system just needs to adjust to that. And so I wouldn't call it anything there that's unique or especially noteworthy. Pierre Breber : We have had, still, about half of the underspend is due to project deferrals like at Tengiz due to COVID and other impact and about half is capital -- greater capital efficiency and other cost savings. Devin McDermott : Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, I wanted to ask on Australia LNG and Gorgon specifically. I was wondering if you could talk in a bit more detail around some of the recent downtime there. What happened and then what steps are being taken to ensure better uptime here in 2022? Michael Wirth : Yes, I'll take that, Devin. Look, it's a point of frustration, no doubt. During normal rounds, we had an operator that spotted evidence that we had the risk of an operating issue at one of the units in the dehydration train. Nothing that was catastrophic or alarming but a sharp-eyed operator picked up evidence is something that as we investigated further, we felt it was prudent to take a quick pit stop to address this. And so that's been completed at 2 of the 3 trains, and they're all same design. So these things tend to show up across all 3 trains. . The third train is undergoing that pit stop right now and is also addressing a problem with one of the compressors that was identified, and this was an opportune time to make a couple of changes with that in order to reduce risk going forward. So we should -- we expect to operate reliably. We've done our first major turnaround on all 3 trains now, those are behind us at Gorgon. We do not have any planned turnarounds in 2022. And as we complete this last pit stop that's underway, our expectation is that we're going to have strong operational performance this year and see more production out of Gorgon than we did in '21. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Guys, on your guidance, the volumes will fall this year, would you characterize that as you\u2019re using a conservative oil price assumption and being determined not to raise CapEx? Or were there other issues around the concessions, particularly? And as a follow-up, could you accelerate the Permian, if you wanted to? Or can you talk about inflationary pressures that you might be seeing in the Permian as a matter of labor, steel, et cetera, et cetera? Michael Wirth : Okay. Yes, on production guidance, Paul, I would hope this isn't big news to people. I mean it's -- we've long been public about the fact that we couldn't extend the concessions in Indonesia and Thailand on terms that would compete with other opportunities within our portfolio. And so this has been out in the public domain for quite some time. And so when you pull those out, we're at 2% to 5% and Pierre reiterated the compound annual growth of 3% out through 2025. And so this is very consistent with the guidance and the messaging that we've been trying to communicate for quite some time. On the question of, could you accelerate the Permian? In theory, the answer to that 5 years ago was yes. The answer to that today is yes. We've been very focused on execution, efficiency and returns. And as I said, we laid out in March of last year a profile that showed strong production growth, long plateau, strong returns and capital efficiency. We'll update that again here in the new year, but at March. But this is an asset that just continues to look as good as we've portrayed it to you, and we're not going to get out ahead of ourselves chasing anything as we bring activity back up from $2 billion last year to $3 billion. That's a 50% increase in capital spend. I mentioned that we're going to see a 50% increase in wells put on production in '22 versus '21. That is a meaningful step up in activity, and we want to execute that well. And so I don't think we're going to be tempted by the price of the day to put that at risk by doing more. And I think Pierre already addressed inflation. I don't know, Pierre, if there's anything else you'd like to say on either of those topics. Pierre Breber : No. Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : My quick question is your U.S. downstream results were down about $400 million quarter-over-quarter and we expected about $200 million of that to be chemicals headwind. But we also saw somewhere so what peers are doing is that refining was able to jump up and make up for it. In this case, it looks like both went down a little. And if you could help us understand what the maintenance in the refining system, what went on in U.S. refining because of which refining was also down quarter-over-quarter? Pierre Breber : Manav, the -- there were a number of items we referred to, including year-end inventory effects. But the higher employee benefit costs really crosses all segments that would include U.S. downstream. So we had a very strong year. We expect higher employee bonuses and we accrued for that. And our stock ran up in the fourth quarter, and it's continued actually in the first quarter. And we have to do accrual for stock-based compensation that's tied to both the absolute stock price movement and the relative stock price movement because of how some of our incentive programs work. So that's in the segment, and I think that helps explain part of your question. Manav Gupta : And a quick follow-up is you have a global footprint. Help us understand within your entire system, how you're tracking refined product demand, gasoline, diesel, jet as well, anything you could help us understand where we are versus before the pandemic started. Michael Wirth : Yes. Manav, it's -- I think a lot of the data you see in the public domain is pretty good. We've got gasoline demand globally up higher than it was pre pandemic. Diesel at and perhaps slightly above, jet fuel continues to lag. The specific numbers can vary a little bit region by region. But broadly speaking, that's where we are. The ground transport fuels are at or above pre-COVID levels. Aviation is not and we still have an economic recovery underway. And we still have a lot of people working from home. We have people that aren't traveling for business and not taking international flights. And so even with the robust demand recovery that we've seen, there is still another lag to the demand improvement that is likely to occur here in 2022. And so I think the demand outlook is solid. And the issues, frankly, have been a little bit more on the supply side than the demand side. Operator : Next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : So I have 2 questions, please. My -- if we're looking at your, I think, well-spoken slogans, lower carbon and higher return in here that Permian definitely is going to contribute to the higher return. Outside Permian, can you help us that to maybe bridge the gap or that you indicate what are the self-help that you guys will drive so that we could see a better return over the next perhaps 1 or 2 years? And the second question is, I want to go back into the Australian LNG as you indicated, I think, has been a source of frustration to management, as well to many people. And it seems like every -- I mean, the plan has only been on stream since 2016, 2015. And so really not that old, but we have all this kind of tiny little problem from different units coming up and niche one every time that they did, same story is all -- everyone there has problem. All the 3 train a problem because they're all under the same design or same manufacturer. So have you guys go into and do a thorough review on all the units and trying to see whether that has other potential time band that we need to face? Michael Wirth : Yes. Paul, let me make a quick comment on the returns drivers, and I might ask Pierre to build on it and then I'll come back to LNG. Look, on returns, yes, Permian is highly accretive to returns because we get very, very strong returns out of the Permian, it's short cycle, and we're putting a fair amount of capital into it. We are reducing costs across our business. And as I indicated, we're running Chevron and Noble together today for costs that are lower than Chevron was stand-alone in 2019. So that is an improved -- significant driver of improved returns. We're working across the value chain to capture more margin. That's both in the downstream and in the upstream, a lot of self-help initiatives in the downstream. And so there are -- rather than think about pointing to assets, I would talk to you about the way we work and finding ways to improve efficiency and productivity across all of our operations is what are driving the improvement. And it's really rolling up your sleeves and doing this the old-fashioned way. And it's a lot of little things that you stay very focused on. Pierre, I don't know if you want to add anything else on drivers of return improvement. Pierre Breber : We'll share more at the upcoming Investor Day, and we've showed it the last couple of investor days, right, what Mike talked about, it's constant margin, we obviously doubled; Noble synergies, we transformed the whole enterprise and reduced costs, working across the value chain and optimizing. As Mike said and Mark Nelson and the downstream has showed some ambitious self-help. And then capital efficiency, both where we're putting new capital and higher returns across the portfolio, and of course, as a lower return prior capital depreciates off. So we'll update you and everyone at our next Investor Day, but that's the playbook that we've been using, and we'll continue to use going forward. Michael Wirth : Paul, to your question about Gorgon, you're right. It's not an old facility. And you're right, it has had more than its share of teething pains as we've been here in the first few years of operation. We have people all over this I mentioned earlier that it was a sharp-eyed operator on routine rounds that spotted something that we've addressed and that has averted the possibility of a more serious outage there. And we continue to do so. We don't have -- and a phrase you used, I won't repeat, but we don't have a big problem that's waiting to materialize that we've identified. And we have had strong teams of people from our upstream organization. We've brought people in from our downstream organization that have a lot of experience in these process facilities to work on reliability and mechanical integrity and address any of the things that -- frankly continue the things we've been fixing are things that reflect problems that -- the seeds we're sowing during the design and construction at a time when the industry was under a lot of pressure. And we've talked a lot about how we need to do better and our commitment to improve major capital project performance going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from and Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : A question on the Gulf of Mexico. First of all, any update on the progress of potential deepwater developments in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including an anchor, which builds down like of a sanction, which seems like a lifetime ago. And the courts just canceled the result of a recent lease wholesale in the Gulf of Mexico. Maybe comment on whether you see any potential for incremental headwinds there on the regulatory front that could impact things in the future. Michael Wirth : Yes. So a quick update on Anchor. We expect first oil in 2024, and that holds. The whole assembly is complete and commissioning is underway in Korea. We've begun drilling the first development well with a ship called the Deepwater Conqueror. It's a project that's got an attractive development costs, and that's even when you include some costs that are really onetime costs related to new technologies. Similarly, the Whale project, where we're not the operator, is targeted for first oil in 2024 and good progress there. And finally, Mad Dog 2, where we're also in a non-op position is expected to have first oil this year. So a number of projects that are making good progress and an important part of our portfolio. Lease sale 257, which was in the news. Yesterday, we were the apparent high bidder on a large number of blocks there that we found attractive. We're reviewing this judicial decision right now, and so I can't comment more about that. We're disappointed because these lease sales have been conducted successfully in the Gulf of Mexico for decades now and have resulted in us being one of the largest leaseholders out there with over 240 leases. It's a strong part of our base business. It contributes to energy security in this country. These are strong contributors to our portfolio and frankly, some of the lowest carbon intensity barrels that we produce. So we hope this is resolved in a manner that allows continued development and investment in the United States energy economy. Ryan Todd : All right. And maybe just an overall question on refining. I appreciate some of the comments you made a few minutes ago, but in general, it feels like global product markets have tightened up quite a bit with the outlook looking and pretty encouraging for 2022. How -- can you provide some thoughts about how you're thinking about the setup for refining this year? What looks encouraging and what are some of the potential risks that you see to the outlook? Michael Wirth : Yes. I mean I mentioned earlier the demand recovery, which is underway and which still has another leg to it. And we have seen margins strengthen across our portfolio as last year concluded. And so I think those are encouraging signs. Asia still has, I think, some risks. The approach taken by some countries, notably China, to how they've dealt with the pandemic may lead their economy to some risks if these variants continue to emerge. And then, of course, you have some other things in Asia. And again, in China, the situation within the real estate sector poses an uncertainty, I think, to some of the economic numbers there overall. So -- but broadly speaking, I think you're right, Ryan. We're seeing strengthening on the refining side, we're seeing utilization improve. And the chemical sector has continued to be strong, although it has been moderating from the highs early last year, still above mid-cycle as it's kind of trending back towards that. And so I think we're setting up for a stronger year in '22 than we saw in '21 across that sector. Operator : Our next question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : I just had one question, and it's a follow-up to the question you made on returns. And I'll just really make a simple high-level observation that 2021 cash flow [$31 billion] ex working capital is almost identical to what was delivered in 2018 and then almost identical oil price environment. But of course, the payout ratio has risen considerably over the last 3 years. And my question is really what does the Board think it's seeing gives us the confidence to raise that payout ratio so meaningfully? Michael Wirth : Yes. It's the capital efficiency is the big driver, Alastair. So you're right. The commodity price environments in those 2 years are pretty similar. Cash from ops, pretty similar, although there can be some moving parts in there that are not necessarily just commodity price. But we have capital spend that is significantly down from that period of time, which means free cash flow is significantly higher. And our belief going forward, our capital guidance going forward is $15 billion to $17 billion for the next 5 years. It has come down from $19 billion to $22 billion pre COVID. So that's a structural downshift. Our production guidance has not changed. And so what we have is a portfolio that is generating free cash flow and future cash flows in a much more capital-efficient manner which allows us to return more capital to shareholders. So that's a simple story. Operator : Our next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria, RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : It's actually just a follow-up on North West Shelf and that reclassification there. Could you just provide a bit more color on the rationale for that? Is that a change in your intentions there? And obviously, the last couple of years is not a great time to be selling assets. I'm just wondering if that was a function of you not getting the valuation this you desired or something else? Michael Wirth : Yes. Biraj, I think what we've said previously, we had an unsolicited offer on North West Shelf going back a period of time, which led us to an interesting conversation. And we want value -- we're not in a position where we need to sell assets to generate cash. But if an asset works better for somebody else and they see a different value equation that we do, that's certainly a conversation worth having. And so over the last period of time, we've been in a conversation like that. It ultimately has not led to a transaction. And so it's just changed the accounting classification for that asset. It's a good asset to generate strong cash flow. Obviously, we're in a market today where LNG demand is very high, and there's a lot of gas in Australia still to run through these plants. And so it's a nice part of our portfolio. Pierre Breber : Yes. Just to echo that, I view it more as accounting-related than anything else. There's a number of criteria that need to be met for asset held for sale, and there's just one part that no longer has met. And so that's why we did the catch-up depreciation. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. That's very clear. And then the second follow-up was on Tengiz. I think you previously mentioned the potential sort of loan repayments back to the parent. Do you have any guidance for 2022, given the current pricing environment? Pierre Breber : Our guidance is no loan repayment, but also no additional loans. The dividend is included in the overall affiliate dividend I will make a point, we changed our guidance from focusing on the cash flow line, which is affiliate income less dividends and just focus on the true cash part. If you look back to that line, which again is the difference between income and dividends from our affiliates, it's still about -- our income from affiliates is expected to be about $2 billion higher than the dividends. But no loan, no loan repayment. We had a little bit of repayment last year. Again, we had our first dividend in a number of years in December. And in the current price environment, obviously, we expect strong dividends from Tengiz this year. It's a matter up to their Board. And as the project is completed and comes on, then the ability to increase dividends further and pay back alone, and we'll share more on the cash flow generation capability of Tengiz during our Investor Day. Operator : Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Jason Gabelman : The first one is just on international gas exposure. Even backing out this timing impact, it looked like the realizations were a bit light. And I thought it would be helpful if maybe you could talk through that international gas exposure, the different pricing exposures within that, maybe splitting it up between pump-based, LNG-based, fixed price or however you think about the commodity exposure within that production bucket? And the second question, thinking about CapEx, I think your message is loud and clear that this year you're going to be around that $15 billion and you're going to manage the business to that. But as we look forward and think about where you could ramp up spend, is that $17 billion high end of the range? Is that where you think the kind of ramp up in spending you could do in your short-cycle basins? Or is there, in theory, if oil prices stay at elevated levels, can you ramp up in your short-cycle basins even more? And once again, I'm not thinking about this year, in particular, but in the future, if we're in an environment where oil prices stay elevated. Pierre Breber : Jason, I'll take your first question. So on our LNG portfolio, you can think of it about as an 80% oil linked, 20% JKM. That includes Australia but also West Africa, so Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. If you look to our international gas though, we have lots of other gas contracts around the world. As you say, some are fixed price, some are partially oil related with a lag. And so you won't see necessarily that direct effect. We have some that are low and, for example, in West Africa, that go to domestic markets. But if you look overall for the LNG, those 3 countries, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Australia, 80-20 is pretty good. Australia now is a little bit higher because we had an additional long-term contract, but the West Africa LNG is largely spot-related and JKM or TTF price-related. Michael Wirth : And on longer term CapEx, if I caught your question, Jason. Look, we get this range of 15 to 17. We've put out there. We're at the low end of the range. this year. Now that's a 30% step-up from where we finished 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, in a place like the Permian, it's a 50% step-up. So it's not a trivial change, but it's still a very disciplined approach to that business. And we intend to stay within that range as we've guided. Can we move around within it? Yes. Can that include additional short cycle, yes. And as we have -- as the project in Kazakhstan winds down, that opens up some capacity within that range to allocate capital to other high-return investments. And so we've got plenty of levers to pull. But I think the overarching message that investors should take away is we're going to stay disciplined on capital. We're not chasing price. We're improving returns and you can count on us to continue to do that. And we should generate very strong free cash flow in this environment. Jason Gabelman : Sorry, just to clarify, I think your guidance was on LNG. I was hoping to get it on the broader international gas price exposure. Pierre Breber : That's just a mix of contracts, Jason. I'd follow up with Roderick. I mean I think we show our realization by country, but we don't have a short hand on how to characterize because it really is a mix of contracts in a number of countries outside the U.S. Roderick Green : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Jen, back to you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.  Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : All right. Thanks, Roderick. Before we turn to first quarter results, I'd like to recognize the people of Ukraine. Our hearts go out to those affected by this tragedy, and we hope for a prompt and enduring diplomatic resolution. The last 2 years have been volatile and unpredictable, driven by the global pandemic and geopolitical conflict, creating strains on economies and markets around the world. Through it all, our objectives have been clear and consistent. And in the first quarter, we continued to make progress, delivering book returns in the mid-teens, investing to grow both our traditional and New Energy businesses and returning even more cash to shareholders while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet.  Recent events remind us of the importance of energy. Looking forward, I know that Chevron is doing its part, raising this year's Permian production outlook and advancing 2 important renewable fuel transactions : our Bunge JV, which is expected to close shortly; and the Renewable Energy Group acquisition, which is expected to close around midyear. While the future is uncertain, our actions are not. We're on a path to delivering higher returns and lower carbon and rewarding our stakeholders all along the way.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion or $3.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Included in the current quarter were pension settlement costs totaling $66 million and negative foreign currency effects exceeding $200 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  Adjusted ROCE was over 15% and our net debt ratio is below 11%. A third consecutive quarter with free cash flow over $6 billion, enabled us to return $4 billion to shareholders and further pay down debt. In addition, during the quarter, we received over $4 billion in cash, with about 3,000 current and former employees exercise stock options. This quarter's proceeds from option exercises were over 4x the historical annual average of around $1 billion per year.  About 2/3 of the vest adoptions at year-end 2021 were exercised during the first quarter, lowering the potential future rate of dilution from the outstanding balance. Over time, we expect our share buybacks to more than offset the first quarter dilutive effect.  Adjusted first quarter earnings were up $4.8 billion versus last quarter -- versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations while adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher margins, partially offset by negative timing effects. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up more than $1.6 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations and the absence of certain fourth quarter DD&A charges.  Liftings were lower in part due to lower production in the Gulf of Mexico. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on timing effects. The All Other segment was down primarily on unfavorable tax items and higher corporate charges. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.  First quarter oil equivalent production decreased 2% year-on-year due to the expiration of Rokan in Indonesia, lower production in Thailand as we approach the end of the concession and lower entitlements due to higher prices. Permian growth in the absence of Winter Storm Uri, impacts partially offset and drove U.S. oil and gas production up over 10%. Now looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect lower production due to planned turnarounds at Wheatstone and Angola LNG, impacts from CPC pipeline and the expiration of the Area 1 concession in Thailand. At CPC, 2 of the 3 single port moorings are now back in service and TCO has returned to full operations. Downtime associated with the April repairs is estimated to be less than 15% of our second quarter turnaround and downtime guidance.  We anticipate a return of capital between $250 million and $350 million from Angola LNG in the second quarter. This cash is reported through cash from investing and not cash from operations. In the first quarter, Angola LNG returned over $500 million of capital. The differences between affiliate earnings and dividends are not ratable and TCO has not yet declared a dividend in 2022. With higher commodity prices, affiliate dividends are expected to be $1 billion higher than our previous guidance.  We've utilized our NOLs and other U.S. tax attributes and expect to make estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments in the second quarter. These payments will flow through working capital accounts, just like our first quarter IRS refunded. In the second quarter, we expect to invest $600 million as we close the Bunge joint venture and to repurchase shares at the top of our guidance range.  With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick. Roderick Green : That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Katie, please open the lines. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : Mike, I want to start with one for you on Tengiz. There have been a number of events here in the quarter from the social unrest earlier in the quarter to the PC pipeline uncertainty and the moorings issues. So I recognize production seems to be back up and running to normal now. But I'm curious how you think about this in terms of the broader implications of what has been happening on the ground there and it's a very important asset for Chevron. So what are your latest thoughts? Michael Wirth : Well, Phil, it's an important asset, not just to our company but to the Republic of Kazakhstan and, frankly, to world energy markets in Europe, in particular. It's a significant supplier at a time when there are concerns about supply security that you're very familiar with. So we're focused on safe and reliable operations, as you would expect, protecting people in the environment and our assets, executing the major project, that's underway. And working with all the stakeholders that are involved in this. So that includes partners, it includes, obviously, the government of Kazakhstan and our customers. So the risks that I think you're referring to are risks that are present in Kazakhstan and in varying degrees, in other parts of the world as well. And that's part of what we do is manage those risks on the ground each and every day. There are times when the environment feels a bit more benign, but you can't take your eyes off those risks because they can materialize at any point.  So to this point in time, we've been able to make good progress on the project. Some impact really from the weather-related downtime at the loading buoys and lower assist. But 2 of those are back in service and the third one is slated for repair, which would give us plenty of redundant capacity there. So we continue to stay very focused on every aspect of managing that our people on the ground are empowered to do what it takes and to be very responsive in real time. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that they've done in a very challenging environment. Philip Gresh : Understood. I appreciate your thoughts. My second question would be for Pierre on cash flows or cash balances. The quarter did come in a bit lower than expected on cash flows, and I think you highlighted some timing factors. But you did get a bunch of cash from the stock vesting. So cash balances are up quite significantly. So I was wondering, I don't know if there's anything else to highlight on the moving pieces of the cash flow. But even at strip prices with your buybacks, it seems like cash balances will keep going up. So just what are your latest thoughts on managing the cash from here? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Phil. First, let me just talk about cash in the quarter. Cash in the quarter was very strong. As I pointed out, our dividends from affiliates are not ratable. And particularly from TCO, which historically has paid dividends in the fourth quarter, we increased our guidance on expected dividends, but they were light in the first quarter. So yes, that's timing. I also pointed out that Angola LNG returned $500 million of capital. That's essentially operating cash. That's a function of operating an LNG facility and selling it into the European gas markets at TTF prices.  However, adjusted to the accounting rules, it's flowing through cash from investing and not cash from ops. But for all intents and purposes, it is operating cash flow. And at some point in time in the future, it might revert back to that depending on the retained earnings in that affiliate. Another item I did not mention is that it's a typical item that happens in the first quarter. We pay out our long-term incentive compensation, which a portion of that is in the form of restricted stock and performance shares.  That is, again, happens annually, but with a higher stock price, that was a higher payment than in previous years. That does not flow through working capital. That comes out of a long-term liability account. And then as I mentioned, we expect to make estimated tax payments next quarter, but that will flow through working capital in many of analysts look at our cash flow ex working capital. But our IRS refund also went through working capital that we had guided to in the first quarter.  In terms of our cash balances, we're running a little bit high on our cash balance. That's why we refer to net debt, but we have a couple of cash items coming up. We expect to close REG around midyear. That's $3 billion. And we have an offering up right now to do a make whole call on about $3 billion of bonds. These are bonds that are economic to call back. And then on the buybacks, I mean, we just increased our buyback guidance at our Investor Day back in March to $5 billion to $10 billion We were at $5 billion rate here in the first quarter. We're doubling it now to the top of the range of $10 billion, and we'll just see where the environment goes from here.  We are not setting -- we are setting the buyback at a rate that we can maintain across the commodity cycle. We could have a higher buyback rate this quarter or next quarter, but the goal is not to maximize the buyback rate in any individual quarter. It's to set it at a level that we can maintain when the cycle turns. And therefore, we can rebalance our net debt ratio closer to our mid-cycle guidance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So the first one I wanted to ask is just on the Permian results and guidance increase. I was wondering if you could talk through in a bit more detail some of the drivers there. Are you adding activity? Is it better performance on the activity you had already budgeted for? Is it nonoperated? Just walk through some of the drivers there and how you're thinking about that. Michael Wirth : Yes, Devin, we did have a strong first quarter and a couple of big things to bear in mind there. As we slowed things down in 2020 when demand contracted due to the pandemic, what happened is we ended up with an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells that grew beyond what would be kind of a normal run rate for our rig fleet. And so we've been working through that and we're back down now to what you could think of as a more normal factory model. We always want to have docks out in front of the completion crews, but that had grown to a larger than normal rate.  So as we've caught that up, that's pretty efficient. It's the first place you turn as you see the cycle turn is completing those wells to get that production online, and we'll be moving into more of a factory model. So it will level out a little bit versus what might feel like a little bit of a surge. We also get some nonratable joint venture bookings that show up. And so both of those contributed to a very strong first quarter.  And of course, by the time you look at how that would roll through in the continued activity for the rest of this year, it's pretty clear that we'll end up higher than the initial guidance that we had put out. So -- but we haven't stepped up our program. We haven't stepped up a number of rigs. We haven't stepped up spending. It's all really a function of getting the machine running again. And then underneath that, there's ongoing efficiency improvements that we continue to see. Devin McDermott : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And my second question is on your global gas and LNG portfolio. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're looking at some of the medium and longer-term opportunities there given what's going on in markets. And specifically, I'm thinking about Eastern Med and that gas position. And then also whether or not integration into some type of LNG facility in the U.S. might make sense for some of your production growth there as well? Michael Wirth : Sure. So LNG is on everybody's mind these days. It's important to meeting Europe's needs. It's important to delivering a lower carbon energy system globally, and we see this strong market here in the near-term. Eastern Med is a wonderful asset. I was just over there 2 weeks ago. I visited the Leviathan platform, we spent a lot of time with our people in the business there. And they've recently completed a project to increase infrastructure access to regional markets and we're actually flowing more gas into Egypt as a result of that. We're looking at a number of other opportunities to further increased production because the resource there is quite prolific. And that includes further coal-to-gas switching in Israel for the regional supply into neighboring countries, potential power generation for power distribution through the region, floating LNG, potentially using oilage and other LNG facilities in the region, a number of different commercial options that are being evaluated and worked.  So more to come as those mature, but it's an area of high priority for us because the market demand for it. When you look at the U.S., clearly, we've got a lot of gas production here that largely prices at Henry Hub today. And there are these projects that are in the process for LNG export facilities. We've had discussions with a number of those developers, nothing to say more than we've had discussions at this point.  But that's part of our LNG portfolio that we've been very focused on the Pacific Basin historically. And as the Atlantic Basin markets now look a little bit different as we flow gas from our West African assets into the Atlantic Basin, it may make sense for us to have some U.S. supply as well. So we'll advise you as we advance anything there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Mike, I just love your perspective on the oil macro. You always have a good read on it. It strikes us that inventories for product and oil are very tight right now. You've got jet fuel recovering over the summer. We'll see what happens in China. Shale has an inelastic supply response. So how does this ultimately resolve itself in the near term? Do you ultimately need to solve or demand destruction through crack or flat price of oil? Or is there something that we're missing? Michael Wirth : No, Neil. I mean you're putting your finger on all the levers. If you step back from it, supply always responds more slowly than demands does. And in normal times, which we have not been in for the last couple of years, both of them kind of gradually move in relative sympathy with one another. You've got storage out there that can buffer any near-term imbalances. I'm repeating what you all know. But in 2020, we saw a contraction unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime. And we had to really constrain activity. There was no sense producing more oil when the world needed a lot less.  And it wasn't clear at the time how long that might last and how deep it would be. And so the entire industry, every segment of the industry responded to that. And then as we've come out of the pandemic, demand growth has surged. And as you say, we haven't seen it all come back yet. Air travel, while it's -- domestic air travel in the U.S. is pretty strong, international air travel still has a ways to go to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  And then China and other parts of the world are still in various stages of lockdown at various points in time. And so we haven't seen a full recovery of demand there. So even with that, demand has now responded more quickly than supply can match it. And then you overlay a host of other issues, right? The independent E&Ps feeling more of an obligation to return cash to their shareholders. Some of the big integrated companies have reprioritized new energy versus traditional energy and have indicated they intend to shrink rather than grow their oil and gas production.  And then the NOCs going around the world, everybody has got a little bit of a different situation. So it's a market that is not stable. It's not an equilibrium. Right now, as you say, inventories are quite low. Demand is still strong, and economies to this point seem to be handling it. At some point, particularly if prices were to move higher, I do think it starts to be a bigger drag on the economy than what we've seen to this point. But there's a lot of attention in this market and the supply response is coming. We're up 10% in the U.S. year-on-year. We're working on the big project in Kazakhstan, which will start up over the next couple of years. And others around the world have got things that they're doing as well. But it just comes in at a different pace than the demand has moved. And I think we're in a market that's tight right now, that has a lot of uncertainty and I think that is not likely to resolve itself in the near term, the uncertainty. Things like the SPR release in the near term can do a certain amount to call those markets. But over time, it's a cyclical business. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced at prices lower than we see today. And one of the lessons is history is just as the bad times don't last forever, neither do the times when prices are strong, and so we can't start to believe they'll always be like this. But I think in the relative short term here, the tensions that you referred to are likely to remain. Neil Mehta : It's a great perspective, Mike. Another big picture question is, if you think about 20 years ago at the beginning of the last super cycle, you had very similar, very large multiple arbitrages between the super majors and even large independents and some of the majors. And one could look at your multiple on consensus and say you trade a premium relative to a lot of the global majors. Do you think there's value in mega M&A in the space? And do you see yourself as a logical consolidator, given that M&A is such a core competency and it worked out incredibly well for you 20 years ago with Texaco? Michael Wirth : Yes. We're always looking at these things, Neil. I think history would suggest that deals done in an upcycle or near the top of the cycle don't necessarily look as well in hindsight as deals that were done in a different part of the cycle. 20 years ago, when there was a number of transactions that you referred to, we were coming out of oil prices in the teens or the '20s. And so consolidation made sense. There were a lot of synergies to be harvested as you put some of these companies together. I think the entire industry is more efficient today than it was then certainly large companies, which you refer to kind of large-scale M&A. And so I think the synergy opportunities, while no doubt there would be some, they may not be of the same magnitude that they were 20 years ago. We've all used technology and other things to improve the efficiency of our operations.  So I never say never, but I don't know that just because we're trading at a relatively strong multiple right now that, that should lead you to believe that it means we're more likely to do something that our track record of discipline would suggest. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question, maybe we just hit back on cash returns. The buyback for 2Q annualized again, is at the top of your range. And Pierre, I think you reiterated on Phil's question that buybacks are intended to be through the cycle. Can you just maybe provide a little bit of commentary on how you're viewing the buyback in relation to mid-cycle cash flow? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jeanine. The buyback rate of $10 billion is a company record, and previous highest buyback rate was back in 2008. And as you say, we want to maintain it across the commodity cycle. So we're very in tune with what our mid-cycle cash flow capabilities are. We showed at our Investor Day low case of $50 Brent and show that we can maintain the buyback for multiple years, even though $50 is notionally right around the breakeven for covering both our dividend and our capital. And then, of course, we showed the high case of $75 where buybacks were, in fact, higher than the current $10 billion guidance. And we could buy back at that point in time, it was more than 25% of the company, it's a little bit less based on the current stock price. So that's exactly how we're thinking about it. To Neil's question and the macro, it was just 2 years ago today on this earnings call, that Chevron was the only company to show a 2-year stress test at $30 Brent. And that was a real stress test. And we showed that we could maintain the dividend, invest in the business for long-term value. We certainly reduced some short-cycle capital.  And yes, we would take on some debt, but we'd have a debt ratio that would still be very manageable. And in fact, would be not far from where many of our competitors were entering the COVID crisis. So as Mike says, we're mindful of the cycles that are in our business, we have to plan and manage for them. Again, we could have -- we can afford a much bigger buyback program next quarter. We don't -- you know, Jeanine, that a net debt ratio under 11% is not what we're targeting. I mean that's just how the math works.  We grew our dividend 6% earlier this year. Our dividend is up nearly 20% since COVID, while many in the industry cut their dividends during the last couple of years. Our investment -- organic investment is up more than 30% versus last year. When you include our announced acquisitions, total investment is up 50%. So clearly, we're investing, as Mike has said, to grow both our traditional new energy businesses.  And we paid down debt, and we've been increasing our buyback as we've seen the strength of this upcycle and the likely duration of it increase, but the cycle will turn and we'll continue to do buybacks. And so we want to set the buyback at a rate that we can manage it, not only at our mid-cycle cash flow generation capability, but even when it goes below that. Again, we're going to -- there's going to be a time where we're going to be buying back shares, and we'll be doing it on the balance sheet because we want to relever back closer to that 20% to 25% net debt ratio range that I've talked about. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Very helpful. Maybe if we just can move back to the assets on the Permian. Permian for you guys is firing on all cylinders, clearly have a big asset there with huge long-term value. One of the things that has been talked about a bunch recently is just FT on the gas side and how you kind of see that evolving. Just wondering how Chevron is looking at that for your long-term plans. Michael Wirth : Yes, Jeanine, we -- I'm glad you talked about long-term plans because we've had a long-term Permian plan. And interestingly, notwithstanding one of the most volatile 2-year periods we've seen, our production profile doesn't look that different than it did just a couple of years ago in terms of where we're headed. And of course, that drives everything from contracting for rigs and completion services to takeaway capacity for oil and gas liquids and gas. We've got sufficient takeaway capacity for our production through the middle of this decade.  And as we look forward, we're working on what it takes beyond that period of time. So we don't flare in the Permian. And so we've got to be sure we've got gas takeaway or we're not going to produce oil. And so it's a high priority for our midstream team. But we don't see pinch points anytime soon, and we continue to be a very attractive shipper for the people that we do business with because we're predictable. We've got a strong track record of continuing to deliver the growth that we have indicated. We got a strong balance sheet and all those things mean that people like to do business with us. So we feel pretty good about that for the next few years. Operator : We'll take our question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. First on inflation. Pierre, just curious, I mean for your CapEx for the next, say, 2 or 3 years, do you have a percentage you can share? What percent of your CapEx is in pretty much fixed price contracts, so don't subject much to inflation and what percent is really quite vulnerable to inflation? And also when we're looking at your CapEx for this year, the Bunge JV $600 million investment, is that included in your original budget or that this will be in addition to your original budget? That's the first question.  The second question maybe is for Mike, that with the much sharply higher commodity prices, when you have discussion and negotiation with the NOC, the host government, is there a change in the attitude on that it become more difficult for you to get better terms? Or that this is happening too quick and so you haven't really seen any change in the way how you conduct the discussion with your counterpart in the national companies or the host government? Pierre Breber : I'll start... Michael Wirth : Pierre, do you want to start on -- yes, go ahead. Pierre Breber : Yes, I'll start on the first question. There are several parts to it. So first, the Bunge joint venture, anything that is an acquisition inorganic is not included in our $15.3 billion budget that we shared back in December. So I think we cited that, in fact, in that press release that Bunge would be in addition. And then the other potential inorganic, there was a little bit of inorganic in the first quarter that included an investment in Carbon Clean, a technology company. REG also will not be included.  You won't see REG though, even in our total capital, our total C&E because it's a company acquisition. Let me just talk about cost inflation a little bit. We are seeing more cost pressure in the Permian. It's manageable. But if we go outside the U.S. seeing hardly any or much more modest increases, and none of that is changing our $15.3 billion CapEx budget that we've talked about. I'll remind everyone that the Permian is 20% of our capital budget. So it gets a lot of attention.  But again, 80% of it is not -- or outside the U.S. is not seeing much cost pressure at all. In the Permian, as Mike said, we plan our business. So we have all the equipment and services to execute our plan. And we've seen a little bit more than we had budgeted, but we can offset some of that with efficiencies in the Permian and with reductions elsewhere in the portfolio. Our focus is turning to 2023 and securing all the equipment and services that we'll need to execute that plan. But we'll share the details as we update our annual budget, which we do every December.  In general, Paul, you can think that we contract 30% to 40% of our total supplies each year. So that every 2 to 3 years on a rotational basis, it can vary, it depends by location. But we don't -- notionally, we are going to be exposed to some of these higher prices as we move into future years. Again, we've been able to manage this year very well depending on -- due to how we contracted previously. Our $15 billion to $17 billion capital guidance, which goes on for 5 years, kind of assumes mid-cycle conditions. So it has the ability to absorb some of these cost increases that are transient. And so we'll execute within that. We have Tengiz coming off, which will open up more room in that capital guidance. And again, we'll share all the details when we release our capital budget in December. But the bottom line is we're seeing modest increase. As we said, overall, our capital budget had just a few low single digits of COGS inflation for this year, a little bit more than that in the Permian. It's all very manageable, and we're working hard to secure contracts for future years activity. Mike? Michael Wirth : Okay. Paul, your second question was on discussions with host governments on concessions and how that may be affected by the price environment. I would tell you that right now, we're pretty early into this price upcycle. And I'm not sure that I can say we've seen a lot of change as people are really adjusting to the environment we're in. But on the broader issue of concession extensions, look, we've got to find these opportunities and negotiations that create value for the company and for the host country. And so you really have to look at it through the lens of both.  We had long histories in both Indonesia and Thailand. I would have liked to extend those concessions that are rolling off last year and this year, but we couldn't find an outcome that satisfied the host governments expectations and that would compete for capital within our portfolio, which has got a lot of alternatives. The flip side of that is Angola, where we last year extended our Block 0 concession from 2030 out to 2050.  And that's a partnership that started more than 60 years ago. And there was a lot of common ground there on contributing to reliable and cleaner supply for Angola, reducing greenhouse gas emissions there and finding a way to do that on terms that will attract capital within our portfolio.  So we approach each one of these things, looking for value for our shareholders and to provide a proposition for other stakeholders that they find acceptable. Sometimes we can achieve that. Other times, we can't. So more to follow probably in terms of -- if this turns out to be a long upcycle, how that may change those dynamics. But I think the fundamental approach that we take is unlikely to change. Operator : We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. If we could maybe talk a little bit about some of the bigger projects, thinking about your answer earlier, Mike, on some of the macro items and under investment. I know you have some things in the Gulf of Mexico. You've obviously got an extensive LNG footprint globally. How do you think over the next couple of years blending in your kind of known deepwater projects and then the possibility of doing something again on the LNG front? Michael Wirth : Yes. So we've got a nice set of projects under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that will start up this year. Next year, we'll hit the first waterflood injection on St. Malo and some additional development drilling there. Big Foot, which is on production right now. We've got ongoing development drilling and water injection soon to follow. Mad Dog 2 is slated for first oil this year.  We've got Anchor, which is expected to have first oil in 2024. Whale also expecting to have first oil in 2024. We just sanctioned Ballymore, which we'll have first oil in 2025. So there are -- there's a queue of these things that is rolling through. And what's a little bit different than in the past is they're not all in the same phase of development at the same time. So I gave you those kind of in order of when they come on production. But we don't have them just sitting on top of each other. So a lot of the lessons of maybe the last upcycle, where don't take on more than you or your suppliers and contractors have the capacity to do well in any given period of time, and we're really trying to apply that here. So it doesn't get as much attention or interest as we get from the Permian these days or Kazakhstan, but a really important part of our portfolio, really nice projects and very low carbon energy for the world.  I mean, this is some of the lowest carbon intensity stuff in our portfolio. Our portfolio averages about 28 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. Our Gulf of Mexico averages 6. So it's not only economic, it's low carbon. It's something that I think that our country is blessed with and should continue to advance leasing in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.  On the other question, LNG. I addressed earlier a little bit of the -- we got a number of options in the Eastern Mediterranean. We're talking to some people here in the U.S. You may have seen media reports that we have been talking to people in the Middle East about expansion projects there. So we're evaluating a number of different opportunities. We'd like to grow our LNG position. The world needs it. But similar to my response to Paul, it's got to compete for capital. In our portfolio, Pierre mentioned, we're going to stay disciplined on capital. We've given you a range. We've stuck within that range. Ever since we started putting that out here, and that would be the intent. So just because something looks good through the lens of growth and commodity exposure is also got to compete for capital in a disciplined budget. And so we'll just see which of those, ultimately, if any, kind of past that screen. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow-up on LNG. I mean the last couple of quarters have been impacted by various LNG volumes offline. I know you've leased on an LNG statement in the second quarter. Any kind of clarity you can give in terms of how much volume impact that might have? And beyond that, can you give an update on the other potential volume disruptions across your LNG operations? Michael Wirth : Yes. So in the first quarter, we had a little bit at Gorgon from some of the things that we had talked about earlier. So some discovery work that was proactive, not related to an incident, but it was asset integrity work across all 3 trains. A little bit of that came into the first quarter of this year. Wheatstone has a turnaround underway right now of one of the 2 trains and also the offshore platform and some common facilities, which that requires both trains to come down when you take the offshore and common facilities down. The good news is that part of the turnover is behind us right now. And we're in the process of resuming production at one of the 2 trains there at Wheatstone and should have first LNG any day now. And actually, the second trend will be early May. So we're nearly through that turnaround. Then we also have a turnaround in -- at Angola LNG. And so that will be in the second quarter, late in the second quarter and that's really what we've got planned for this year. Second quarter takes all the planned turnaround activity essentially or the majority of it. Ryan Todd : Okay. And then maybe a second question on refining. Can you talk about some of the -- I guess, as you think about the -- some of the headwinds that were maybe felt during the first quarter and relative to headline margins, whether it's lag on timing effects or secondary products or things like that. Can you about how some of those trends may reverse or shift into the second quarter looking forward? And how you think about the ability to kind of capture some of that back as we look in through second quarter and third quarter? Michael Wirth : Yes. I'll take a pass, but Pierre might want to add something. Look, we see this in our downstream business. We're a little bit differently positioned than some of our peers in that we've got pretty heavy U.S. West Coast exposure and heavy Asia exposure, but then we're pretty light in the Middle East or Europe and some of the other basins. So our portfolio is a little concentrated more so than others. And so -- we're subject to the dynamics in those markets. China has been in a lot of kind of ongoing lockdowns.  California, frankly, has had a little more aggressive COVID policy longer than some other parts of the world. And so demand has reflected that to a certain degree. And then in a rising crude market, we have 2 effects that tend to roll through our downstream. One is just the way our inventory is valued and so in a rising market, we tend to see inventory -- negative inventory effects due to the LIFO accounting that we use. And we also tend to see -- we're long physical and short paper as we try not to take price exposure.  But that paper marks to market until the physical closes. And so in a rising market, your papers marking negative, the physical obviously, is gaining. And so you see that paper and then the physical deliveries you close out the paper and you match those up. So in a rising market, those 2 effects tend to cause negatives. I think in the second quarter of this year, we'll probably see a lot of that reverse. Operator : We'll go next to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : My first question is a quick clarification. You did indicate there was a storm at CPC. I think it came somewhere late March, but the impact would probably be felt more in 2Q. So help us understand how long the facilities were down? And how should we model the impact on production because of this particular storm? Michael Wirth : Yes. So -- yes, you want to handle that, Pierre? Go ahead. Pierre Breber : Yes. That's in our guidance, Manav, that we provided in -- for the second quarter production impacts from planned turnarounds and downtime. And again, the CPC TCO impact is about 15% or less than 15% of that total. Manav Gupta : Okay. And then the second thing is... Michael Wirth : And you're right, Manav. It was late March when it came up. So the effect is really in the month of April. Manav Gupta : Perfect. At your energy transition day, you had provided certain targets for growing your renewable fuel franchise, and REG gets you a very long way when it comes to renewable diesel. But another area you were generally bullish on was sustainable aviation fuel. You had indicated that long term, you believe this is a big growth market. So can you help us understand, since then and going forward, how does Chevron plan to build on its sustainable aviation fuel business? Michael Wirth : Yes, Manav. We -- obviously, aviation demand is going to grow as we go forward. And finding a solution, it's one of the hardest to decarbonize segments of the economy because you need to have high energy density for aviation fuels or planes can't carry much in terms of their cargo. So it's an area of focus. In a traditional refinery, the distillate portion of the barrel, you can move molecules from diesel to kerosene or jet fuel. And the renewable diesel investments that we're making, there's a certain flexibility that you have there as well.  And so we will have the ability to produce. In fact, we've already produced some sustainable aviation fuel at El Segundo. And we'll see more of that coming through some of our renewable diesel facilities. We have also get negotiations underway with some other companies that have different technologies that wouldn't necessarily be the same as what we would do in a refinery. And so we're looking at alternate pathways, feedstock partnerships and pathways.  This is all going to take time to come together. Quality control is really important in aviation fuels, reliability of supply is really important. And as we introduce new feedstocks, new technology pathways, you have to be really diligent in ensuring that the fuel that you ultimately produce and sell is going to perform in the engines that it's going to be consumed into. The last thing I'll say is none of this stuff is inexpensive. And sustainable aviation fuel today is not competitive with traditional aviation fuel from a cost standpoint. There has been some talk in Washington about various policy incentives that could be put into place to encourage more sustainable aviation fuel. There's a letter that was published by a whole host of people, airlines and others just in the last week or so calling for action. And I think to see this scale, we got to keep working on technology in feedstocks but it's likely that some sort of policy incentives will be part of the equation in order to see more capital drawn into sustainable aviation fuel. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Mike, I know you've plugged to death, I guess, the questions around CPC, Kazakhstan and so on. I wonder if I could just ask a slightly different question around what's happening to realizations, insurance rates, whether that could be a durable discount on the value of the barrel coming out of Tengiz and over what time line. So I don't know if you can offer any color there, but obviously, it's something we noticed going on in the market. Michael Wirth : Sure. So pre invasion, CPC discounts were maybe $1 or so to dated Brent. Post invasion, the trading range has kind of been $4 to $10 net prices at a pricing point called Augusta, which includes insurance and freight. So yes, there's been a move. It's, call it, $7 or $8 today, probably. Now absolute price obviously has moved up a lot more than that. But there's a little bit that you could argue as being left on the table. I think a lot of it, Doug, depends on how things are resolved in Ukraine and what the longer-term posture is relative to sanctions, the perceived risk of lifting at Novvi resis and how that translates into demand from customers and the expectations from shipowners and whether it's freight rates, insurance, et cetera, are people willing to send ships back in there the way they historically have or not.  So it's a hypothetical. I think that I can't really speculate on how that settles out. But I think it's a function of how this whole situation is resolved and what kind of risks people perceive on the other side of the conflict resolution. Doug Leggate : I know it's a tough one to ask in the relatively early stages of this whole thing. So thanks, Mike, for having a go. I guess my follow-up, and I think it might have been Neil mentioned it earlier, but your credentials on M&A are obviously probably the best in the industry now, Mike, and you've led that. So -- and well earned. But your balance sheet is in to a point as you thought it's kind of almost back to 2013, '14 levels, if you take -- project out a year or so. And there's strategic opportunities as this whole thing evolves, particularly perhaps in U.S. gas, LNG and so on.  So I wonder if I could ask the M&A question a little differently as well, which is when you look at your business today and how you've invested and how you've transitioned through Noble and so on, is there any way you would identify, for one of a better expression, a strategic want or a strategic hole that you would like to fill? And what would that look like? Michael Wirth : Yes, Doug, I appreciate the comments about our M&A track record and our financial strength. Those are 2 things that we've worked hard to establish. I'll tell you, we like our portfolio. We've provided, again, I think in this year's Investor Day, a 10-year outlook that says how much resource have we captured and could conceivably flow into production, not that,, that's a production to forecast, but it's really a look at resource depth.  We've talked a little bit today about gas. We're a little oilier than most. And so over time, can we increase some of our gas exposure would be one question. We like petrochemicals. We like CPChem a lot. We've got a big chemicals business embedded in Korea, in Genus Caltex. The growth prospects in the petrochemicals business continue to look attractive. And then we've been active in new energies. And so the renewable fuels business that we talked about, some other things that we're looking at in that space as well. And so look, we're trying to leverage our strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. And I think that drives the way we think about our portfolio today and tomorrow. And a number of things I mentioned there, right, are lower carbon contributions to economic growth and prosperity. So and -- that would be how we think about it. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're off to the races to do anything tomorrow because we like our portfolio as it sits today and don't feel like there's a hole that has to be filled in the short term. So we really can take a long-term look. We can be patient. We can be selective if we decide to do anything. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : First, I just wanted to clarify on the LNG maintenance. What is the cadence of maintenance across your assets going forward in future years? You've obviously had a period of very concentrated maintenance events. Is it 1 train a year? Or how do we think about that on a normalized basis? And then my follow-up is, just given the changing energy dynamics, I wonder if your discussions with governments, both domestically and abroad, if the discussions and the sentiment has changed at all in terms of the ability to invest in places. And if that's in any way starting to reshape the way you look at your investment opportunities? Michael Wirth : Okay. LNG turnarounds were typically at a 4-year turnaround cycle. So what that means is that Gorgon with 3 trains, you'll have 3 out of the 4 years, you'll have 1 turnaround. At Wheatstone with 2 trains, 2 out of every 4 years, you'll see a turnaround. And at Angola LNG, where we've got a single train, 1 out of every 4 years, you'll see a turnaround. On government discussions, it's just early, Jason, to say. I don't think anybody's really fully adapted or no one knows what the environment is likely to look like a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now. So I think that's one that is a work in progress. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : The first one is just thinking about the capital framework again. And through the various presentations in recent years, the management team has been very consistent in talking about improving book returns. I think, Pierre, you've been quite emphatic around stating that the market doesn't reward higher capital spending, given, I guess, the industry's track record. I understand the CapEx budget in the range was only put out there a short while ago, but obviously, a lot has changed in recent months. So the market clearly wants more energy. You are generating record amounts of cash, the buybacks are already at the top end of the range, shares are close to all-time highs. Do you think the market is sending signals yet that would support a capital budget increase beyond what you're doing in the Permian maybe through more exploration or otherwise? That's my first question. And the second question is on TCO and the growth projects there. Has anything that's happened in the last couple of months impacted your thinking around the time line to deliver those growth projects going forward? Michael Wirth : Yes. I'll -- Biraj, I'll take the second one, and then Pierre has been spending a lot of time with investors, and I'm going to let him talk to you about whether the market is signaling we ought to change our capital spend. On TCO, we just had a pretty extensive update on the project here. Week before last, we made good progress through the winter. We're close to having our annual cost and schedule update done. But the high-level message on that is we look pretty good on budget still. We look good on the schedule for the future growth project, which is slated up -- slated to start up in the first half of '24. A little bit of pressure on WPMP, which I believe our last update on that was second half '23, late '23. So cost and schedule despite the challenges of COVID and the other kind of regional uncertainties, still holding well. The project team there is doing an excellent job.  So I think Jay will be on the second quarter call and can give you a more complete run down on things. We will have all these costs and schedule reviews completed, but nothing there that signals a significant change. Pierre, maybe you can talk about signals from the market on capital? Pierre Breber : We don't intend to change our capital guidance. The objective is to sustain and grow the enterprise at the lowest capital level. We're much more capital-efficient than we were just a few years ago, let alone a decade ago. We showed and Mike just referred to, that we can sustain and grow our traditional energy business at very reasonable rates and rates that we don't need to grow faster, and we don't get paid for that. There's no time in the -- our history where the market has valued growth.  I mean that's why we emphasize return on capital employed because we are income-oriented, dividend-paying returns type of investment. And then, of course, we're growing new energies, and we have 2 big transactions are expected to close soon and more on the way. So if we're able to sustain and grow this enterprise, traditional energy at rates that are in line with industry growth rates, new energy faster. And we can do that at lower -- less capital, that leaves more cash flow for shareholders. And so what you're seeing, and back to Jeanine's question and other questions, we generate -- at whatever oil price you assume, we generate more free cash flow than we ever have in the past. And that means we're able to grow the dividend at very competitive rates and have this buyback that we can maintain across the cycle. So we are very sensitive to doing our part. And as we said, we're growing energy supply in the U.S., in the Permian and other locations.  At the same time, the objective for a capital-intensive commodity business is to do it in the most capital-efficient way. The more capital efficient we are, the more capital gets returned to shareholders. Roderick Green : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I am Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our CFO, Pierre Breber; and EVP of Upstream, Jay Johnson, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thank you, Roderick, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter, another quarter of strong financial results with ROCE over 25%, the highest since 2008. Special items this quarter include asset sale gains of $200 million and a $600 million charge to terminate early a long-term LNG regas contract at Sabine Pass. C&E for the quarter was nearly $4 billion, including inorganic spend to form our JV with Bunge. With the acquisition of REG, our total investment was $6.8 billion, more than double last year\u2019s quarter. Strong cash flow enabled us to fund this higher level of investment, pay down debt for the fifth consecutive quarter and returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Adjusted second quarter earnings were up more than $8 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations partially offset by lower liftings from the end of concessions in Indonesia and Thailand. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up nearly $5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations, partially offset by tax and other items, including higher withholding taxes on TCO dividends and cash repatriations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and a favorable swing in timing effects. The All Other segment was up due in part to a favorable change in the valuation of stock-based compensation. I will now turn it over to Jay. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil equivalent production decreased about 7% year-on-year due to expiration of our contracts in both Indonesia and Thailand, the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and CPC curtailments impacting TCO during April. This was partially offset by shale and tight growth, primarily in the Permian. In the Permian, we are delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon. Our development costs are down about 25% since 2019 and we expect to keep them flat this year by offsetting inflation with productivity improvements. An example of simul-frac where we perform completion activities on 4 wells at a time reducing cycle time by a quarter. We continue to design, construct and operate facilities to limit methane emissions. Two of our Midland Basin sites recently earned the highest ratings from Project Canary\u2019s independent certification program. Production is at record levels and growing in line with guidance with our royalty position, providing a distinct financial advantage for our shareholders. At TCO, the drilling program is complete and the final metering station is online. We expect to complete construction by year-end with remaining project activities, primarily focused on systems completion, commissioning and startup. Total project cost guidance is unchanged. WPMP startup is expected in the second half of next year and FGP expected timing remains first half of 2024. TCO\u2019s operations continue to generate strong cash flow, enabling a midyear dividend with project spend decreasing we are expecting higher dividends going forward. In Australia, we shipped 87 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone in the first half of this year, up over 10% from last year. Our reliability benchmarks in the first quartile and we intend to stay there with an ongoing focus on operational excellence. Gorgon Stage 2, the first backfill project is on track to deliver first gas in September. Our Gulf of Mexico projects are progressing well with Ballymore receiving FID as a tieback to Blind Faith, an example of leveraging our existing infrastructure to improve returns. The Anchor hull is currently sailing from Korea and work on its top sites continues in Texas. Lastly, we recently signed agreements to export 4 million tons a year of LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast with 1.5 million tons a year expected to start in 2026. These agreements leverage our growing U.S. natural gas production and expand our value chains in Atlantic Basin markets. Now, back to you, Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jay. We closed the REG acquisition last month and integration is going very well. We are pleased to welcome REG\u2019s talented employees to Chevron and CJ Warner to our Board. Our teams have already identified further commercial opportunities and we quickly acted to lower insurance and financing costs. In May, we launched our joint venture with Bunge. The JV is operating two existing crushers and evaluation work is underway to expand crush capacity and add pretreatment facilities. In carbon capture and storage, we closed on the expanded JV to develop the Bayou Bend CCS hub. The lease held by the JV is in Texas State Waters near large industrial emitters and we believe it is the first U.S. offshore lease dedicated to CCS. Also, we recently filed for a conditional use permit in Kern County, California to store CO2 emissions from one of our cogeneration plants. Now, looking ahead, in the third quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production in a number of locations. In downstream, planned turnarounds are primarily at our California refineries. We do not expect significant dividends from TCO or Angola LNG until the fourth quarter. Our full year guidance for affiliate dividends is unchanged, with upside potential beyond the top of the range depending on commodity prices. Also, we increased the top end of our share buyback guidance range to $15 billion per year and expect to be at that rate during the third quarter. In closing, we are executing our plans, increasing investment to grow both traditional and new energy supplies and delivering value to our stakeholders. Although commodity markets maybe volatile, our actions are consistent through the cycle and focus on our objectives to deliver higher returns and lower carbon. Back to you, Roderick. Roderick Green : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jay Johnson : Good morning. Devin McDermott : Good morning. So Jay, I wanted to congratulate you on the retirement plans and take advantage of having you here on the call. My first one is on TCO and it\u2019s great to see the project progress there. And with the WPMP portion of the project largely complete, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the remaining milestones for that second phase FGP as you progress toward that first half 2024 startup? Jay Johnson : Thank you, Devin, for both the retirement wishes and the question. For TCO, we have been just steadily making progress here and we had a very strong period in the first half of this year. We had the unrest in January, of course and then the team responded well after that even with some of the Omicron impacts. As we are finishing construction, we expect to finish construction on everything this year and be largely into the commissioning phase and this is largely putting together doing the pressure testing, filling with fluids, cleaning systems and preparing them for eventual startup. The WPMP that we expect in the second half of next year will be around enabling us to boost the pressure from the field up to the facilities. So we don\u2019t expect to see a material change in our production at that point in time, but it enables us then to move into the phase of startup for FGP, where we will start to see incremental production coming through the plant. And some of the big milestones we have already accomplished. All 40 production wells are already now produced and completed and actually producing into the plant that helps us with the transition from the high pressure to the low pressure phase. We have got the injection wells already completed, so we can begin the FGP startup. Field facilities are well underway in terms of the new gathering system. We will have about all the metering stations have to be converted to high pressure to low pressure. They will be done kind of one at a time, so we can maintain production through that period. So those are the \u2013 you won\u2019t see a lot of outward signs other than progress on the commissioning, the number of subsystems completed and that\u2019s really what we are moving into. Rather than percent complete, we are 93% complete overall now, what\u2019s going to be more important are just the rundown curves as we bring each system to completion. Devin McDermott : Great. Thank you. Very helpful and great progress there. And sticking with TCO in that part of your portfolio, there has been a lot of headlines around the CPC pipeline in recent weeks and months. I was just wondering if you could give us a status update on where things stand there? And then also to the extent that there were to be any further disruptions to flows on that pipe, can you talk a little bit about the impacts to operations for your base existing production in that area? Jay Johnson : The CPC continues to be an important export route for us. It handles the majority of crude that\u2019s being exported to Western markets. And it represents an important supply to the world. It\u2019s about 1.4 million barrels of oil a day coming through that. The oil that we put into the line from Kazakhstan carries a certificate of origin from Kazakhstan. And we have done a lot of work in Washington and Brussels to make sure people understand the importance of the pipeline to world supplies. And we have seen the reliability overall still in the capacity to be able to maintain at the levels we need. The interruptions that we have seen have been managed. We have gotten through those. And as we look forward, we just continue to work with the Kazakh government and with the International Consortium that owns and operates the CPC pipeline to maintain this important source of \u2013 or export route for the crude. There are some alternate export routes being developed, but CPC remains the primary and most important route for us. Devin McDermott : Got it. Just to clarify, at the moment, operationally, at normal nameplate and flow rates through the pipe? Jay Johnson : Yes, we are at full capacity both at TCO and through the CPC pipeline. They actually work quite well with us when they do have to take the pipeline down for ongoing maintenance, which all pipelines have to do from time to time. They coordinate with the producers. They are often coordinated with turnarounds that the producing facilities are undergoing. So, the recent downtime for CPC is they were dealing with some of the results of the survey work around the terminal was coordinated with the NCOC turnaround activities, so that it didn\u2019t have any impact at all on TCO\u2019s production. Devin McDermott : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes, good morning, team. And Jay, thank you for all the insights over the years and wish you well in your retirement, sir. Jay Johnson : Thank you. Neil Mehta : The first question is on capital returns and you guys raised the top end of the buyback guidance here. So just talk about the math that went into it and how you think about the optimal return of capital formation, whether it is through buybacks or dividend growth? Pierre Breber : Thanks, Neil. It\u2019s Pierre. I will take that. I will go through our financial priorities. They have been consistent for decades literally. The first financial priority is to grow the dividend. We have done that for 35 consecutive years, increased it 6% earlier this year. It\u2019s up 20% since right before COVID and it\u2019s doubled since 2010. The second is to invest and grow both traditional and new energy and you saw that our total investments first half of the year were up 80% versus a year ago. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we paid down debt. Our net debt ratio is at 8%. That\u2019s well below our mid-cycle guidance of 20% to 25%. And when we have cash in excess of those first three priorities, we buyback shares and we intend to do it ratably over the cycle. We have repurchased shares, 50 now last 19 years. We bought back almost $60 billion during that time at an average price around $90 a share, very close to the weighted average price during that whole time. And as you said, we just increased the guidance to \u2013 we just increased the top of the range of our guidance to $15 billion a year. That represents about 1% of our shares each quarter. The $15 billion annual rate is based on our current outlook. It was tested against a number of scenarios. The rate is consistent with our Investor Day upside leverage case, which was a $75 Brent flat nominal price over 5 years. As we have said with previous buyback rates, we intend to maintain buybacks at this annual rate for a number of years across the commodity cycle. As a reminder, our net debt is well below our mid-cycle guidance range. So we will continue buybacks even when the commodity cycle turns down and we will lever back up our balance sheet closer to that 20% to 25% guidance range. Neil Mehta : Fair. The follow-up is just on the Permian. Can you just talk about how you are thinking about the growth profile there relative to what you guided at the beginning of the year, does the upward drift in commodity prices change the way you are thinking about prosecuting that asset? Jay Johnson : Neil, I will start out with that and then Pierre can finish if he has got any other thoughts. The Permian \u2013 our approach to the Permian, as you know, for many years, has been to be very disciplined, very focused on generating the returns and the efficiency that allow us to be profitable regardless of the prices. And so we are not responding to short-term price, but we are increasing our activity levels since the turndown during COVID. And so we have seen our investment go up this year, it\u2019s $1 billion higher than it was last year. And we also see the number of wells that we are putting on production going up, we expect to do over 200 POPs this year. And so we are looking for about a 15% increase in our Permian production. We have increased 2 additional rigs in July. So we are running now with a fleet of 10 rigs across the Permian in the current time and we expect to maintain that through the second half. But I will remind you also one of our rigs today drills the equivalent of what two rigs could do in 2018. So using just rig counts is a little bit of a you have to be careful, because we are so much more efficient with our rigs. And each frac crew today is also completing roughly double the work they were doing back in 2018. So we are much more efficient than we were just 4 years ago. We expect to see our investment continue to grow. We have given you guidance of increasing our investment rate up to about $4 billion a year by 2024. And then I would expect to see it relatively flat after that as we just maintain an efficient operation across the Permian. We also have non-operated activity and we currently have about 9 net rigs running on the non-op side. And so that also contributes significantly to our production profile. Our guidance remains unchanged. We would expect to see about 1.2 million to 1.5 million barrels a day of production ultimately is our plateau. But as we continue to gain insights and knowledge and as we look at our efficiency, as we look at our portfolio and world demand that can change as we go forward. That\u2019s our guidance as we see it today and we will continue to update you as we move forward in time. Pierre Breber : My only add is it\u2019s also among our most carbon-efficient barrels in the portfolio. And as Jay has said, it\u2019s a demonstration of our \u2013 delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon. Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Jay, we would also like to wish you well and thank you for all your time over the years and we\u2019ll stick to two upstream questions just so we can get to last in before you leave. Our first one is on LNG. This week, there was an announcement that Chevron along with a couple of other partners that you guys reached FID on development that will help boost Angola LNG plant volumes. So can you talk about how you\u2019re viewing expansion opportunities in Angola and also hit on Equatorial Guinea where you also have kind of an equity position that feeds an LNG plant there? And is there a preference on how your involvement evolves with LNG plants because you have some ownership \u2013 some equity ownership, but we also know that you had a Cheniere agreement that you announced recently that was more just on the marketing front. So just wondering how you\u2019re seeing your role there on new opportunities. Jay Johnson : That was pretty good, Jeanine. I think you got three questions in there, and I\u2019m going to try and merge through those. Jeanine Wai : No. That\u2019s just one. Jay Johnson : I know. I\u2019m allowed to do that. I\u2019m the upstream guy. Look, on the LNG in Angola, you\u2019re right. We just took FID in the new gas consortium. There are two primary sources of gas for Angola LNG. Traditionally, it was built for the associated gas that\u2019s produced along with the oil resources in Angola. And that\u2019s been the main source of gas for Angola LNG up to this point. And we continue to develop new oil resources with our 20-year extension, just secured really good terms on both the oil and the gas. It encourages investment in that country. There is a lot of oil still in Block 0. So that continues unabated. And actually, the investment will move forward. The non-associated gas, in other words, drilling and developing reservoirs that are gas only is a new investment mode, and we\u2019re doing that through the consortium you mentioned. And that\u2019s designed to be supplemental gas so that we can keep the Angola LNG facilities full. And so the ongoing effort to keep that plant running, it\u2019s really economic because it builds on existing infrastructure that\u2019s already been built, the investments have already been made. And importantly, it\u2019s supplying needed LNG into the European market and also gives us exposure to that Atlantic Basin. So that\u2019s been a good project for us, and we\u2019re pleased to take that FID. In EG, again, we have exposure now to the Atlantic Basin through that project. We continue to produce there. There is not much more I can say other than that\u2019s also been a profitable area for us and it came to us through the Noble acquisition. So it was kind of one of those more hidden jewels. We talk about Eastern Med. We talk about the DJ Basin in particular. But EG is supplying a very good return to us through those gas and LNG facilities. In terms of our focus on ownership versus commercial, we\u2019re really pretty agnostic. We\u2019re looking for the returns and the scale that we can build out of the business. We\u2019re looking for multiple points of supply so that we can maintain an active and profitable portfolio. And so where we can do commercial deals and not have to use capital but to really be able to leverage other facilities, that\u2019s always a nice way for us to go, and I\u2019m pleased to get that exposure out of the Gulf Coast into both European and potentially Asian markets. It gives us an access for a lot of our produced gas in North America to access those markets rather than just U.S. But where it makes sense, we will also make investments as we have in other places and own the facilities or run them through joint venture facilities or non-operated facilities. We really look at what gives us the best to generate the returns we\u2019re looking for. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you. We won\u2019t sneak in our unrelated follow-up since that was very fulsome response. Thank you. Jay Johnson : Okay, thanks, Jeanine. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Jeanine. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. 41 years in one place, Jay, that\u2019s pretty impressive. Congratulations. Jay Johnson : Thank you. Doug Leggate : I wonder if I could take maybe two questions for you, actually. Maybe Pierre might prefer the second one. I want to go to the Permian first. You have about half year production operated and half non-operated. Can you parse between the inflationary pressures between your operated and non-operated from what you\u2019re seeing currently? Jay Johnson : It\u2019s difficult for me to really do that definitively. What I can say, though, is I think we have a competitive advantage in the Permian. We have a couple of things working in our favor. We maintain a global supply chain and we\u2019re able to tap suppliers of both equipment and materials, goods and services over a much broader range than maybe some of our competitors. We also do multiyear contracts and other mechanisms commercially that allow us to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we see today. And then, of course, our focus on driving for improved productivity, improved efficiency has really helped us continue to counter the inflationary pressures. I think the other area that we have a distinct advantage is we\u2019ve been building out our infrastructure in the Permian. And so just as a proof point, the last 800 wells over the last 5 years, to produce those 800 wells, we had to build 40 central tank batteries. As we look forward, the next 800 wells, we only need to build an additional four central tank batteries. So while others are having to invest in this high inflationary period, we\u2019re largely using infrastructure that was built over the past 5 years with very small incremental surface facilities required. And I think that\u2019s going to be hard for others to match. Doug Leggate : So that\u2019s a very clear answer. Thank you. Pierre, I don\u2019t know quite hard to ask this question. I\u2019m going to try and get a party and a part of you perhaps, I\u2019ll be respectful. Mike was interviewed recently talking about the tightness in the global oil market. I think you said something like I know to put words in his mouth, but any weakness in oil prices is going to be fleeting because of the under investment. And you guys obviously have stepped up your spending from COVID levels, but you\u2019re still well below pre-COVID levels \u201816 through \u201819, let\u2019s say. With your balance sheet where it is in the depth of opportunities that you obviously have that you\u2019re not funding, how should we think about your continued commitment to the current CapEx level? Or do we see Chevron reengage in organic growth at some point? Pierre Breber : You should think that there is no change in our guidance. There is \u2013 our 2022 capital is on track. It\u2019s likely to end up below our $15 billion budget. We\u2019ve been ramping up during the course of the first half of the year, and I think you\u2019ll see us higher in the second half of the year, but likely end the year below our $15 billion budget. Our guidance that we shared at our March Investor Day is $15 billion to $17 billion of organic capital investments through 2026. Our budget this year is around $15 billion. So we have $2 billion of room to increase activity and investment within the guidance. And then as Jay just described, our major capital project in Kazakhstan is winding down, it will decrease spending by about $1 billion, and that opens up another $1 billion. So we have \u2013 we will increase investment in activity next year. I expect that we\u2019re doing that work right now. We will share the details in December when it\u2019s finalized and approved by the Board. But we will increase it within the guidance. And that guidance enables us to sustain and grow the Upstream business, as we\u2019ve talked about, 3% compounded annual growth rate between now and 2026. Add to our refinery capacity. We bought a refinery in Pasadena, Texas in 2019, kept all of our U.S. refineries through COVID and are making investment in that Pasadena refinery that was just recently FID. And of course, all the activities we\u2019re doing to grow new energies. We can do all of that within the guidance. And as we recognize, Jay, one of the things he deserves a lot of credit for is our upstream business is much more capital efficient than it\u2019s ever been. And has a mindset of how do we deliver business results with less capital. And if we do that, there is more free cash flow for shareholders. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your growth in the Gulf of Mexico in the upstream? You\u2019re leaning in there with number of brownfield projects. So can you just speak broadly on how you view on within your portfolio? And how the returns look on those bolt-ons relative to your other options globally in the upstream? And then what does the service inflation picture look like in that part of your system relative to, say, the Permian? Jay Johnson : Thank you, John. I\u2019ll start this and let Pierre add in. But we\u2019re really quite pleased with the portfolio we maintain in the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s a good area of exploration for us. And it has some of the lowest carbon intensity in the world. It\u2019s about 6 kilograms of equivalent per barrel produced. So on a world scale, and even our company scale, which is already top quartile, it\u2019s right at the bottom end of that range. So this is a great area to develop for future production and carbon efficiency. When we look at the queue of projects we have, we\u2019ve got the Anchor project that is expecting to have first half in 2024. We\u2019ve got Whale is coming through. We expect in 2024. We\u2019ve been expanding our existing facilities. We\u2019re starting up the Waterflood at St. Malo, which is part of the Jack St. Malo complex. We\u2019ve installed our multiphase pumps and are commissioning those. That\u2019s going to be an important milestone technologically and our ability to step out further and further. We just took FID at Ballymore. And Ballymore is an interesting one because it was a nice size discovery, but we could really capitalize and get a much higher return by taking three wells back to a host facility, at Blind Faith and be able to develop that. So we\u2019re pleased to be able to see that higher return coming from Blind Faith. And it also helps our existing production at Blind Faith. As we continue to work forward, I think we\u2019re going to see growth in our Gulf of Mexico production, but it\u2019s going to be important that we continue to be able to lease and acquire additional acreage in that basin, along with others because there is still, I think, room for continual exploration and tie back to this great chain of infrastructure that we have, be able to produce this lower carbon fuel. Pierre Breber : Only add is our rigs were largely contracted when rates are lower. So clearly, offshore rigs have increased, but we\u2019re largely contracted at prior rates. Thanks, John. John Royall : Great, thank you. Yes. So on the downstream I just had a question on particularly California, just kind of your go-forward views there. Product balance is not quite as tight as they are in other parts of the country. But then we\u2019re seeing some capacity come out due to RD conversions there. And so just looking for maybe your medium-term view on refining and California specifically? Pierre Breber : On the downstream side, we had a strong quarter. Well, good execution, reliable operations, high refinery utilization, and I\u2019m talking generally now, U.S. West Coast and Gulf Coast, good cost control, and we\u2019re able to capture the margins in the marketplace. We had a slight benefit in the second quarter because the Richmond turnaround was deferred. So it was a little bit less of an impact than what we had guided to on the first quarter call. And timing effects really weren\u2019t a driver right, timing is more of the absence of timing effects that you saw. In terms of these markets, they are volatile right now. I mean, we\u2019ve seen margins come off from where they were before. In the second quarter, we saw a demand response. On gasoline, probably around the mid-single digits across the U.S., a little bit higher on the West Coast, a little bit lower in the Gulf Coast. I didn\u2019t really see much on the diesel side. And Jet is really tied to the recovery of travel. So we will just see where the market takes us, whether it\u2019s West Coast or Gulf Coast, we\u2019re focused on safe, reliable operations, continuing to have good cost control and delivering products that our customers are demanding. Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have one on the upstream portfolio and then one on the financials. On the upstream, can you just talk about your other gas opportunities that you have available in the queue. Specifically, I am thinking about the Eastern Med. I know you\u2019re delineating some acreage there and it seems like there is a lot of gas available to exploit. And then also, I believe you have a Haynesville position. I am not sure if that\u2019s in the money or not and that\u2019s what\u2019s that you are looking at? And then I\u2019ll ask my follow-up after. Thanks. Jay Johnson : Okay, thank you. We have a lot of gas opportunities, and we\u2019ve got a lot of infrastructure to build those opportunities on, which is really important because it gives us an advantage from a return standpoint. In the Eastern Med, which I\u2019ll add is one of the lowest carbon intensity areas from a Scope 1 and Scope 2. We\u2019re at 2 kilograms of carbon equivalent per barrel produced. We have, of course, supplied a lot of gas into the Israeli market and that opportunity continues to grow as coal is displaced. We also take that gas into Jordan for conversion to electric power. And now we\u2019re taking it into Egypt, work and supply, both domestic needs in Egypt, but also potentially access some of the hullage that exists in the LNG facilities that are already existing in Egypt. We\u2019re considering floating LNG as well. As you know, there are very benign conditions, Med Ocean conditions in the Mediterranean that lend themselves to floating LNG. So it represents a viable option for us. Developing additional gas capacity at Leviathan and Tamar is well within the scope of those projects and would allow us to access these additional marketing opportunities through the LNG and the flexibility that provides. We continue to have some upside potential in additional fields through EG. And then we\u2019ve got access, as you pointed out, in the United States. We are ramping up our drilling activity in the Haynesville, and we expect to see rigs there starting later this year. They will be working in that area. It was very profitable even at the low prices, it\u2019s profitable now. So again, our focus is going to be on discipline on continuing to drive for those efficiencies, but we really are excited to get Haynesville underway and add that to our portfolio in that part of the country. Thank you. Jason Gabelman : Great, thanks. And my follow-up is just on the share count. I believe it went up again this quarter despite the buyback. And it\u2019s gone up since the buyback started. I think if you back out the shares issued for Noble, it\u2019s been flattish. So can you just discuss exactly what\u2019s going on there and your expectations for their share count moving forward with the higher buyback but also at a higher share price? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yes. The share count is going down and will go down. What you see in the earnings press release is a weighted average during the course of the quarter, not necessarily the end of the quarter. So you\u2019ll see in our Q that the share count at the end of second quarter is, in fact, lower than the first quarter, which you\u2019d expect as we bought back 2.5 billion shares and issued 0.8. The first quarter, we had these very large issuances for our employees and retirees exercising stock options. And so we started the year with a lower share count, issued those for our employee retiree stock options, therefore, started second quarter at a higher rate and then worked our way down. So the math does work. It is going down. It\u2019s \u2013 you have to look at end of quarter to end of quarter. But what you see in terms of earnings per share, it\u2019s an average over the quarter, and it\u2019s kind of a quirk that second quarter average was higher than the first quarter, but just the nature of the pattern during the quarter. Share counts are going down. Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : Thank you, guys. My first question here is \u2013 I wanted to take expertise from Jay again. This was a heavy turnaround quarter for you. But even then, some of the things where you were turning around were very high-margin barrels for you, so whether it was TCO, Angola or Wheatstone. And help us understand, like in terms of opportunity cost, if this volume was somewhere in the lower margin business versus some of your higher-margin business because you\u2019re trying to say upstream results were good, but they could have been even better because some of the higher margin barrels were actually in a turnaround? Jay Johnson : I appreciate the question. Manav, one of the things that\u2019s really important to us is that we operate safely and reliably. And so we look and we schedule our turnarounds and they are predominantly to ensure asset integrity and ongoing reliable performance. And when we schedule those, we don\u2019t like to shift those because of market conditions. And so we tend to want to execute those on time. What\u2019s important is that we execute them within the time frames that we expected so that our production is in accordance with our planning. And both Wheatstone and Angola LNG were done really, really well. I was proud of our teams, they went in, they did the turnaround. This means now in Australia, all five trains have been through the first round of turnarounds. And so that\u2019s an important milestone, an important accomplishment. This work that we do, while it may seem like we\u2019re giving up some opportunities in the near-term, it allows us to continue to drive higher and higher reliability, which means our overall production will be higher and our costs will be lower and our safety will be higher. And so that\u2019s really how we think about this. Manav Gupta : Thank you. And I have a quick policy question. About 1.5 months ago, things got a little heated between the oil companies and the White House. But as we understand, when the actual executive meetings happen between you guys and all the others and the Secretary of Energy, those are pretty cordial and you guys are looking for solutions out there. Help us understand what happened in the meeting with Energy Secretary and how did those go? Pierre Breber : Manav, we won\u2019t comment on the specifics of our engagements. I think you\u2019re right that we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s constructive and productive. I\u2019ll point out our U.S. oil and gas production in the first half of the year was up 7% versus last year. Our U.S. refined product sales up 10% versus last year. The administration wants energy supplies to increase, we\u2019re doing that. Our investment globally, up 80% first half of the year. If you look at the U.S., more than double when you include REG, so Chevron is growing energy supply, increasing investment and we are engaging constructively with Congress and this administration. Thanks, Manav. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one for me on Australia. I mean there is gas shortages in many geographies and Europe, in particular, but there has been some talk about or noise around that in Australia. I wanted to understand whether we should expect any export issues at Gorgon and Wheatstone? Are you in discussions with the government around proportion of gas going to domestic market versus what\u2019s being exported or anything like that? So, any color would be great. Thank you. Jay Johnson : Thanks Biraj. The shortages that you have heard about in Australia are all on the East Coast, and there are no pipelines connecting the West Coast and the East Coast. So, actually, the only way that we could supply any gas to the East Coast of Australia is in the form of LNG. So, we are under long-term contract with customers throughout Asia. We also sell into the spot markets with those facilities. We have interest in Northwest Shelf as well as, of course, Wheatstone and Gorgon. The Western Australian market is well supplied. It\u2019s a part of our agreements for that supply. And so there really are no issues. I don\u2019t see any impact to our export capabilities in Australia. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Understood. And just a follow-up on the same topic. A couple of years ago, I think I had a conversation with Pierre around the potential for increasing nameplate capacity at Gorgon and Wheatstone over time. And as you go through the various debottlenecking exercises, are you able to provide an update on whether that\u2019s still in the works, where you are? And what kind of timeline that would be on, if that\u2019s possible? Jay Johnson : Yes. We continue to focus on incremental capacity increases at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And that can happen through expansion of debottlenecking where we actually expand the capacity of the facilities. But importantly, it also happens as we increase the reliability of facilities and their utilization is higher. If you just look at this year, we have supplied 87 cargoes. As I said, that\u2019s up 10% on production from last year even with the turnaround that we had. So, you can see the improvement happening there. We have seen capacity increases at both Wheatstone and Gordon, and I would expect those to continue as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hi. Good morning. Pierre Breber : Good morning Sam. Sam Margolin : I wanted to revisit the LNG topic and maybe specifically to the Permian. Because there is just a lot of resource in the Permian that\u2019s not commercial, and that\u2019s \u2013 that includes different zones of what you are already developing plus areas that are not on your development calendar in the near-term. And LNG didn\u2019t historically help with that because it\u2019s expensive, but obviously, things have changed now. And so I would just love your perspective on what happens to your Permian resource or your overall opportunity there or the duration of it in an environment where you can add some extra capital or even commit to a spread, but monetize gas for a double-digit price. Jay Johnson : Look, I would characterize it what determines our pace of activity in the Permian is a balance on what we can accomplish efficiently. We have a factory model all the way from land acquisition. We do deals all the time to fill in the checkerboards and ensure an efficient development plan. As an example, just since 2017, we have executed over 260 transactions that have added 3,500 long laterals. That\u2019s allowed us to drive for this efficiency and the higher returns. Our activity levels really aren\u2019t determined by how much we can export from the United States. All these projects that we have would be economic at much lower prices. So, it\u2019s really not the price that\u2019s unlocking the Permian, it\u2019s developing the infrastructure for export from the basin into the markets that we supply, both domestic and international. So, it\u2019s all done in a coordinated fashion. We do it. So, we stay within the capability of the organization to execute efficiently and safely. And that\u2019s really what drives the Permian. So, it\u2019s nice to have access to these additional markets and the optionality they provide. We have an advantage in working closely with our midstream group who has great capability, both again for the domestic off-take and setting up potential for international export, but it\u2019s really not what I would view as the limiting factor on our pace. We determine that based on our overall balance of free cash flow, the returns and our resource and reserve replenishment. Sam Margolin : Okay. And then, I mean maybe just to follow-up, like, are there any ancillary factors that might be a consideration like an opportunity to fit another CCUS project on a facility or what it might contribute to like a flaring mitigation effort or anything besides just, like you said, a price signal? Jay Johnson : As Pierre said earlier, the Permian actually has very good carbon intensity on the Scope 1 and 2 basis. We are at 15 kilograms of CO2 across the basin. We are now benchmarking our facilities and achieving certification of platinum status on most facilities with Project Canary which then provides independent third-party certification of our methane emissions and the performance that we have been talking about. We are working with both our Chevron Technology Ventures, which is our venture capital arm and our New Energies segment on the carbon capture and sequestration. And carbon capture in particular, is critically important for not just us, but the world. And so we have three pilots going on at San Joaquin Valley operations to capture the CO2 that\u2019s coming off of our cogen units there. And then of course, we are gaining experience at Gorgon and Quest [ph] up in Canada, where we learn more and more about what it takes to effectively and efficiently sequester CO2 into storage. So, these are all going on. The beauty of having a portfolio like we do is we can put these pilot projects and we can put these demonstration projects wherever it makes the most sense, both from a regulatory, fiscal and return standpoint and develop these technologies that we are all going to need going forward. Pierre Breber : Thanks Sam. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe Generale. Irene Himona : Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter. I wanted to ask, first of all, about what you are seeing on the ground in terms of any signs of persistent demand destruction at retail, but also at industrial customer level, please? Pierre Breber : Irene, I said it very quickly earlier, I mean we have seen, I would call it, demand response to higher prices that in the second quarter was about in the mid-single digits in the U.S. on gasoline. Again, a little higher on the West Coast, a little lower on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I think we have seen some recovery since because prices have come off, so we will see where our third quarter ends up. On diesel, it\u2019s very hard to see, not price sensitive, it\u2019s tied to commercial industrial activity, maybe a little bit of a response at retail diesel. And then jet is largely tied to the recovery in air travel. I think people are wanting to get out and see people in places. Asia, where we also have retail is a little more variable because there has been still COVID restrictions and so it\u2019s hard to kind of see the data. I mean what\u2019s interesting is there is obviously concerns around the recession. In terms of tailwinds, we still have very low unemployment, and we have a consumer that wants to spend money to go out and do things they haven\u2019t been able to do for a couple of years. When prices were higher in the second quarter, they made some choices. And if you look at that demand response on gasoline, that\u2019s in line or even higher than some past recession. So, it\u2019s not clear. I guess what I would say is demand, I think will be much more recession resilient going forward just because we have seen a little bit of that response in the second quarter. And again, diesel will be tied to underlying commercial activity. And I think jet will really depend on if the airlines can get all the flights scheduled and have pilots and all the rest and some of the challenges that have been happening over there. So, that\u2019s a little bit of a sense of the demand. We saw a response second quarter, seeing some of it come back here early third quarter, and we will just see where it goes from here. Irene Himona : Thank you, Pierre. For my follow-up, and as you mentioned you are launching some new carbon capture projects. I wanted to go back to Australia and ask if you can possibly talk around the recent performance at the Gorgon carbon capture project. Is utilization improving? And is there any read through perhaps on the technical side from that project to the ones you are launching now? Thank you. Jay Johnson : Thanks, Irene. At Gorgon, we have now stored successfully about 6.6 million tons of CO2 into that reservoir. The \u2013 ironically, the biggest issue we are having currently is just the ability to remove water at a sufficient rate from the storage reservoir to create the space for the CO2 to enter. We have already demonstrated the capacity and capability to inject full CO2 rates into that reservoir, but the water that we are producing has some solids in it and some other contaminants, ironically, oil and gas because it\u2019s an oil and gas basin. And we need the surface facilities that can just remove those before that water is injected into a third reservoir. These are not new or particularly high technology challenges at all. It\u2019s what we deal with in everyday life around the world. So, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s compounded a little bit because Gordon sequestration is in a Class A nature reserve, so it\u2019s a very cumbersome process to approve additional facilities and additional wells. But these problems are solvable. And they do not represent, in my view, any kind of a restriction on the viability of carbon sequestration as a means of storing CO2 for long periods. What I would expect is that and we said this before, as we learn, as we go through this, what it\u2019s teaching us is that there are uncertainty ranges on any reservoir, whether you are producing from it or injecting into it and having sufficient contingencies and mitigations, depending on where you find yourself in those uncertainty ranges when you actually put the facility into operation is important, and we will need to keep these in mind as we develop sequestration projects around the world. So, the science is good. The technology works. It\u2019s just the basic issues that we face on reservoirs around the world that we now need to overcome. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi guys. Good morning. And Jay may I add my congratulation and thank you for the help over the years. Really, I appreciate it. Jay Johnson : Thanks Paul. Paul Cheng : Two questions. First, you touched on the inflation in different parts of your business. But can you give an over or given your footprint, can you give us an overall view that what is sure on expectation on the inflation for next year? I know it\u2019s still early for your budget, but are we talking about 10%, 15%? Some of your largest suppliers seems to suggest that everything is all used up in terms of manpower and equipment. , I don\u2019t know whether that you agree with that assessment. And if you can tell us that where you see along the supply chain, is the biggest maybe pass upon and where that you see the least inflationary pressure? So, that\u2019s the first question. The second question on Mexico and Brazil. You guys entered I think a couple of years ago and had some block over there. But I haven\u2019t heard you guys talk too much about those. So, where those rank within your portfolio today? And what is the next step in those? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks Paul. I will take the first, and then I will hand it to Jay on the second. On the onshore U.S., we have seen cost inflation this year in the single digits. We have been able to mitigate a part of that through good planning, smart procurement and good relationships with suppliers. And as Jay pointed out, we have been able to also get more efficient with our drilling and completion operations, which also partially offsets it. Outside of the U.S., we are seeing much more modest inflation, and we talked about our Gulf of Mexico offshore rigs, which are contracted at a time when the rig rates were lower. As we are looking towards 2023, we are doing that work right now. We are confident that we will be able to secure all the goods and services that were needed for our program. Again, our program will be a higher activity program next year, and that includes the Permian. And we will share estimates of what we are seeing in terms of COGS inflation when we disclosed our CapEx budget in December. We are just in the middle of that work right now, I feel very good that we will have all the goods and services that we need, and we are finalizing our plans. Jay? Jay Johnson : Yes. Thanks. And Paul, in terms of Mexico and Brazil, we have not had exploration \u2013 significant discoveries there. We are turning our attention, I would say, towards Egypt, where we have a very nice exploration position. We are shooting seismic. These are in areas that have been unexplored before because they have been in restricted areas and now available to us as well as in Suriname. So, as we do an exploration, we are always going through and looking for the next opportunities, but I would say our focus primarily is shifting now towards Egypt and Suriname. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our last question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe first one on the biofuel side. Closed both the REGI and the Bunge deals within that business. Can you talk a little more about what you are seeing in those markets? And whether you can elaborate at all about the broad types of commercial opportunities that you see that you mentioned in your prepared remarks? Pierre Breber : Thanks Ryan. We are really excited to welcome REG\u2019s people to Chevron and CJ Warner to our Board. She is already participated in our first Board meeting, is fantastic, has great knowledge of traditional and new energy businesses, and it\u2019s just a great add to our Board. As I have said, we had some sort of early wins. I won\u2019t get into the details of the commercial opportunities, but what we saw in the combination, the strength that REG has in terms of feedstock acquisition primarily of waste oils, and then combining that with our retail and marketing footprint. And just bringing two great teams together, we are seeing, as you would expect, one plus one is more than two. We have got our renewable fuels business headquartered in Ames, Iowa. And we are very excited about it. We closed in mid-June, just a comment on the accounting. There were no results in our second quarter results because we chose a convenience day of June 30th. So, all you will see and all you saw in our earnings release and you will see in the Q is just the purchase accounting starting in third quarter, then we will see REG in our results. REG had a good second quarter. Margins have been bouncing around, but the results are largely in line with expectations and Geismar continues on track. And same thing with Bunge, operating two crushers, very excited to be part of that, invested in CoverCres [ph] jointly, which is a crop that won\u2019t compete with food. So, lots of work in this space as we work to get our renewable fuels capability up to 100,000 barrels a day. Still working, still on track to convert a diesel hydrotreater at El Segundo to have renewable fuel capability and work across other parts of Chevron systems. So, the combination of REG, our Bunge joint venture and our own assets, along with our customer relationships, we are all putting that together to have what we think will be a very successful, viable renewable fuels business. Ryan Todd : Thanks Pierre. Maybe the final one for Jay. Congrats on the retirement. I wanted to kind of a higher level question on upstream project development and technology. And there has been a pretty significant shift over the last 5 years to 10 years in the way that you have approached project development, more standardization, oftentimes smaller and more capital-efficient style projects. Ballymore is a great example of this. It\u2019s lowered the cost of supply a lot, especially in the deepwater. As you pass the baton and look forward kind of into the next 10 years, are there things that you can see on the horizon either strategically or technologies that may continue to drive, changes in project development and technology that may drive things forward even further, whether it\u2019s 20,000 kit in the deepwater sort of from flow line improvements and allow longer tiebacks. And what could this mean for the future of your resource development portfolio? Jay Johnson : Thanks for the question, and it\u2019s pretty exciting. I mean the one bad thing about retirement is you don\u2019t get to be part of the next steps, and I am excited about them. I would start by just saying, I think we have accomplished a mindset shift in Chevron, and this is throughout our workforce, being very focused on returns, not chasing a production target, but continuing to run this as a business and thinking about the returns we can get. Scale is important, but it\u2019s an outcome of the opportunity set that we have and the investments and capital that we choose to invest. Getting more focused, the factory model has been really important to us. And ironically, the started where we drilled lots of wells in places like [indiscernible] and San Joaquin. We have now successfully transferred that into our unconventional plays in Permian, in the DJ, in Argentina. And now we are actually taking that factory model into places like the Gulf of Mexico, where we do what we call urban planning, and we try and have a steady progression of projects, and we are developing the capability for further and further reach. I mentioned earlier that Jack St. Malo is now putting into service multiphase pumps. And these multiphase pumps sit on the sea floor, but they allow us to reach 30 miles, 40 miles and even maybe 50 miles out from the host facility, which really gives us great capacity to make even smaller accumulation economic, and give us the returns we are looking for while extending the life of these major hubs. I think the Gulf of Mexico will continue to be an important proving ground for some of these technologies that can then be exported around the world. So, our focus on standardization, our focus on minimum viable facilities, our focus on capital efficiency over just scale and NPV, all these together are resulting in and aligning with our technology center so that we continue to develop the technologies that are giving us the returns that we are going to need going forward. And with the resource base that we have today, and the team of people that we have in our technology groups and in our businesses, I am really excited. Pierre Breber : Hey Ryan, thanks for that question. We will miss Jay, but his legacy will live on, and you will see it in the performance at the upstream has been delivering and will continue to deliver. Roderick Green : Thanks Ryan. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone\u2019s participation on today\u2019s call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2022 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Sarah. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I will now turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We continue to see a challenging and dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Current events highlight the importance of balancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection. In line with these 3 imperatives, Chevron remains focused on our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress by delivering return on capital employed in the mid-20s, returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the second quarter in a row and investing to grow both our traditional and new energy businesses. Earlier this week, we released our methane report with specific disclosures about our aim to be a leader in methane emissions management. Our goal is simple : keep methane in the pipe. I encourage you to read our report available on chevron.com. Our strategy remains clear and consistent. Our results keep getting better. While future market conditions are uncertain, we're well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. Third quarter financial results were strong. Included in the quarter were $177 million of pension settlement costs and positive foreign currency exchange effects of $624 million. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We repurchased shares at the high end of our guidance range and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio under 5%. Cash CapEx was $3 billion, up over 50% from last year. For the sixth consecutive quarter, Chevron's free cash flow exceeded $5 billion. We're on track to beat 2021's free cash flow record. Adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations partially offset by inventory timing impacts. In Other, tax benefits are more than offset by higher operating expenses and other costs. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and favorable inventory timing impacts. The planned turnaround at our Richmond refinery was a driver of higher OpEx and lower volumes for the period. In Other, lower chemicals earnings were partly offset by higher trading gains. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down modestly. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased primarily on higher liftings and tax benefits, partially offset by higher charges for abandonment accruals and exploration leases. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining margins and lower volumes and higher OpEx due to the Richmond planned turnaround. Partially offsetting is a favorable swing in timing effects. Third quarter oil equivalent production was flat compared to a year ago. Growth in the Permian, along with the absence of turnarounds and Hurricane Ida impacts were offset by the expiration of our contracts in Thailand and Indonesia and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.  Now looking ahead, in the fourth quarter, we expect modest turnaround. After producing a record number of LNG cargoes in third quarter, we expect fewer spot cargoes out of Australia due to maintenance and summer temperatures. In the third quarter, we received a dividend from Angola LNG. In the fourth quarter, we expect dividends from TCO and Angola LNG, and we expect to end 2022 at the top end of our full year guidance for affiliate dividends. As a reminder, Chevron pays a 15% withholding tax on TCO dividends that lowers earnings and cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we will pay over $700 million associated with the early termination of a long-term LNG regas contract at Sabine Pass. This payment was accrued previously through working capital. Also, we expect to buy back shares at the top end of our guidance range. In closing, the third quarter showed again how Chevron's higher returns, lower carbon objective creates value for all of our stakeholders. Back to you, Roderick. Roderick Green : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Sarah, please open the lines. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Perfect. Sorry about that. You think I'd have that right by now. Our first question is on U.S. production growth. So either Mike or Pierre, the Permian was relatively flat quarter over quarter, averaged a little under 700,000 a day so far this year. Given industry dynamics and supply chain challenges, can you provide an update on how operations are going? And I guess what we noticed is that with only 1 quarter left in the -- left for the year, it looks like you'll be closer to the lower end of the 700,000 to 750,000 guidance range. And so we're just wondering if that's by design or if there's external factors driving that because we also noticed this morning, one of your integrated peers in the Permian lowered their '22 growth expectations. Michael Wirth : Yes, Jeanine, my numbers say year-to-date, Permian production, a little over 700,000 barrels a day, up about 15% from first 3 quarters of last year, which was just a touch over 600. So we're seeing good growth. And for the quarter itself, production was up about 10% at 708,000 barrels a day versus 646 in the same quarter last year. I think the thing that some people may miss is during the pandemic, drilled but uncompleted well inventories really grew.  And rightfully so, we didn't need to frac wells and bring them online when there was declining demand for the production. So -- and we kept some drilling going. So that inventory grew. As we went back to work, the first thing we did was send completion crews out and start to bring the DUCs online. And you saw that through the back half of last year and certainly the first part of this year, which may have misled a little bit in terms of the rate of growth because this was this kind of surge capacity. We're back to [factory] (ph) drilling now. Our DUC inventory is kind of in line with what our plan would suggest it would be. And so we're seeing production level out at a growth rate that is more the kind of underlying rate that you should see. So we likely will be towards the lower end of the range. We get some non-ratable bookings from our non-operated joint ventures. We give you a range because we expect to be in the range, but we don't always hit the high end of the range. So in this case, we'll be towards the lower end. But we're not changing guidance for this year or our forward guidance. Pierre Breber : And Jeanine, I'll just add, that low end of the range, it represents 15% year-on-year growth. So that's very strong growth. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Agreed. Thank you for that clarification. Maybe, Pierre, just sticking with you here. In terms of your comments earlier this morning, I think I caught it in an article that '23 CapEx would be at the top end of the $15 million to $17 million medium-term guidance range. There's a lot of moving pieces, and I don't know if you're going to talk about this because you'll have to -- you'll release it in a month or so. But the most obvious moving pieces that we see next year are that TCO spend starting to roll off, and some of that will be absorbed by the Permian, which we know is going to garner some more capital next year. So our question is, is capital trending to the higher end of that range? Is that more a reflection of Chevron responding to the macro environment? Or was that always part of the plan? And maybe just some inflation is pushing the capital a little higher? Pierre Breber : It was always part of the plan for us to increase investment coming out of COVID, as Mike just spoke about. We're in the final stages of approving our business plan and our capital budget. And as you said, we'll announce that in December. You should expect it to be near the top end of the range, again, consistent with what our plans have been. We're going to increase in the Permian and in other locations. We do have some cost inflation that is also -- will contribute to that. We'll share all those details when we announce in December. And that's about a 20% increase in next year relative to where we think we'll end up this year. So year-to-date, we're a little bit below our capital budget on an organic basis. And so that will result in about a 20% increase, which is very, again, in line with our guidance and consistent with increasing investment and growing energy supplies. Operator : And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question was around Kazakhstan, and Mike, would just love your perspective on how you're viewing the assets out there, both the development of Tengiz? And then as you think through vacating barrels via the CPC pipeline? Michael Wirth : Sure. So I'll start with the project. We're on track to complete bulk construction by the end of this year. No change to our cost or schedule guidance, we're 97% complete on construction right now. There's still a lot of work to be done, but the risk and uncertainty are certainly narrowing and the remaining risks tend to be smaller in scale and potential impact. So we're moving into commissioning systems testing and start-up activities. We built a new integrated operations control center that I visited, which is fully operational with systems online. Our drilling program is complete. The final metering station is online. So very good progress on the construction side, and we'll continue to update you as we progress toward WPMP, the pressure management startup indicated right now for second half of '23 and then the future growth project in '24. On the CPC and the pipeline, there are no constraints on our ability to move barrels on that line. We've flowed everything out that we've been producing. And you've probably seen the media reports that a couple of the single-point moorings are offline right now for some repairs. So the buoyancy system, those repairs are underway and expected to be completed shortly. So at this point, everything flowing and it looks like we'll continue to do so. Neil Mehta : And Mike, you spent many years as a down-streamer as well and have great perspective on the global refining system. I don't think I ever thought that the cracks would be up here. So just love your perspective of where we are in terms of the refining market, how do we work our way through the bottlenecks that seem to be existing in the system and what that means for your Downstream business? Michael Wirth : Sure. It's been an interesting couple of years in the refining sector, Neil. With COVID, we actually saw through that period of time, some refineries shut down around the world that maybe at a rate greater than we would have expected before as the economics really collapsed, as demand collapsed. There were -- been some refineries in the U.S. that have been taken offline after storm damage or operating incidents that are not coming back. We see others being converted to renewable diesel. And so you had a constraint or a reduction in refining capacity that occurred over the last couple of years in a way we really haven't seen previously. And the other thing that happened is some of the new builds that are in various stages of development, primarily in the Middle East or Asia, slowed down during COVID. And a lot of the industry slowed activity until we had a better view on how we were going to come through that period of time. I think those will come back into developments and eventually online which will ease some of these global constraints. But the system is tight right now. And what you see is when you have some maintenance that runs along, some unplanned events, as we've seen on the West Coast, or when you see things like the strike that we've seen in France here recently, markets tighten up really quickly. And that sends a price signal to try to bring supplies in from further away. And so the entire refining complex right now is a little more tightly balanced than it historically has been. And I think in the short term, if you want to call that the next year, plus or minus, probably stays that way, maybe a little bit longer to some degree. And then I think as you see some of this new capacity come online, we get back into a situation where it's not quite as finely balanced as it is today. But to no doubt, we're in a market that we really haven't seen probably in my career in terms of the overall tightness on supply and demand. Operator : And our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Just thinking about your buyback range, $5 billion to $15 billion. 3Q is a strong quarter from a fundamental perspective, but maybe feels more repeatable to me than as an upside case than 2Q did. In 3Q, you still generated free cash flow well in excess of both your dividend and the buyback at the top end of the range. So my question is do you think you could go further than the $15 billion at the top end, given you still have a good amount of deleveraging happening at this point in the cycle, it doesn't seem quite as extraordinary as 2Q did. Michael Wirth : Yes. John, we've actually increased our rate of buybacks 3 times this year. We announced the first one at the end of last year. So we've steadily moved the range up and the rate of repurchases up. And so we're at an all-time high in terms of the rate of share repurchases. And you're right. We've got strong cash flow right now, which allows us to support all of our financial priorities and maintain the strong balance sheet. I think the thing that I just would reemphasize is we want to maintain the buyback program throughout the cycle. And we're not procyclical. We're not countercyclical. We want to operate across the cycle so that our shareholders see consistency out of us and know that they can count on that. And so we're positioned in a way where we're confident we can maintain that. And we regularly reassess it as our view on our business and commodity markets continues to evolve. And so we'll continue to do that and apprise you of anything further. Pierre, do you want to add anything to that? Pierre Breber : I'll just point out that we increased our dividend 6% earlier this year. We've been growing our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 6% for 15 years. And that is our first financial priority. So there's a lot of tension on the buyback, but it's clearly our fourth priority after sustaining and growing the dividend, investing to grow both traditional and new energy businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet. And as Mike said, we intend to do it across the cycle for multiple years. John Royall : Great. And then just looking at your bridge for international upstream, and I think Pierre may have mentioned in his remarks as well. You have this tailwind about $300 million from tax. Is that an impact from country mix? Or are there other moving pieces we should think about there? And should we think about this as sustainable? Pierre Breber : In terms of international upstream, the benefit in the third quarter was primarily around a record LNG cargoes out of Australia, primarily Gorgon and Wheatstone are very happy to see that. It was a time when the world needed the energy. And again, a lot of that is under long-term contracts, but that included cargoes in the spot market, which we know we're at high prices. So we signaled that we expect of fewer LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter because during the summer temperatures in the southern hemisphere is just how -- you just produce less. And then we do have a pit stop that is planned for 1 of our facilities. In terms of tax items, those are items that can be onetime in nature. And so I would not look for those to be necessarily repeating. Operator : Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Maybe just to ask a question that kind of ties a little bit into the question on the Permian. Maybe as you said, lower end in the non-op portion and the CapEx discussion. But just a broad question on inflation and not just inflation in the price sense, but some of the productivity challenges that come when you start getting busier. I mean you've got as good a global footprint as anybody. I'm just curious how you'd characterize that as you look across? And is there -- is it becoming more challenging to mitigate some of those issues? Michael Wirth : Yes. Roger, the -- I'd like to tell people we plan our work and work our plan. And so we've indicated for -- frankly, if you go back to pre COVID, our trajectory is that we pretty much have stayed right on even with the interruption of COVID. And so in terms of contracting for rigs, completion crews, pipe, sand, you name it, we tend to have a longer-term visibility into that. We commit to our service providers earlier, and that can result in both quality and availability of people, equipment, et cetera. So we don't see any meaningful constraints on our ability to execute our program. Certainly, we are seeing some cost inflation. And the Permian is probably the strongest that we see around the world, kind of into the low double digits year-on-year. In other parts of our portfolio, the cost pressures are probably a little bit less and the constraints aren't quite as pressing. So I think you'll see a little bit of that in our capital guidance as it comes out as we wrap up our planning and we look to next year. And I do think that it is probably a very real, I don't want to call it a governor, but a constraint on industry, the pace of industry activity and ramp up as we get into the next year. You'll hear other people talking about it from their point of view, and I'll let them comment, but yes, it's very real. And we've seen this movie before. In the Permian, we've seen it up in the oil sands a decade earlier. And in a cyclical business, this is a part of it. Roger Read : Yes, for sure. Follow-up question. Renewable natural gas RNG, we saw big acquisition announced here a few weeks ago on that front. You've been one of the leaders. And I was just curious, as you look at what's been going on in terms of some of the legislation that's come out federally as well as just the extent of the impact of the LCFS in California. Any updates we should think about in the RNG business. One of the things mentioned in that acquisition was the position that company already had in terms of -- I guess you'd call it leaseholds, right, on landfills and stuff and just characterize kind of where you are relative to where you want to be and to where maybe this competitor is setting up. Michael Wirth : Sure. We feel very good about where we are. We're a leader in RNG, leveraging strengths across the entire value chain, from feedstock to customer. We've been a partner of choice for a lot of the dairy farmers. We've got a strong brand to pull through. We've got a really strong market position in California where the LCFS provides the strongest incentives for this. So we like the position that we've built up. We've got 75 CNG sites online are in progress right now through the retail side. So our efforts, we were an early mover and we've preferentially focused on dairy as opposed to landfill gas. So there certainly are others that are active in this area. I don't want to comment on how somebody else looks at things. I would just say, our business is up and running, and we're supplying customers today, not kind of planning out into the future and kind of banking on that. I mean we intend to grow it further, but it's a real business for us today and it's performing well. Operator : Our next question will come from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So I wanted to stick with New Energies first. And a few weeks ago, there was an announcement that you joined a consortium to look at a hydrogen and ammonia project in the Gulf Coast. So I was wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail around that. And then more broadly, with the Inflation Reduction Act passage, how you're thinking about the opportunity set in your New Energies platform over the next few years? Michael Wirth : Sure. So we're excited about the announcements to work with a number of really good partners to try to develop hydrogen opportunities there on the Gulf Coast. One of the things I think you're going to see in these New Energies businesses as they evolve is we're going to have to build entire new value chains. And that means we're going to partner with different people who have expertise in different parts of these value chains and can bring technology, can bring customers, can bring experience to a venture that no one company necessarily would have all of that, but collectively, we can work with people that can build these new value chains. And so it's early days on many of these things, we're studying all the different opportunities in terms of blue hydrogen, green hydrogen, there's a lot of different colors that are possible as you get down into the details of it. And it will require significant investments. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. This is to really develop well-informed perspectives on the investment opportunities, the business models and ultimately, how we would build the business up there. But it's exciting. They're high-quality partners that we are working with. And I think you'll see more of these efforts announced here. We've got a lot of it that we're working on around the world, not just here in the U.S. Devin McDermott : Great. Look forward to seeing the additional details there over time. My second question is actually on M&A and just consolidation. And if you think back over the last few years, you've had a great track record, the Noble deal in 2020 REGI more recently. Wonder if you could talk a little bit more about how you're viewing the landscape for further acquisitions, upstream, downstream and even New Energies going forward. Michael Wirth : Sure, Devin. So we're always looking. We've got an evergreen process where we scan all the different sectors that are of interest to us. And so we watch companies, we watch sectors, we watch opportunities. Although we've had a pretty high bar, which is why we've only done a few deals. And as you say, we feel like the deals we've done are likely to turn out well. We've got a strong portfolio. We've got a really strong base case. And so we don't need to do a deal unless it really improves on what we expect to deliver otherwise. So I would just say we're going to continue to be very disciplined. We don't have an open checkbook even when times are good like this, especially when times are good like this. We walked away from a deal a few years ago rather than chase value out of it. We've sold assets out of our portfolio at well times. And as you say, the last couple of deals were done at a pretty good time. So over time, I think in the oil and gas business, there's likely to be some more consolidation. You need fewer and stronger companies that normally happens at the bottom of the cycle rather than at the top of the cycle. In New Energies, there's a lot of activity, to Devin's question, and I think there's a very active market out there where you could see some things come together because nobody has all the pieces. And I think as you look at building these businesses, we're going to find combinations probably are necessary to actually begin to put those pieces together. But we're going to be disciplined as we have been all along. And if we do anything, we'll come out to explain to you how it's going to create value for shareholders. Operator : Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Mike or Pierre, maybe I've got one for each of you guys, and I'll go to Pierre first. So Pierre, I think you've been -- both of you guys have been very clear about managing the buyback through the cycle. And I think we all probably agree that your breakeven is not one of the best in the industry. But you still end up building a ton of cash and your share price is at, I guess, pretty close to an all-time high. So I'm just curious, the last thing you had this situation, you had multiple parallel projects going on to manage almost close to a net debt 0 balance sheet. What's to prevent you from building cash on the balance sheet and being opportunistic, whether it be through M&A or whether it be a cyclical opportunity to buy back your shares at a low level? I'm just curious how you think about that. Pierre Breber : We've had a philosophy that goes back a long time and a track record. Again, I think that speaks for itself, 35 years of dividend increases, again, compounding at 6% for the last 15 years. Our investments in our traditional new energy growing both our guidance on upstream production growth is 3% compounded. We're now the second largest bio-renewable diesel producer in the country with our REGI acquisition. And when we generate cash in excess of that, it first goes to the balance sheet. So we've been very clear that our stated net debt ratio is between 20% to 25%. That's still a very strong balance sheet. If you recall, as we entered COVID, we were the only company that showed a stress test at $30 Brent and our net debt ratio was going to go into the low 30s if in fact, we would have had 2 years at 30. But that would have been where many of our peers started into COVID. So we've always maintained a strong balance sheet, and we think that's appropriate over the cycle to be in that range. But we're well below that. Our net debt is under 5%. So that's just a function of cash coming in and our just commitment to not be procyclical, we could have a larger buyback program today. Absolutely, if we wanted to just peg our net debt ratio at a higher level. But I think our shareholders would appropriately question that strategy as not being across the cycle. So we're setting the buyback at a level that allows us to maintain it across the cycle when prices do correct. We'll continue to buy back shares near the top end of the range that we've been talking about. In terms of acting countercyclically, in terms of M&A or any kind of major capital project, we have the capacity to do that at all kinds of balance sheets. We've shown that on M&A, we use equity because we think it makes a lot of sense. There's oil price risk in any kind of transaction so we don't need to do it all with cash. It will come with debt very likely. So we want to have some capacity but using equity in oil deals makes a lot of sense. And again, we have a great portfolio of projects, but we've shown a 10-year profile in addition to our 5-year guidance where the growth continues. We have a lot of great projects to choose from. The goal here is to sustain and grow the enterprise with the lowest capital possible. We're more capital and cost efficient than we've ever been. We've talked about that. And we're not really paid for growth by the market. So we're growing at very appropriate rates, strong rates for the next 5 years. And again, we've shown beyond that, but we certainly have the balance sheet and the capability to do more if we think, again, as Mike said, it's in the interest of our shareholders. Doug Leggate : Mike, I hate to put you in the spot, but you have the privilege or the challenge, I guess, of meeting with administration recently. I asked this question to your larger peer earlier today. And I'm just curious if you would care to share your thoughts on some of the potential legislative risks that might face the industry. And I guess, at a big picture level, I'm curious whether if you feel that the kind of ESG pendulum from an investor standpoint is beginning to swing back in your favor? Just that any thoughts you may care to share on that. Michael Wirth : Sure, Doug. So look, when we meet with policymakers, including those in the administration, what I talk about is the importance in energy of balancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection. And all 3 of those things matter. Economic prosperity is affordable energy underpins the ability of the economics or economies to thrive. Reliable energy is tied to national security, and we're seeing that play out in different parts of the world today. And then, of course, there are the concerns about the environmental impacts of energy production and energy use, and we have to take those very seriously as well. And so my message to the policymakers is to be sure that we consider the appropriate balance of all 3 of those in policy because if you over-index on just one, you can create unintended consequences and vulnerabilities that may not manifest themselves for a little while, but they're there. And eventually, they do materialize. And so I'm a believer that we share a lot of common ground with governments around the world as we talk about these issues. We share common ground with our investors who are concerned about these things as well. And so look, we've been doing ESG for a long time. I keep a book on my desk called the Standard Oil Spirit that was written in 1923. And it talks about our commitment to people, it talks about our commitment to protecting the environment. And this has been in the ethos of the company forever, and it's evolved as society has evolved. And so we're committed to being a responsible company and being a part of the solution here in the U.S. and around the world. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe one follow-up question on biofuels, on the liquid side of the biofuels market. Could you maybe provide an update how you're seeing the liquid biofuels market maybe relative to your expectations, particularly with a little time with the REG acquisition under your belt? You're expanding pretreatment in Germany, Europe pitching things towards sustainable aviation fuel. So how is the market playing out relative to your expectations? How do you see the past issue playing out between U.S. and Europe? And then maybe any update on the progress of the Geismar renewable diesel facility that you acquired from REG? Michael Wirth : Sure. So I'll start with the REG acquisition. The assets are good, the people are little better. Any surprises so far have been to the upside. We've already identified quick wins, commercial opportunities. We've lowered insurance and financing costs. Integration efforts are all on track and delivering on our expectations. We're seeing placement of biodiesel in the Chevron's West Coast refining or in the marketing network, and that continues to ramp up. We're optimizing freight and feedstocks across the system. So all of that builds on the strength that both companies had in the renewable fuels value chain. And we just see it as really a nice combination here. The Geismar expansion is underway, and we're halfway already to our renewable fuels target as that's completed. We indicated we're going to grow to 100,000 barrels a day. We're well on our way to do that. And of course, we're investing in other relationships. We've got a joint venture with Bunge, where we're now participating in the soybean crush spread and bringing feedstocks into the system. We're working on converting hydro processing capacity at some of our refineries to be able to run bio feedstocks. So this is a part of our business that will grow the economics on it, like anything in the downstream or a function of feedstock costs, supply demand in markets. But they've been good so far, and we expect across the cycle and out into time that they're going to continue to be an important part of our portfolio. We are seeing more people go into renewable diesel. It's a market that, like any other commodity market at times may get long and margins may reflect that. But we're familiar with those dynamics from our traditional business. Ryan Todd : Thanks, Mike. Maybe one more. Just maybe a little speculative, but any thoughts on what you think the impact of a Russian product import ban to Europe on how that could play out in terms of product flows? Are those barrels likely to find a home in Latin America or Africa? Or do you think that we may actually see a decent amount of that Russian product disappear from the market? Michael Wirth : Yes. Any of these export bans have to be looked at within the context of the broader market. And as you say, just as we've seen on crude, where the U.S. has managed the import of Russian crude Europe hasn't yet that's coming. And -- but it's a global market. And you've got other buyers that need -- they need the products and they're not participating in the sanctions necessarily. And so going to the earlier question from Neil about the products side of the business, markets are tight right now. Diesel, in particular, as we've seen here recently and likely to stay that way through the winter, I think. Further, we get into the first quarter when the products ban comes into effect in Europe. And I think that's going to be set against a backdrop of pretty tight product markets, and you are going to find countries around the world need that fuel. And you get into logistics then, you've got longer shipping legs, which do you have enough ships to move it and how do you -- how does the system reoptimize? It's a less efficient optimization for sure than moving it to the natural closer markets. But I do think that you'll see those products continue to flow although just go to more distant markets with increased costs and logistics and continue to keep some of this pressure on the overall balances out there. Operator : Our next question will come from Lucas Herrmann with Exane. Lucas Herrmann : Two, if I might. The first for you, Pierre. Just remind me, in terms of the associate contribution towards the top end of the range, I think the indication was $3 billion at the top end of the range, but perhaps you could give us an indication of the level of dividend that's been paid out to associate to date. And I guess I'm a little surprised that in the current environment, one might expect that the associate dividend would be beyond the $3 billion? And then, Mike, just if you could just give us a whirlwind tour or it's not whirlwind, but just talk around the Gulf the developments that are taking place there within your own portfolio and how those are proceeding and your current thoughts on timing. That'd be great. Michael Wirth : Okay. I'll let Pierre start, and then when I come back, I'll just ask you to clarify, Gulf of Mexico or... Lucas Herrmann : Sorry, Gulf of Mexico. Yes, no, Gulf of Mexico. Michael Wirth : Okay. Very good. Lucas Herrmann : You're welcome to talk about both, Mike. Pierre Breber : Lucas, you're right that affiliate dividends at last quarter, we guided to be above the top end of the range, and now we're guiding at the top end of the range, which we increased during the course of the year. And that reflects really 2 items. Angola LNG has in the affiliate income line, been generating earnings all year, but during the first half of the year, the cash return was a return to capital and the dividend. And so it's showing up in a different part of the cash flow statement. And then the second item is, given the uncertainty at CPC, TCO is holding more cash. We'll get more cash out of TCO. But I think TCO appropriately is just being cautious. As Mike said, all of our barrels are flowing. In October, we expect them all to flow. In November, we expect the repairs to be completed shortly. That said, they're just being cautious and holding a little higher cash balances. So we'll be at the top end of the range through 3Q, I think we're at about $2 billion of affiliate dividends. You can confirm that with Roderick. But the reason why you're seeing that the cash flow line of affiliate income less dividends being a little bit larger than maybe you'd expect, it's primarily those 2 drivers in terms of the quirks of Angola LNG accounting and TCO holding cash balances, which will be a temporary thing, and we expect that, that we'll see higher cash in the future from them. Michael Wirth : Okay. Gulf of Mexico, Lucas, as you know, we're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf. We've got over 270 leases out there and a strong base business, a lot of installed infrastructure that enables capital-efficient brownfield development. And importantly, it's one of the most carbon-efficient assets in our portfolio with a carbon intensity of about 6 kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent. Lease Sale 257 is the one that was in question. Here a few months ago, as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, that's been clarified and that lease sale is proceeding. We picked up 34 leases in that sale. And we look forward to continued leasing by the federal government as indicated and kind of encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act, and we'll participate in those. In terms of production growth, we will advance a number of projects that are underway right now. Jack St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that starts up this year and some additional development drilling. Bigfoot has ongoing development drilling and water injection that will begin in the first quarter of next year. Mad Dog 2 is operated by one of our partners, and I would refer you to them for an update on that project. We've got at St. Malo, our waterflood first injection plan for next year. Anchor a new greenfield project. We expect first oil on that in 2024. Whale, another greenfield project operated by one of our partners. I expect first oil on that towards the end of 2024. And then we recently took FID in the second quarter of this year on the Ballymore project and expect first oil on that one in 2025. So I appreciate the question because oftentimes, I hear people say, well, we can see the Kazakhstan growth. We can see the Permian. What else do you have? We've got a string of projects there in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico that are kind of sequentially lined out that will steadily contribute to production growth here in the U.S. from the deepwater. Operator : And our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : I've got two left, please. First one is just going back to Kazakhstan and CPC. My understanding is there's been sort of fortuitous timing for Tengiz because one of the other projects in Kazakhstan has been offline, which has allowed Tengiz to flow despite the capacity obviously being lower. So I was just trying to understand, hypothetically, if Kazakh production comes back up to full capacity, but the pipeline capacity is maintained to be reduced or is not at full capacity? Then do all the projects get pro rata down equally? Or is there any other quirks that we need to be aware of there as it relates to Tengiz? And then the second question is on your LNG portfolio, performed extremely strong this quarter. Can you say what proportion of your LNG portfolio is sold under long-term contracts? And what portion is sold on a spot basis, either for the year or over the medium term? Michael Wirth : Yes. So at CPC, I mentioned earlier that right now, only 1 of the 3 single point moorings is operational. The other 2 are down for some maintenance and repair work that's well underway. And so we would expect that work to be completed and to be able to handle full flows on CPC here before too long. If for some reason that didn't happen, and we were constrained to the 1 SPM, that has the capacity to load out about 70% of what CPC can move when it's operating full. So there would be some constraints on movements. TCO has long been the initial, the largest and in many ways I think the most important shipper on that line and that's reflected in some of the practices that I don't want to get into the details, but we would still be able to flow barrels, maybe not all of our barrels, but I think TCO would be well positioned to not be disadvantaged, let me say that, if there were some sort of proration underway. Pierre Breber : I'll just add that the nominations for CPC for November have already been put in place and Tengiz TCO essentially got a full nomination even for November. And again, that's even in a situation if the SPMs are not repaired. Of course, if they're repaired by then, fine issue, but even if they stay down for November, TCO has already received a full nomination. On the LNG question Biraj, it's notionally around 80% contracted, 20% spot. That's a combination of both of our Australia LNG operations and our West Africa operations. Our West Africa tends to be almost all spot and Australia is closer to 90-10. So that averages out to about 80-20. And we'll give guidance on our spot price sensitivity. We'll do that in the fourth quarter call at the end of January. It depends on how many spot cargoes are produced, both out of, again, our West Africa and Australia operations. Operator : And our next question will come from Irene Himona with SocGen. Irene Himona : Congratulations on the very strong results. My first question, your financial framework is clearly to manage through the cycle. But at the same time, the current uncertainty on the commodity price outlook is rather extreme, and that is partly because of the risks or fears of a recession. So my question is, as you look at your Downstream businesses, whether in the U.S. or Asia, have you seen any signs of an economic slowdown which would cause you some concern as you look ahead to 2023 and which might perhaps drive a more conservative approach to CapEx growth? Michael Wirth : Yes, Irene, thanks. Demand remains pretty strong globally across the product. Now there are some variations in that. Certainly, the U.S. West Coast, which had some refining issues and prices reflected that. We saw gasoline demand in the third quarter, responsive to those higher prices and a little bit of softness there. Diesel demand has been pretty strong around the world, maybe a little less so in China, given some of the lockdowns that they're seeing. And aviation demand has been steadily coming back as people are flying again not quite to pre-COVID levels yet, but steadily increasing. And so overall, I wouldn't say that product demand that we've seen to date is sending a strong signal that a recession is underway or that the economy is significantly slowing. As I said, there's always some kind of regional or maybe sectoral unique characteristics. But no, we're not really seeing that yet, Irene. Irene Himona : My supplementary question, if I can go back to renewable natural gas, please. LCSS prices have more or less halved over the last year. I wonder if you can help us understand the impact, if any, on your own R&D. Does it create some pressures to perhaps work more on the technology to try and reduce the costs, given that the value of the incentive is half what it was last year? Michael Wirth : Sure. So let me set the incentive aside for a second. In every one of our Downstream businesses, we're always working on reducing costs and improving technology and finding ways to become more efficient. And so that's inherent in our business. The dynamics around LCFS credits, RINs, AB32 credits in California, the EU trading scheme. All of these things, we have to manage through their own cycles. And it's a part of our business that is related to but not necessarily correlated to the fundamental supply-demand dynamics that drive physical flows because you have government allocations of credits and whether people are building inventories or credits or drawing down inventories of these credits. And so they don't necessarily correlate with the underlying commodity. And we've got a fair amount of experience in managing that. Certainly, the economics on something like RNG rely on the credit structure and the regulatory framework that incentivized those businesses. And if you see the credits declining in value that it starts to erode a little bit of the margin in that business. We have to take a long-term view on these things. And I think the regulators do the same. And as they see credit values reflect a lot of length in credits, that suggests that the technology is advancing, the supply is advancing and they can set more ambitious targets. And so these things evolve over time. And I think our people have a pretty good track record of managing in that environment. Operator : And our last question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Mike and Pierre, one question for each. First is a simple one. In the past in your presentation, when you're talking about Downstream, we talk about what's the chemical earning sequentially, whether they are up or down. You didn't mention in your presentation at this time. Does that means that chemical earnings is actually relatively flat, which is surprising given how much is the margin drop we've seen in the industry. So that's the first question. Second question on Mike, is for the LNG longer-term strategy. most of your peers that have been pretty aggressive in growing their LNG operation, you have very possible or at least very cash flow rich LNG operation, but you don't really have much time to grow at least on the table. Can you maybe elaborate that what is your longer-term -- medium- to longer-term strategy in LNG. Michael Wirth : Sure, Paul. Yes, quickly on chemicals, earnings were a little bit lower quarter-on-quarter. And that's really a function of margins. We had higher ethane prices and lower polyethylene prices. And so the olefins margins, which is the largest driver of our performance were squeezed. So it did go down sequentially. On LNG strategy, we've long favored the Pacific Basin, given the best customers were in Japan, Korea, Taiwan markets and our resource position in the Pacific. The Atlantic Basin, we've got exposure to it. But Europe traditionally has been a market where you were competing with Russian pipe gas and just less attractive. With the changes now that we see in markets, we're increasing exposure to Atlantic Basin LNG. We've done a couple of deals with Gulf Coast projects that are being developed that will give us offtake that we can move into global markets. And then we're advancing projects in the Eastern Mediterranean and the assets that were acquired with the Noble acquisition, that would potentially allow an expansion of the Leviathan field to provide LNG supply that can go into global markets. We've looked at other things. So the big process has been underway in cutter. We certainly were deeply involved in evaluating that opportunity. Like everything that we look at, LNG has to compete against the other investment opportunities in our portfolio. We're going to stay very disciplined on capital and we won't invest in everything that we could. We're going to invest in the best things that we can. And I expect that will include some LNG projects over time. Roderick Green : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call today. Please stay safe and healthy. Sarah, back to you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please, go ahead. Roderick Green : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. Also listening in today is Jake Spiering, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations, who will assume this position effective March 1. Jake and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of months. It's been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last two years. Thank you for your questions, feedback and investment in Chevron. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide two. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Wirth : Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron had an outstanding year in 2022, delivering record financial performance, producing more traditional energy and advancing lower carbon businesses. Free cash flow set a record, beating our previous high in 2021 by more than $15 billion, enabling a strong dividend increase and the buyback of almost 4% of our shares. US production was also our highest ever, led by double-digit growth in the Permian. Growth matters when it's profitable. Return on capital employed over 20% shows that our focus on capital efficiency is delivering results. And we took important steps in building new energy businesses. We successfully integrated REG's people and assets into Chevron, combining the best of both companies' technical and commercial capabilities. And we acquired rights to pore space for potential carbon capture and storage projects in Texas and Australia. We had many other highlights last year, to name just a few, at TCO, project construction is largely complete, and we're starting up the fuel gas system. Focus is on commissioning and start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project by the end of this year, to begin transition of the field from high to low pressure. We announced a significant new gas discovery offshore Egypt, which could build on our growing natural gas position in the Eastern Med. And our affiliate CPChem reached FID for two world-scale ethylene and derivative projects in Texas and Qatar. 2022 was a dynamic year, with unique macroeconomic and geopolitical forces disrupting economies and industries around the globe. These events remind us of the importance of affordable and reliable energy with a lower carbon intensity over time. We don't know what's ahead in 2023. I do know that Chevron's approach will be clear and consistent, focused on capital, cost and operational discipline, with the objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $6.4 billion or $3.33 per share. Adjusted earnings were $7.9 billion or $4.09 per share. Included in the quarter were $1.1 billion in write-offs and impairments in our international upstream segment, and negative foreign currency effects over $400 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Record operating cash flows in combination with continued capital efficiency, resulted in over $37 billion of free cash flow in 2022. The only other year Chevron's operating cash flow exceeded $40 billion was 2011. Free cash flow in that year was less than 40% and of this year's record. In 2022, Chevron delivered outstanding results on all four of its financial priorities. Announcing earlier this week another 6% increase in our dividend per share, positioning 2023 to be the 36th consecutive year with annual dividend payout increases, investing within its organic budget despite cost inflation. Inorganic CapEx totaled $1.3 billion nearly 80% for new energy investments. Paying down debt in every quarter and ending the year with a 3% net debt ratio, returning record annual cash to shareholders through buybacks and exiting the year with an annual repurchase rate of $15 billion. Two days ago, Chevron's Board of Directors authorized a new $75 billion share repurchase program. Now is a good time to look back on our execution of the prior programs. Over the past nearly two decades, we bought back shares in more than three out of every four years, returning more than $65 billion to shareholders. And we've done it below the market average price during the whole time period. Going forward with the new program, our intent is the same, be a steady buyer of our shares across commodity cycles. With a breakeven Brent price around $50 per barrel to cover our CapEx and dividend and with excess balance sheet capacity, we're positioned to return more cash to shareholders in any reasonable oil price scenario. Turning to the quarter. Adjusted earnings were down nearly $3 billion compared with last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower realizations and liftings as well as higher exploration expense, partially offset by favorable timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining and chemicals margins and negative timing effects partially offset with higher sales volumes following third quarter turnarounds. The Other segment charges increased mainly due to accruals for stock-based compensation. For the full year, adjusted earnings increased more than $20 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings were up primarily due to increased realizations. Other items include higher exploration expenses, higher incremental royalties and production taxes due to higher prices, partially offset by favorable tax benefits and other items. Downstream adjusted earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower chemical earnings and higher maintenance and turnaround costs. 2022 production was in line with guidance after adjusting for higher prices. As a reminder, Chevron's share of production is lower under certain international contracts when actual prices are higher than assumed in our guidance. Reserves replacement ratio was nearly 100% with the largest net additions in the Permian, Israel, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Higher prices lowered our share of proved reserves by over 100 million barrels of oil equivalent. 2023 production is expected to be flat to up 3% at $80 Brent. After adjusting for lower prices and portfolio changes, primarily the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and the expiration of a contract in Thailand, we expect production to grow led by the Permian and other shale and tight assets. We remain confident in exceeding our long-term production guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, I'll call out a few items. Earnings estimates from first quarter refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo. Based on the current outlook, we expect higher natural gas costs for our California refineries. Full year guidance for all other segment losses is lower this year due to higher expected interest income and again excludes special items such as pension settlement costs. The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We estimate annual affiliate dividends between $5 billion and $6 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. The difference between affiliate earnings and dividends is expected to be less than $2 billion. We do not expect a dividend from TCO in the first quarter. We updated our earnings sensitivities. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG sales. Also, we expect to maintain share buybacks at the top end of our guidance range during the first quarter. Finally, as a reminder in Venezuela, we use cost affiliate accounting, which means we will only record earnings, if we receive cash. We do not record production or reserves. 2022 was a record year for Chevron in many ways. We look forward to the future, confident in our strategy with a consistent objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day next month. Back to you, Roderick. Roderick Green : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Mike Wirth : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Before we get started \u2013 hi, good morning, Mike. We'd like to wish Roderick well in his new position, and we really appreciate all your time and help over the past two years. So thank you very much. Our first question, maybe just heading towards the buyback authorization topic. This week, the Board authorized the buyback authorization up to $75 billion, no expiration date, which is pretty large versus the prior authorization that had a four-year expiration date. We heard your comments on wanting to be a steady buyer of your shares across cycles and that you're positioned to return more cash to shareholders. Can you comment on the decision-making process for getting to that $75 billion and maybe the choice to leave the authorization open in timing versus the prior authorization did have an expiration date? Mike Wirth : Yeah, Jeanine, let me start, and then I'll have Pierre add a little bit of color. We included a little information on this call looking back at our past programs. And as you saw on the slide 15 of the last 19 years, we've bought shares back lower than the market volume weighted average over that period of time. We look at the decision going forward in the context of the cash-generating potential of the portfolio, the outlook for the market environment, the strength of the balance sheet. And we don't want to be authorizing a program every year. So, we talk to the Board about a multiyear outlook. So, the fact that there's not an end date on it is only significant if you're trying to do some sort of math and annualize this. We think our track record speaks for ourselves and the steady, consistent way that we've done this. And so, we increased the rate three times last year as we saw the situation evolve, and we're now at an all-time high with the rate of repurchases. So, the last thing you said it, but I'll repeat it, is sized to maintain our program through the commodity cycle. We aren't pro-cyclical. We're not countercyclical. We're steady through the cycle, and that is the intention. Pierre, do you want to add anything? Pierre Breber : Yes, Jeanine. So, the authorization from 2019 was going to be consumed in the second quarter. It was also open. So, it did not have a defined time period. We just -- will have consumed it. So, instead of having an authorization in the middle of the quarter, we'll complete this quarter's buybacks under the 2019 authorization, which again had an open time period, and then we'll start the new on April 1st. So, it is similar the way it was done in the prior time. Jeanine Wai : Thank you for that clarification. We appreciate that. Maybe our second question, it's that time of year again, reserve replacement ratio, your ratio for 2022 was 97%. And we believe that compared to 112% last year, and then I think it was around 99% on average for the five years before that. So, our question for you is just -- how do you see this ratio trending over time? And I guess the over or under bogey is probably 100%. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yes. So, it can move in any given year, Jeanine for a whole host of reasons, right? Prices, FID decisions, portfolio actions that we take to either sell or buy. And so, the one-year number is one that will move around. The longer cycle numbers, the one that you ought to pay attention to. Remember also, as we have this large position in the Permian we continue to develop. We can only book five years forward. And so, each year, we'll produce out of the unconventional assets, and we'll add another year's worth of reserves on the back end of that. And so, if you were to look at the Permian unconstrained by that, you'd have a very different view. This year, we had some additions in the Permian and Israel and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as Pierre mentioned, the largest net reduction this year were Kazakhstan due to the contract terms and the effect of higher prices. If you were to actually adjust that out, so we mentioned 100 million barrels where the price effect this year would be -- think of it as 107% ex the price effect. And so, I do think over time, we intend to be in this business for quite a while and 100% is a number that you ought to expect to see that or greater over time. But in any given year or any short number of years, you might see something looks a little bit different. Operator : We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, Roderick, I wanted to echo Jeanine\u2019s congrats on the new role and thank you for all the help over the years and great working with you. So I wanted to focus in on upstream. And it's good to see the continued progress on TCO and exciting to be getting close to the finish line on the expansion project there. You noted that WPMP is on track for commissioning and start-up later this year. I just wanted to first confirm that the second part of that expansion, FGP is still on track for '24. And then just stepping back, could you just walk us through your latest expectations to the impacts on both TCO production, CapEx and then also affiliate dividends as these projects come online. Trying to get a sense of the changes in '24 versus '23? And then also, how you think about the run rate on both volumes and spending for that affiliate post FGP. Mike Wirth : Yes. Devin, I'll talk to the project and let Pierre talk a little bit to the financials. First of all, no change to cost or schedule guidance. WPMP is trending toward a beginning start-up by the end of this year. We've got a lot of work done. We've got a new power grid up and running and this was a power grid built back in the Soviet days. The control room is up and running, where everything comes into one central control room. All the production on gas injection wells are done, the gas injection facility is now in early commissioning. In just the next few days, we'll tie in the fuel gas system to the first gas turbine generator, which is really an important milestone to test the first of the three GTGs, begin the process of powering up electrical generation capacity and commissioning boilers, steam and other utilities. So, that all happens sequentially here over the next period of time, which leads to commissioning the pressure boost compressors in the third quarter and then converting the field from beginning the conversion from high to low pressure by the end of the year. A couple of things that will bear on production. We've got two planned turnarounds of the old processing trains. They're called the KTL. There's five of them. We had two turnarounds this year that are planned in the third quarter. So those will be down for a period of time. And then as those come back up, production may not fully recover on those two as some of the wells won't resume flowing until we get to the low-pressure system. So, back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of that impact. And then as we move into '24, we've got more of these high pressure to low-pressure conversions in the field and we've got FGP start-up first half of '24. So you don't see the full effect of FGP roll through, you get partial effect in ramping in '24, and then the full effect will show in '25. Cash will kind of follow that pattern. So Pierre, maybe you can talk about the pattern on CapEx and dividends. Pierre Breber : Yes. For 2023, the TCO dividends are included in the guidance we provided, $5 billion, $6 billion, which is up from what our total dividends that we received last year. We did indicate that TCO has held a little excess cash during the course of last year just due to uncertainties that are going on right now. The CapEx was included in our December release. So it's nearly half of the $3 billion of -- affiliate CapEx, so that\u2019s $1.5 billion. Again, you would expect that to continue to roll off next year. And then if you go back to our Investor Day, we showed that at $60 Brent post start-up in a full year of FGP production, that the free cash flow coming out of TCO on 100% basis would be $10 billion. And again, that's a $60 Brent. We'll provide further updates as we normally do on Investor Day. But the takeaway, as we've said for a long time, now we've been investing in this project for six plus years through COVID, through the ups and downs, when it starts up, it will generate a lot of free cash flow. We'll see that in the form of dividends, and we'll see that in the form of paying back some of the loans that we co-lend into TCO. Mike Wirth : Devin, just to kind of put a final punctuation on that. In our Investor Day last year, we showed in 2026, so once we get fully on the other side of all this stuff I just described, a 5x expansion in free cash flow out of TCO versus 2021. So it's meaningful. Devin McDermott : Okay. Great. Thank you very much for the helpful answer there. And thinking about this year, 2023 in more detail. You talked about 0% to 3% total production growth for the year, led by sale in the Permian. And last year, you had another strong one for the Permian unit volumes were up 16%. I was wondering if you could just talk through your expectations for that asset in 2023, whether or not you're adding rigs there, overall activity trends? And then more broadly within that 2% to 3% range, what are some of the drivers that can move to the upper or lower end as we move through the year. Mike Wirth : Yes. Maybe I'll finish on -- I think the second question is about overall production, and the first was about Permian. So our outlook for 2023 at $80 is flat to up 3%, so that post between 3 million and 3.1 million barrels a day. There's a modest adjustment that relative to our Investor Day guidance. A couple of things driving that, some project deferrals like Mad Dog 2, which we thought would start up in 2022 and now looks like a 2023 startup. We've got some downtime, plans downtime that shifted from 2022 to 2023. And then our Permian growth would be a little bit lower in 2023. A couple of things. One, in 2022, we had the benefit of a lot of prior DUCs that had been sitting that came online and it boost early production in 2022, a little bit more. And then we also are re-optimizing some of our development plans to factor in some of the things we continue to learn relative to interactions between wells and benches, how we space laterals and do single or multi-bench development. So our revised plan will have some deeper targets, a few more rig moves and a few more single bench developments, all of which brings that pace down a little bit. So that's kind of at the highest level, what is behind the production numbers. We'll talk about that more when we see you guys in a month here. And maybe I'll stop there, because I did cover the Permian as part of that. Thanks, Devin. Katie, we can go the next question. Katie, can you hear us? Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning team and congrats here on a good year. Hey, Mike, I guess the first question I have for you is around global gas. And maybe you can talk about how you're seeing the market. There's obviously been a tremendous amount of volatility and remind us again how you're positioned from a contracted versus spot position? And then I have a follow-up on gas as well in the Eastern Med. Mike Wirth : Okay. Well, high level, we certainly have seen a very unusual and volatile year in 2022, which has settled out here as we've come into the winter, primarily as we've seen a bit milder winter in the northern hemisphere than is typical. And as in Europe, the successful build of inventories for this year and the reduction of industrial demand have both resulted in an outlook that is less dire for the European economies, than it may have looked like several months ago. And so I think the market reflects all of that. You also have the fact that China has been -- the economy has been slow throughout the year, which is -- looks to be turning around. And so I think it's good that markets have calmed. I mean the high prices really were creating a lot of stresses out there that are not good. And I hope we see these prices stay in a more moderate range as we enter 2023. Our posture is largely as we've described it before, we're primarily contracted on oil index pricing, biggest piece, obviously, out of Australia. We do have -- we ran really well in Australia last year, a record number of cargoes and so there were some spot cargoes in the mix out of Australia, out of West Africa, we've got a little more spot exposure in Angola and now with Equatorial Guinea as well. But think of us as primarily oil-linked. And we've got some sensitivities, I think that Pierre has put out there, and we've reiterated some of those in the guidance today that should help you model these things based on your assumptions on gas prices. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Mike. And that's the follow-up. You have a large gas position in the Eastern Mediterranean, following the noble acquisition with Leviathan and Tamar and some discoveries out there as well. So how do you think about prosecuting that asset? Where does it fall in terms of prioritization? And how big can it be? Mike Wirth : Yes. It's a high priority. We took FID at the end of last year on a project to expand Tamar from -- on a 100% basis, 1.1 to 1.6 Bcf per day. The first gas on that should come online in early 2025. We are working on development options to expand Leviathan. Those are still being worked and we should narrow the concepts on that later this year and reach some decisions in terms of how we intend to do that. The Nargis discovery, it's just one well at this point, but it encountered a significant section of high-quality gas-bearing sandstone. So very attractive. We're talking to our partner there about appraisal and development concepts that will follow. So that region -- and of course, we've got a number of additional exploration blocks further to the west in the Mediterranean that we've not yet put any wells into but we've got seismic and we're developing our exploration plans and you'll hear more about that as we go forward. So it's a high priority. The region needs gas, both regionally in the Middle East, but also then obviously options to try to get that gas into Europe. And so the noble acquisition was really advantageous from that standpoint, and we're optimistic about the prospectivity of some of these additional exploration blocks. Neil Mehta : Very well. Stay tuned. Thanks, Mike. Mike Wirth : Okay. Thank you, Neil. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Well, thanks, everyone. Roderick, I'd like to also pass on my thanks. You've transformed Chevron does Investor Relations. Thank you for all your help. Guys, I wonder if I could go back to the buyback. I just want to try and understand a little bit about the comment around really just how you think about the purpose of the buyback. Is this really about dividend management at this point? Because it seems to us that, if you take your Brent sensitivity into account, the run rate at the high end of the range puts you about a $90 breakeven on your oil price. And I'm just wondering if this is about value or about managing confidence in future dividend growth. Mike Wirth : Well, let me try to be clear on this, Doug. We do not do buybacks to manage dividends. Dividend -- absolute dividend load is an outcome. It's not a reason that you would do buybacks. Our dividend growth expresses confidence in the ability to grow free cash flow at mid-cycle prices, and it is a long-term decision, a long, long, long-term decision. We haven't cut the dividend since the great depression. Pierre mentioned, we've increased the payout 36 years in a row now. Buybacks are different. They signal confidence that we're going to generate excess free cash flow, where we've got excess balance sheet capacity, which we have significant capacity in the current commodity cycle. And as we satisfy our commitments on the dividend, our reinvestment plans in a disciplined manner to grow free cash flows and maintain that strong balance sheet, we've got the capacity then to buy shares back through the cycle. An outcome of buybacks is a lower absolute dividend, but it's not the driver. And so, I don't want -- there should be no confusion about that. We've got confidence in our dividend increases, whether we're buying shares back or not. We wouldn't increase the dividend if we didn't have that confidence. And so the two are not linked in that manner. Doug Leggate : That's very clear. Thanks, Mike. My follow-up is a bit unfair, given your Analyst Day is a month away, but I'm going to give this a go anyway. But -- so if you made the point in -- your balance sheet is in terrific shape, obviously. You've got a lot of capacity there. But also, if I go back to that sort of $90 breakeven, all I'm doing is taking that $15 billion run rate, $400 million a year and adding it to the $50 breakeven, $90. What does that say about your outlook for maybe stepping up growth capital? That would seem to imply that the growth capital of the $17 billion for the CapEx number is probably what we should expect going forward. Is that the right way to think about it, or should we wait until the end of the month, at the end of February? Mike Wirth : Yes. I mean, we'll talk about it more in February. I'm not sure I followed all your math there, but we're growing. We had a 3% compound annual growth rate at $15 billion to $17 billion of CapEx in a market that's not growing that fast. We're growing well better than the overall demand for oil or for gas, which is growing faster than oil is. And so, we are growing production, but what we're really focused on is growing returns and cash flow. And if we can grow returns and cash flow, the equation works. And so, I -- we'll be happy to talk about this more when we're together at the end of the month, but -- or at the end of next month. But we can grow cash flow; we can improve returns at the rate that we're spending at. And so, I don't know why there would be a question about our ability to do that and the production numbers and outcome of those decisions. It's not the goal. Doug Leggate : Appreciate the answers. Really glad. See you soon. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, guys. Mike Wirth : Good morning, John. John Royall : Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. So maybe just kind of a spin on Doug's question. So with the balance sheet at 3%, is there a point where you think of yourself is actually underlevered and I realize that's a good problem to have. But if you ever got to that point with the mechanism be to get leverage higher by increasing the buyback, or how do you think about that generally is the 3% where you want to be? Pierre Breber : This is Pierre. I'll take that. Our guidance is for the net debt ratio to be between 20% and 25% and mid-cycle conditions. And as you said, we're at 3%, so we're much stronger than that. And that's what happens in the short-term. So Mike has talked about our financial priorities. They're simple. We've been consistent with them for a very long time. And three of the four are pegged. We just increased our dividend 6%. We have a 2023 CapEx budget of $14 billion. We've given guidance that keeps that CapEx flat over the next several years. And we have the buybacks at the top end of the guidance range of $15 billion. So swings in cash flow in the short-term will go to the balance sheet. And that's because commodity prices and margins, we just were talking about natural gas prices and refining margins and things are moving up and down. But over the long-term, those cash flows will be returned to shareholders. And so we want to do it in a way that is steady across the cycle. As Mike said, we don't want to be pro-cyclical. And by the way, we haven't, right? Our track record shows that over the past nearly two decades that we've been able to buy actually below what the market average price has been. So the intent is to, yeah, we'll be a little strong balance sheet depending on commodity prices and margins and how strong our operations have been. But then over time, the cycle will correct and then we'll continue buying back shares. We've said we could have a higher buyback rate right now. We're sizing it at a level to maintain it for multiple years across the cycle. That means there'll be a time period where we'll be buying back shares off the balance sheet, and we'll lever back up closer to that 20% to 25% guidance. Thanks, John. John Royall : Very clear. Thank you, Pierre. And just a follow-up on the TCO project. I was hoping you could give an update on the CPC terminal operationally and where that stands. And then what type of discounts are you seeing at that terminal right now? I think you called out a few quarters ago or maybe two quarters ago that it was $6 or $7 per barrel. I imagine that's come in a bit. So where is that discount today? And how is that terminal operating? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So last year, there was probably more news than there was impact on a variety of issues relative to the pipeline and the terminal. There was work going on in the late third and into the fourth quarter on the two of the three single point mornings. All that work is done. All three SPMs are operational today. There are no constraints on loading. There are no constraints on throughput on the pipe. Despite a lot of the things that people heard and worried about last year, the pipeline was very reliable. Our production was impacted less than 10,000 barrels a day over the course of the year. It was all a few weeks in March and April. And so everything there is running very smoothly now, and we don't see any constraints. Discounts have come in a little bit on CPC. In the immediate aftermath of some of the sanctions and changes related to Ukraine. We saw a trading range that was like $4 to $10 below dated Brent. And before the conflict began, it was plus or minus $1. We're seeing kind of $1 to $3 discounts now. So maybe not quite at pre-invasion levels, but not as deep as they were immediately afterwards. And given the overall flat price environment and the way it has strengthened the impact to CCO is relatively muted. Operator : We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Mike Wirth : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Hey, good morning, guys. Just looking at, let's call it, refined product demand. You talked about gas demand earlier. I'm just curious, as you look around the world, we've got positives moving away from COVID on a year-over-year comparison and then everybody's got high expectations for the China reopening. I was just curious, as you look across your operating base, what you're seeing there? Mike Wirth : Yeah. Overall, Roger, gasoline demand, I'll start there. Still just a touch below pre-pandemic levels, fourth quarter of 2022 maybe 2% or 3% below fourth quarter of 2019. If you look at diesel, demand is pretty flat versus pre-pandemic. Jet recovering, but still below and so at the highest level, we're kind of still flattish to recovering from pre-COVID. I think that's why there is concern that as China's economy really does come through and return to a more normal level, that we could see increased demand start to pull on these markets again. You've seen announcements out of China about their intention. We see international flights and air travel now being scheduled at much higher levels than we've seen before long. And if you see the kind of rebound spending and activity in that economy that we've seen in other economies around the world, that's one of the things that could buoy the global economy and firm up demand for products. So, there's still some variables in the equation. We're not past the risk of recession and clearly, central banks are still tightening to slow things in certain parts of the world. So there's some puts and takes. But net-net, this continues to trend in a recovering direction with the two biggest questions probably related to the two biggest economies, China and the US. Roger Read : Always the big guys, right? A follow-up question to come back to the Permian, and I recognize the Investor Day coming. But Pierre, when we were at the sell-side dinner end of November, there was a lot of discussion over kind of the changing in the range and how that was really just a function of messaging more so than \u2013 overall change in the way you're developing the Permian, kind of following from that to the comments about things a little different in the bench and the DUC comparisons year-over-year. You look at it as any different from the messaging at the end of November, or is this \u2013 is there something else here with. Pierre Breber : No, nothing different. We'll show that at our Investor Day. Again, we were in the middle of the range. You can see the fourth quarter number was 738. So that was strong. We had some learning's, as Mike said, in 2022, and we've adjusted our plans to go to deeper targets and more single bench developments and that results in a little longer drilling times and a few more rig moves and we'll update all that. And all that is obviously included in our production guidance. So we'll continue to learn and adapt in the Permian. It's a large royalty advantage position. It's an asset that delivers higher returns and lower carbon. It's a big source of free cash flow. Our free cash flow growth over the next five years is really driven by Permian, [indiscernible], Gulf of Mexico, a few other assets. And it's remarkable to have an asset that can grow at that rate and do it free cash flow positive the whole time and free cash flow growing the whole time. So, it will ebb and flow a little bit as we learn more, but what you'll see at our Investor Day, something very consistent with what we're saying today and what we said in the past. Mike Wirth : And Roger, just to emphasize the point I made earlier to another one of the questions, we remain focused on returns and value, not on production. And so that is the -- that's what drives all of this. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe General. Irene Himona : Thank you very much for taking my questions which are both related. So, I will ask both at the same time. So, firstly, thinking about balance sheet strength, of course, the other use it can be put to is M&A. You've been very disciplined with your M&A timings, both with Noble and Regi [ph]. How do you see the current market in these two, let's say, POTS [ph] legacy oil and gas versus low carbon? And then secondly, has the IRA Act perhaps changed your appetite for faster expansion in low carbon businesses, please? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Thank you, Irene. So, we do have the capacity to do M&A. We don't need to do M&A. And so, we'll only do deals that are value-creating deals. You interestingly contrast the traditional oil and gas market with the new energies market. What I would observe is given commodity price strength in oil and gas, we've seen companies that previously might have been languishing from a value standpoint, strengthen. And I think there's some optimism in the eyes of other companies about the future. And so, the bid/ask spread on oil and gas companies is maybe a little wider right now given the strength versus when we did our deal a couple of years ago. In lower carbon, with interest rates rising and spacs kind of receiving and the like. A little bit of the kind of froth may have come out of that market, but they're still some optimism in valuations there as well. And so, we'll be very thoughtful and careful as we evaluate those. And there are a lot of companies out there that have got business models in this space. So, we watch them all. We will be back to talk to you if we have anything that's interesting. Let me touch on IRA and then ask Pierre to add a little more color. The IRA will probably accelerate some activity in the US. There's no doubt. Hopefully, what that does is it allows technologies to be de-risked. The cost of technologies to be reduced and the attractiveness of these investments to improve. A bill like that with kind of a grab bag of different policy incentives doesn't necessarily change our long-term view on how we want to build businesses. It does perhaps change the trajectory at which some of those businesses become more economically viable. And if that's the case, that could feed through into our similar investment decision. But it's kind of a second order effect rather than a first order effect. Pierre Breber : And just to add some of the other important effects, permitting really critical for traditional energy, super critical for new energy, new technology developments, you've seen us make some investments on technology to reduce the cost of capture of CO2 and then scale, getting cost down. So it's helpful, but it's just one element, as Mike said. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Irene Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe if I could ask a couple on the downstream side. First, there's been a lot of noise earlier this year about refinery maintenance activity looking to be well above average in the US, particularly in the first half of the year, especially amongst independent refiners. Your first quarter guidance seems to suggest turnaround activity in 1Q that's reasonably light or at least not terribly heavy. Any thoughts on whether 2020 -- year 2023 outlook as a whole for Chevron looks normal or heavy in terms of refining and maintenance. And then maybe more broadly, how you see general tightness in global refining markets this year over the course of 2023? Mike Wirth : Yes. I would say it's a pretty typical year for turnaround activity. We've got the FCC at El Segundo in the first quarter of this year, which Pierre mentioned in his comments. But there's nothing unusual in our turnaround plan for this year. What you do see across the US and I think in some of the other markets are two things that are really kind of still echoes of COVID. One is you're just seeing capacity go out of the system. And two, you see maintenance that was deferred during COVID is -- had to be rescheduled and replanned. And so there's probably still a bit of a bow wave of pushing through the system in some places of activity that needs to get done for safety and reliability and regulatory reasons. And so that could be driving some of the speculation. I can't really comment on other companies' plans. I'll let you talk to them about that. Ryan Todd : Okay. And then maybe on the other side of your downstream business on the chemical side, it's clearly been weeks for the last little while. Looking forward from here, is the combination of lower natural gas prices and the reopening of China having any impact on how you see margins moving throughout 2023, or do you anticipate that oversupply keep things weaker throughout the year? Mike Wirth : These tend to be long period cycles for the most part, Ryan. And so, at the margin, I think that's economic growth and development in China is a positive. But you don't slide into the lower part of the cycle quickly or easily, and you generally don't come out of it quickly or easily. So these things track over a longer period of time. And so, I do think we're -- it feels like we're kind of bumping along near the bottom here, but I don't know that there's a steep climb out as opposed to a gradual climb over time. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first follow up on the affiliate distribution guidance because it is taking a step higher year-over-year, and it sounds like that was due to TCO having excess cash. Is that kind of $5 billion to $6 billion, something you can maintain assuming oil price stays stable until the project actually starts up until TCO FGP starts up or would you expect that to fall off after this year? And then my second question is on a different topic, Venezuela. I believe you have now boots on the ground there again. Can you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of the health of the infrastructure there, the ability to ramp production and the desire from Chevron's standpoint to participate in that? Thanks. Pierre Breber : On affiliate dividends, there are two main factors why the guidance this year is higher than last year. You hit one of them on TCO, not held excess cash last year. The second big one is Angola LNG. You recall, a lot of their cash distributions were actually return to capital. It's an accounting concept tied to whether you have book equity or positive book equity or not now, they're in that space. So we expect most, if not all, of the cash coming from Angola LNG in 2023 to be characterized as dividends. It was cash either way. It's just one shows up in cash from ops, the other one shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but that's the second driver. And in terms of the direction, I mean, this guidance is kind of notionally at the current -- futures curve around $80. So it depends on commodity prices and margins. There are some downstream affiliates in there, the chemicals, obviously, in there. But we talked about TCO. I mean, TCO's heading up, right. As CapEx comes down and production comes up, we expect more dividends out of TCO going forward. And then again, we have the loan that we also expect TCO to pay back during the next several years. Mike Wirth : Yes, Jason, on Venezuela, we always did have boots on the ground. We just were very limited in where those boots could go and what they could do. The shift in the sanctions policy has opened up a little more room. It's allowed us to work with PDVSA to put some of our people into different roles in these mixed companies there. So we do have a little more ability to have influence and involvement in some of the decision making. Your question about the state of the infrastructure, there's been a lack of investments there for a number of years in the infrastructure reflects that, and it will take time for things to turn around. We have seen some positive production response already in the entities that we're involved in. They're producing about 90,000 barrels a day now, which is up about 40,000 barrels a day since we saw the change in these license terms. So that's been a good short-term effect. I'm not going to say you can extrapolate that, but it's where we are today. We are continuing to work on the ground to expand production, but it's too early to guide to anything. We're also lifting oil and bringing it to the US. We've got a couple of cargoes coming into our Pascagoula Refinery. We're going to be delivering cargoes to other customers on the Gulf Coast. And then the revenues go into a series of structured channels to pay expenses and other obligations. On the accounting standpoint, we're using cost affiliate accounting. So we'll record earnings only if we receive cash. And at this point, I would say the cash flows are expected to be modest. So this is a step-wise change in the environment there. We're going to go into it thoughtfully. It's a six-month license, and it's a dynamic environment. So we'll continue to advise you as we learn more and as things evolve. Jason Gabelman : Great. Thanks a lot for the detail. Mike Wirth : You bet. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : I'll ask about the Rockies. The Rockies is interesting. It's a place where you could maybe add a little bit of activity to face your aggregate Lower 48 activity levels, but without some of the inflationary pressures and just infrastructure tightness in the Permian and inventory depth there is good. Is the Rockies a place where there may be a little bit of extra focus. And I ask that in the context of sort of the broader theme around your overall resource depth and production and all these topics that are sort of flowing into the broader conversation today. Mike Wirth : Yes, absolutely, Sam. We got over 320,000 net acres there. Last year, we started out with one rig and one frac crew. We ended the year with three rigs and two frac crews working and the plan for this year is activity in that level. So it's been a positive movement in terms of activity and production expectations there. It's a really nice resource. It's a low carbon resource. It's a -- we got a lot of this is powered off the grid. There's been some permitting questions about this in the past. There's been large areas done under development plans, and we've got permits well out into the future and continue to work that closely with the authorities there. So -- it's one we can talk about a little bit more at Investor Day. It's a really positive part of addition to our portfolio out of Noble and the Eastern Med gets a lot of attention, but we're very excited about the DJ. Sam Margolin : Okay. And yes, just a follow-up. I mean, because obviously, between -- I think you can surmise the reserve numbers getting some attention to the overall pace of activity and production trends over the long-term are getting attention. But we'll get to this at the Analyst Day, I'm sure. But is there a way right now where you can kind of add it all up and size the Gulf of Mexico, other shale and tight, Eastern Med gas and just kind of frame that aggregate resource number against maybe what you see in the portfolio today as tail resource and just speak to a final answer around your organic portfolio and how it extends. Mike Wirt : Yes. I might have Roderick work with you. So we're clear on the question when we get to the Investor Day on how to compare and size things relative to the portfolio. But we said today in our press release that we're very confident we're going to exceed our 3% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. You can't do that unless you get depth in the portfolio, which we have. And you got quality projects they're moving along on a good pace. And so I'll assure you that, that is the case. We will talk about this more at Investor Day, and you'll have a chance to kind of go deeper into it with our folks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hi. Good morning, everyone and Roderick, congratulations, all the best. Mike, I was a bit surprised by the major buyback announcement. Obviously, the $75 billion is very splashy. But within that, it seems that your guidance has remained that you'll be in the $5 billion to $15 billion a year range based on the Q1 guidance. Is there -- are you expecting to step that up, or is this a five-year authorization? And were you conscious that it would probably cause a lot of political backlash? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yes. So, Pierre answered the question earlier, it's not a five-year authorization. It's an open-ended authorization. It is -- it's our intent to maintain it across the cycle. I'll just say that again. It's actually aligned with our upside in our downside cases from the 2022 Investor Day and consistent with our track record of being in the market steadily buying $2 below the market over nearly the past two decades. And we could increase our guidance range, Paul. We need to be confident we could maintain that higher rate for multiple years across the cycle. And I think that you should read it as a signal of confidence and we'll continue to talk more. We raised our buyback rate three times last year. So we're not averse to doing that. And I would just say stay tuned. In terms of the reaction to it, I think it's perhaps been a touch overblown given that it's an open-ended program, and we could have sized a smaller one and just been prepared to do another one sooner. Pierre said, we're closing one out. We just looked at something that would last over a number of years, and we were trying to be splashy when we're trying to create any reaction out there. We're just trying to indicate the confidence we have in our cash generation. Paul Sankey : Understood. And offset to that, Mike, you're spending more on exploration. Could you just talk about the highlights that you see coming up in 2023. Obviously, we're aware of East Med, but there's other stuff out there and the spending has stepped up quite a lot, hasn't it? Mike Wirth : Yes. I don't know if I describe the spending as being up quite a lot. We've got a nice portfolio that we like. And I'll just touch on -- you mentioned Eastern Med. We still have a lot of blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We've got block in Suriname that we're still working on and that are on trend with some of the things in that region. We've picked up acreage in Namibia that's on trend with explorations in that part of the world as well. And so we got stuff in Brazil, we had stuff in Mexico that we acquired a few years prior to that. So we've got a nice portfolio of opportunities that we continue to work on. And we don't go out and drill the wells until we're ready to drill them. But it's spread across a number of basins where there's good working oil and gas systems. And the Nargis discovery is a recent example of what happens when you focus in those areas, and I'm optimistic that we're going to see more of that in the future. Paul Sankey : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our last question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one is on the share count. Just going back to early 2022 of the period where you're stepping up the buyback program, but the dilution from the employee options are offsetting that rule. So I'm just trying to understand, I know you took a charge today in the corporate line. Do you expect 2023 dilution to be a similar level to 2022, or should it be lower? Just any sense on that would be helpful. Pierre Breber : We expect fewer employee and retiree exercises of stock options. That was extraordinary unusual in the first quarter. And it's a zero-sum game. In other words, if employees and retirees do it early, there's fewer to do going forward. But that will be up to them and the stock price performance. And the share buybacks, I mean, you just divide it, depends on what our stock price is. We give guidance quarterly, and I think you can do the math. It is confusing the difference between average annual share count and where we end, right? So we are clearly taking our share count down. But when you look at average annuals, that's exactly what it implies. It's an annual each day, but the trend is going down. Our buybacks exceed the issuances and we expect that to continue. Biraj Borkhataria : That's very clear. And then second question is just thinking about asset sales. Looking at your guidance, 2023 plans are fairly muted. And I appreciate that you're basically at close to zero debt, so you don't actually need to do anything but in a high commodity price environment, maybe counter-cyclically, you might want to accelerate something. So is this a function of just the limited cleanup needed in the portfolio or a view on bid-ask spread or anything else, just to get your view on the asset sale market at the moment? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yeah. So Biraj, we are a little lower than what our typical level of guidance has been a level of activity. Over the last decade, we've generated about $35 billion in asset sales. So that's, say, 3.5%. There was some portfolio cleanup underway there that was needed to be done, and we get good value as we sold those. You're always looking at your tail. There's always -- when you sell things off, there's a new part of your portfolio and say, okay, this sits at the margin. And so you're always challenging that. If we were to find interested buyers and some of the things that might fit better for others than they do for us, we could transact on that. This is -- the guidance that we've got right now and the things that are underway and in process is what we've put out there, and we'll update you if there's any changes to that. Pierre Breber : And the only add, Biraj, we don't do asset sales to raise cash or to manage the balance sheet. We do it based on what Mike just said, high grading of the portfolio where we can get the best returns for capital projects that can compete for capital, some of the impairments that we took in the fourth quarter are a result and outcome of projects that are good projects. They're just not good enough to clear the bar. So it does ebb and flow a little bit as Mike has said, but I just want to be clear, we do it as part of our capital discipline and having driving higher returns and lower carbon. It's an outcome of that. It ebbs and flows. It's a little low this year. We set it to go back higher in future years. Roderick Green : Thanks Biraj. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering, please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I\u2019m Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Wirth : Chevron delivered strong financial results again last quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter with return on capital employed greater than 12%. This enabled another record for cash returned to shareholders while maintaining a very strong balance sheet. Since our investor day two months ago, we\u2019ve remained focused on executing our plans. Achieving important milestones on our major project in Kazakhstan, continuing to build activity levels in the Permian, positioning Bayou Bend to be one of the largest carbon storage projects in the United States, and safely and reliably delivering oil, products and natural gas that help power the global economy. Next week, we\u2019ll publish our Corporate Sustainability Report. I encourage you to review it on our website as we provide updates on the ESG topics that matter to our business and our stakeholders. In closing, while commodity markets remain uncertain, our approach is unchanged : capital and cost discipline applied to advantaged assets in both traditional and new energy businesses and steady returns of cash to shareholders. You can see that consistency in our actions and our results. Now to Pierre to discuss the quarter. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.6 billion, or $3.46 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.7 billion, or $3.55 per share. We had one special item this quarter related to changes in the energy profits tax in the United Kingdom. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Strong operating cash flow enabled Chevron to deliver on its financial priorities during the quarter a 6% per share dividend increase, higher CapEx within budget, net debt ratio under 5%, share repurchases at the top of our prior guidance range. Adjusted first quarter earnings were up over $200 million versus last year despite 20% lower oil prices. Adjusted Upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins. Both segments benefitted from a change in timing effects. Higher interest income and lower accruals for stock-based compensation decreased all other charges.  Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $1.1 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower realizations. Other items include the absence of last quarter\u2019s dividend withholding tax at TCO and lower exploration and transportation expenses. Adjusted Downstream earnings were essentially flat. Lower margins and volumes were offset with higher chemical earnings and other favorable items including trading results. Lower accruals for incentive-based compensation decreased All Other net charges and also benefitted the operating segments  First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset. This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we\u2019re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator. The balance is with dozens of other operators where we have a little less visibility, but similar predictability from greater diversification. More than half of our royalty production comes from the Pecos River area in the heart of the Delaware Basin. The balance of our royalty position is in the remainder of the Delaware and Midland Basins, also with well-known operators.  In summary, Chevron has a large, diverse position in the Permian with a unique royalty advantage where we learn from our own operations and from others. Now, looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of Mexico along with downtime at a FSO in Thailand and a number of planned refinery turnarounds. Also, we expect share buybacks to increase to a $17.5 billion annual rate. In summary, 1Q was another quarter with strong financial results, continued capital discipline, and a steady return of cash to shareholders. We\u2019re confident that consistent and straightforward management, through commodity cycles, will create value for stakeholders. Back to you, Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered.  Katie, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jake Spiering : Good morning, Devin. Devin McDermott : Good morning. So there were some helpful detail in the slides and the remarks on the breakdown of permeant operations. If I look at the quarter, your volumes did fall a bit sequentially in 1Q versus 4Q. I wonder if you could just talk in a bit more detail about some of the drivers there, how things are going as you ramp New Mexico activity. And that's typically the confidence that you have in that back-half weighted production ramp. Mike Wirth : Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Devin. Pierre tried to show a little more detail, including breaking out COOP JV, royalty, talking about drilling activity and feed drilled et cetera. So glad that that was helpful.  First quarter performance was a function of really the fact that NOJV and royalty production, which as you can see from that chart is, a meaningful portion of our overall production, was down a little bit from fourth quarter of last year. Now, this gets a little a little lumpy due to how it gets reported by partners. And so, over time, it's trended up, particularly the NOJV piece. But it was a little lumpy, and it was down first quarter versus fourth quarter last year,  COOP production was mostly flat from 4Q of last year to first quarter this year. In terms of the full year outlook, on Slide 9, we show full year outlook, it's about 770,000 barrels a day. '22 was a little bit over 700 -- 707, I think, Our COOP production will grow in the mid-single digits. NOJV, we expect to grow in the mid-teens, and royalty is roughly flat year-on-year as our expectation. So that kind of lays out first quarter and we still think that the guide would give us appropriate as Pierre said, back-end loaded. So, we'll be updating each quarter on that. Devin McDermott : Got it makes sense. Thanks. And my follow up is on TCO. And it's exciting that we're now less than a year away from startup there and back at the Investor Day, you noticed that you had shifted to commissioning and the startup work for WPMP. I was wondering if you just give us an update on how things are going their latest expectations on timing. And then also the key milestones that we should be keeping an eye out for the balance of this year ahead of startup. Mike Wirth : Yeah, absolutely. I actually was in Kazakhstan earlier this month. I had a chance to meet with the President of the Republic, some other senior officials, And also spent time down at Tengiz and visited the job site, talk to both people from our construction team, people from the commissioning team, people from operations as we're preparing for startup. And I'll tell you, it looks a little less like a construction site a little bit more like a plant than it did the last time I was down there. So the progress is very obvious. The headline I'll give you is there's no change to our cost or schedule guidance. We expect WPMP startup to begin by the end of this year. Now that's a conversion of the field from high pressure to low pressure. So that will take some time as we take all the metering stations and field infrastructure down to low pressure, but that will still begin by the end of this year. And the startup of the future growth projects, the portion that adds 260,000 barrels of oil production that will begin by mid next year. Both of these require a series of turnarounds and tie-ins and things like that. So it's quite a quite a complex set of activities to get us to the point where we've got everything online.  But there's a lot of work behind us. While I was there, we achieved mechanical completion on the third-generation sour gas injection facility, which was ahead of schedule. And there were a number of milestones that I mentioned that we talked about at the Investor Day that that we've achieved. So we completed tie-in of the fuel gas system so the first gas turbine generator we fired that generator so we know that it's working. In the second quarter in terms of milestones to watch for, we're working to commission boilers, steam system, other utilities that are required for the startup of the pressure boost facility, which is the key driver of that conversion from high pressure to low pressure field operations to enable sustained well deliverability.  In the third quarter, we expect mechanical completion of the future growth project. And then, as I said, will begin startup activities on the field conversion to low pressure by the end of this year. So those are some of the key milestones. And, like I say, a lot behind us, but there's still a lot of complex work ahead. We'll be updating you on it every quarter. Devin McDermott : Good to hear. Thanks, Mike. Mike Wirth : All right, Devin. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. . Neil Mehta : Yeah, thank you so much, Mike and Pierre. The first question is just around the LNG portfolio, a lot of volatility in the global gas markets over the course of the last year, just be curious how you guys are seeing the outlook and any updates on your portfolio, particularly down in Australia, where recognized you're going to take into maintenance, but seems like it's operating pretty well. Mike Wirth : Sure. So -- overall, it's been a bit of a wild ride in gas markets over the last year. And we've seen prices are extraordinarily strong. If you go back two years ago, they were extraordinarily weak. And they've certainly moderated now, as we've had warmer weather in the northern hemisphere, through the wintertime, as the situation in Europe has, I think become a little more stable. Certainly, inventories both in Europe and in the U.S. are much healthier than people were concerned about it at one point in time.  And so, we're into a market that still is perhaps strong by historic standards, but certainly not nearly as strong as what we saw. Operations that Gorgon and Wheatstone are running very well. We had a record number of LNG cargoes go out of Australia last year. It was 10% better than the best year we've ever had. Reliability was first quartile for the two facilities. And so we feel good about that. We've started -- or this year, we'll start the second turnaround cycle, which is a four-year cycle to turn trains around Gorgon Train 1 will have a major planned turnaround in the second quarter of this year. And the course, we're working on the next stage of field development to continue to keep the field full with wells drilled and in startup activity, time activity, et cetera underway, on the next phase of the gas developments to bring that into the facility.  So things in Australia are good from an operational standpoint and a reliability standpoint. More broadly speaking, we continue to look at opportunities in our LNG portfolio beyond Australia. Certainly, we've talked at some length about the Eastern ramp. So belabor that, but looking at concepts and expect to select a concept on the Leviathan expansion, by the end of this year. And an Equatorial Guinea we're looking at opportunities to bring additional gas resources in through existing infrastructure.  So continue to be very focused on what we can do to add value in our LNG business, but to do it in a way that's returns accretive. Neil Mehta : That's great. And then the follow up is, is just on return of capital. And I think you guys have been pretty clear about the range that we should be thinking about from a buyback perspective. Just on dividend growth, just talk about how do you expect that to track relative to your free cash flow per share expectations? Mike Wirth : Yeah, I think we have been clear on buybacks, so I won't spend time on that. On dividends, I would say our track record should speak for itself. Of course, these are decisions that are made by the board each year, but we've got 30 -- 36 consecutive years now of higher payouts over the last five years. Our dividend growth per share has been double that of our closest peers. So we've sustained this not over the long haul, but also in the short term through the volatile period of time that we've seen. Our dividend track record, I think stands very well. Reiterate our four financial priorities, the first of which is to sustain and grow the dividend, as I just mentioned, 6% increase earlier this year in a compound annual growth rate of 6% over the last 15 years. So, I think -- again, I'll say our track record on the dividends speaks for itself.  I think Pierre mentioned that the quarter we just closed included the highest ever cash distributions to shareholders for the fourth consecutive quarter that we can that, and we're very mindful of, continuing to deliver cash in a in a predictable and consistent manner back to shareholders through both of those vehicles. Neil Mehta : Yep. Thanks, Mike. Mike Wirth : Okay, Neil, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah, thank you. Good morning. Maybe come back to the Permian a little bit. I know you've been providing us a lot more detail on things. And I appreciate that detail for the overall production breakdown in the U.S.  But looking at the Permian, the Chevron operated portion versus your JV non-op, is we think about some of the snags that have been hit over the last couple of quarters, where have been the biggest problems? Is it been in the operated or the non-operated? And then as you think about correcting those over the next couple of quarters, how much of that is Chevron-controlled versus partner? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So I will speak to our operated operation, because I really can't speak on behalf of the others. They should speak on behalf of their operations. We certainly learned from those. But, we spent a pretty good amount of time at the Investor Day, talking about the learnings on a drill been uncompleted wells that had sat for a long time talking about the prior basis of design for the wells, including spacing and profit loading, talking about multi-venture development.  And we've learned a lot from our own operations, and those learnings are augmented by the things that we learned from others. And so we talked about more single bench development, more activity. In New Mexico, we continue to be very focused on driving strong returns, and not optimizing to production or some other ther metric.  Just to give you a little bit more guidance, Roger for this year, in terms of how to think about it. We expect royalty production to be roughly flat, in the neighborhood of, a little bit over 100,000, maybe 110,000 barrels a day. Most of that comes from the Pecos River area where we've got big operators, Oxy's largest operator in that area, but others that are well known operators in that area. And then we've got some that comes in from the Midland as well from big operators where there's a lot of visibility into what their plans are. Our COOP production growth, we expect to be mid-single digits for the full year. Maybe a touch higher than the midpoint of single digits and expect roughly 190 wells to be put on production this year, which is down a little bit from last year, maybe 10% from last year when our COOP production increased 35,000 barrels a day. We've got growth in the Texas side of the Delaware earlier in the year, the New Mexico side, later in the year, which follows the chart Pierre showed you with drilling lateral feet.  And then in the NOJV, the growth is higher. It's in the mid-teens for the full year. The gross number of POPs in our NOJVs are expected to be up about 15% year-on-year. And it's interesting, our net POPs actually increased more than the gross because we have relatively high working interest and a significant royalty advantage in the non-ops.  And so a 15% increase in gross POPs actually translates into more production than you might presume. We've got really good visibility into the execution schedule we've received more than three quarters of the AFEs for this year's activity. And operations have actually begun on more than three quarters of the NOJV wells that we expect to be popped this year. So it's a mix. We've got a really strong, but also a bit of a complex portfolio because of these three different contributors and we're continuing to hold the guidance, as I said earlier, at about 770 for full year. Roger Read : No, that's great. I appreciate that. And a follow-up question, I suspect, is for you, Pierre. Working capital, obviously tends to be a draw in Q1. You've got the sounds like a decent level of planned maintenance in Q2. So just any thoughts on how we should look at overall cash flow generation Q2, maybe rest of the year in terms of the cadence? Pierre Breber : Well, in terms of working capital, Roger, the first quarter, as you said, was a build in working capital draw on cash, and that was primarily inventory related. If you saw last year, we had draws on working capital that was primarily through taxes payable. And you'll see in the second quarter, some of those payments happening. We try to give everything excluding working capital because over the course of time, that tends to zero out and there's a pattern, but there's some variability around it. So that's the guidance I would give on you.  In terms of free cash flow, it depends on -- and cash from ops depends on commodity prices and margins, and we gave a lot of that during our Investor Day and some upside in downside cases. But in terms of working capital, you'll see timing effects. We try to look through them and exclude them. And then next quarter, you should expect some large tax payments, which will be obviously a draw on cash. Roger Read : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hey, good morning, guys. Have been the kind of project due to the characteristic that we have different returns and different payback period criteria that I think management put. So for your loan carbon investment, not those that for the own emission mitigation activity, but that in terms of like CCUS as a new business. For that kind of business that what is the minimum internal rate of return and payback period that you sign in order for you to sanction the projects. Mike Wirth : Yeah, Paul. Look, the reality is these are brand-new businesses. And we've got a lot of confidence in the returns and payback periods that we expect out of businesses we've been in for many decades and understand very well in well-established markets.  These are businesses that don't exist today. They are in part enabled by a government policy the rules of which are not yet fully written and the durability of which we need to ask ourselves questions about as we commit capital to it. So they're different. They're very different.  Our goal over the long term is to get similar returns out of these businesses as we get out of our core business. And so that would be double-digit returns. In the mid-term to the near term, we're going to have to go into some of these things that offer high growth and opportunity with our eyes wide open, but also understand that as we establish them in the early days, we may not see the returns that we expect in the fullness of time.  So we make big investments. Our expectation is over the life cycle of these investments, we're going to deliver those kinds of returns. But we're also mindful of the fact we've got to develop technology. We've got to scale these things. We've got to help markets mature. We've got to build operational experience. We've got to build risk management experience, supply chain and customer capabilities in these businesses.  And so in the near term, we'll be understanding of the fact that the returns in the short term will probably look different than our long-term expectations but we won't go into things that we don't believe offer the long-term prospect for returns, which is why we have steadily avoided more well-established sectors like wind and solar, where we could go into those today because the risks are better defined, but we also understand the returns. And so we were just trying to do these kinds of projects, we would go into those, but they don't offer the kinds of returns we expect out of the things that we're working on. Paul Cheng : And second question is that your largest U.S. competitor, just announced that they're going to push more aggressively into trading and establish a single trading organization and think that that's quite a fair amount of opportunities out there in the market that they can capture the sensory taking maybe that someone of a rule book from a payback from Chevron. I think Chevron has always been a little bit more conservative on that. So do you think that really the opportunity for a company similar to Chevron that have a lot of global reach and more of a physical ones and have a knowledge edge over others? So -- is there an opportunity that we may be missing that for Chevron? Mike Wirth : Well, Paul, what I would say is I think maybe your perception is a little bit miscalibrated from what I would describe. We have always had a global trading organization for many, many years, I used to run it. Pierre used to run it. And so we're in active trader. We trade in a certain way. And I'll give you the three-word kind of overarching description, we flow, optimize and trade. So the first role of our commercial organization is to ensure our barrels and molecules flow to the market. The second is to optimize assets, ships, market positions, market knowledge and be sure we get the most value out of our system that we possibly can. And then the third responsibility is to trade. And we do third-party training. We do what we call Quad 4 trading. On a regular basis, we make money at it, and we have very talented people in our organization to do. We also have good risk management systems to ensure that we understand what we're doing. So I wouldn't describe us as not being a trader. And I don't know if there's a definition, I think you used the word conservative. Look, we're a trader, but we do it in the order that I just described and have done it for a long time on a global basis. So it's a contributor to our earnings, and we continue to look to grow that part of our business. Pierre Breber : The only thing I would add, Paul, to Mike's answer is shareholders and investors don't own Chevron or like companies for trading earnings. They tend to be volatile. I think the multiples on trading earnings historically have been very low. In fact, most of the large trading houses or private company.  So Mike described exactly what our strategy is it works within the framework of a resource company and refining and petrochemicals company where investors are owning us for safely and reliably delivering energy having the commodity price exposure. And yes, if we can enhance that with trading results, that's great, but we're not going to lead with trading. Thanks, Paul. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you. This one is just a clarification question on something you said about the Permian because I think it's important. In the NOJV section, because you stack royalties with the NOJV acreage, your growth rate in the NOJV portion actually exceeds the growth rate of our partners as they reported. Is that -- that's the correct interpretation, right? That's what we're trying to communicate. Mike Wirth : Yeah. I mean our -- because we not only get our working interest production out of that, but because we also have -- and we have relatively high working interest in most of our -- these ventures. So it's not dissimilar to the working interest of the operator in most cases. But then we also have royalty advantage and we -- and we account for that or we report that to you through that NOJV.  What we describe as royalty barrels are pure royalty. We've got no capital. We've got no working interest. We're just collecting royalty as the landowner. But you're correct in your interpretation there, Sam. That is why our NOJV is growing a little faster than our co-op production for the same levels of activity. Sam Margolin : Okay. And then just as a follow-up. This is on capital allocation and I understood that you have the range out there in the buyback. The range is pretty substantial, and there is a decision to make right now about where to be within the range about whether to preserve cash for an opportunity that might come in the downturn, if that's what looks like it's on the horizon or whether to stay at the top end because we're in sort of a market equilibrium in the commodity environment, and you feel good about the pace. And I'm not asking you to predict the future, but it would be great to sort of hear your thoughts directionally about the value of kind of preserving cash on the balance sheet for any day or maintaining a faster pace? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yeah, I'm going to invite Pierre to say a couple of words. But Sam, we tried to lay out a couple of cases at Investor Day that showed you in two different price environments, what our capacity was to operate and be within the range and with a low breakeven to cover our CapEx and dividend with a lot of surplus cash already on the balance sheet and then with the very low low-debt levels that we have. We've got plenty of capacity. Pierre, maybe you can just give a thumbnail recap on the scenarios to booking them for Sam. Pierre Breber : Yeah. In our Investor Day, we looked at the high case and low case scenarios and our guidance right now is towards the high end. And let me just first be clear that we don't intend to hold $15 billion plus of cash on our balance sheet. We can run the company at $5 billion, and this is surplus cash. And this is cash that is temporarily on the balance sheet. It will be redistributed and redeployed to shareholders over time depending on the scenario and the price of both scenarios had us working down that surplus cash because it's economically inefficient for us hold it, and it's not our cash, it's our shareholders' cash. We want to return it through the cycle in a steady way, not pro-cyclically. So that's why it's accumulating. We've paid off all our debt economically, but it's a timing effect. And we showed certainly in the low side case which averaged about a $60 Brent that we could continue buybacks near the low end of the range, and we can do that on by taking surplus cash down. And then also using some of our excess debt capacity because we're well below our 20% to 25% net debt ratio. So we'd want to work towards that low end of that guidance range of 20%, again, to get to a more efficient capital structure. In terms of keeping cash for any day or strong we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet. We've been in this business for decades and decades. We know the good times don't last. We know that prices are cyclical. We want to manage that volatility for our shareholders. So our shareholders don't have to worry about the commodity price because they're going to get the dividend that Mike talked about, that's been growing for 36 consecutive years. That's grown 6% annually for 15 years. They're going to get that.  And then through a cycle, as we approach the cycle, and we're looking at the cycle coming up here, additional cash in a steady way, right now, about 5% of our shares outstanding through the form of a buyback. And so that's how we're planning to manage the volatility for our shareholders. And we've talked about if M&A is implied in your question that we shown that we tend to use equity for M&A because there is -- commodity prices are volatile. It creates a more stable deal structure. So our balance sheet will always be strong enough to enable us to not only manage commodity prices, but also make sure we're positioned to do what we need to do. And I don't need to remind you that we were the first to do a transaction coming out of COVID when we announced the acquisition of Noble Energy, and then we followed a year or so later in acquired Renewable Energy Group. Thanks, Sam. Sam Margolin : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So can you talk about the general demand trends you're seeing within your system? Are you starting to see any signs of weakness on the demand side? And if the answer is no, just curious on your views on what's happened to spot refining margins globally and what seems like still a relatively tight market. Mike Wirth : Yeah. So John, a couple of thoughts, I guess. I'll just go by the product commodities. I mean gasoline demand is essentially back to pre-pandemic levels globally. Obviously, there are regional variations in this. We're sitting in California here on this end of the call. We've had a very wet winter. And so the first quarter reflects an unusually wet season on the West Coast. In Asia, we see demand coming back, right, as economies continue to continue to open up and mobility has increased, et cetera. But broadly speaking, gasoline flat. Diesel had kind of carried the complex through COVID and global demand has been at pre-pandemic levels for a while now. First quarter demand in '23 is a touch lower than it was in first quarter of '22. Could be an indicator of the beginning of some economic slowdown, but it's certainly, I think, premature to conclude that. But diesel is maybe not leading the parade quite as strongly as it had been for the last couple of years. Jet demand continues to grow. And it's still below kind of prepandemic levels. China is the place, obviously, as everybody has been paying attention to domestic travel up to nearly 90% of pre-COVID flights in and out of the country still well below that. And we see flights being scheduled. You see indicators that suggest travel will grow. You listen to the airlines, and that certainly seems to be what they anticipate, but that's in progress. So that's a kind of a quick look across the product slate. I think margins reflect a couple of things. One, a year ago, we were in a period of recovering economies and we're coming out of a period of rationalizing refining capacity around the world. And you can go to any part of the world and find refineries that had shut down that perhaps people expected would close one day, but it happens relatively quickly. And at the same time, you saw big growth projects that had been deferred because of the uncertainty relative to COVID a year later here.  You don't see refineries closing at the same rate. We've seen refinery startups in the Middle East. We've seen projects here in the U.S. and in Asia as well.  So refining capacity coming into the system demand has moderated a little bit. Margins have come down. They're still stronger than historic margins if you look out over a longer period of time, but trending back down towards mid-cycle. Pretty strong in the U.S., maybe under a little more pressure in Asia, but you got to think about the feedstocks in Asia, where they're coming from, how they're priced and how those markets are working.  So I don't see any big warning signs flashing, but certainly, we're paying close attention to it. John Royall : Very helpful, Mike. Thank you. And then maybe sticking with the downstream, and you mentioned California. Can you just talk about the new regulations in California around the potential for excess profit penalties not sure if that's exactly how to refer to it? But how much does that impact how you think about refining in California and your position in California and maybe the expected impacts on the broader market there? Mike Wirth : Yeah. I'll talk about it, sure. So the bottom line is this is now into a rule-making process. There's no impact right now. And it's into kind of a bureaucratic phase. I think implementation is likely to take quite a while, and it's hard to say exactly how it plays out.  What started as an effort to create a windfall profit tax was unsuccessful because you need two thirds of a vote in the legislature for new tax in California. That then modified into some other forms and ended up moving into the Energy Commission, where there will be a group established that will gather a lot of data and try to assess the profitability of industry again some standard, which I think is yet to be fully articulated. So this is going to take some time. It could potentially result in in some sort of a fine or a penalty for margins or profits above a level, but I can't tell you how it's going to play out because it's -- there's a lot of work to be done there.  I guess the things that I would say are pretty predictable are maybe two. One, there are substantial new reporting requirements, and there's a lot of data we're going to have to produce. We're happy to do that. We'll work closely with the Energy Commission to make sure we get them the information that they're requesting. And then the second is, I don't think this does anything to encourage investment or new supply, which is really what's needed in a marketplace commodity markets to bring prices down on average over time. In fact, I think it runs the risk of doing the opposite of discouraging investment of decreasing supply over time, which if demand does not moderate, will tend to exacerbate volatility and over time probably result in, on average, higher levels of price. So that's about all I know about it at this point, and we'll watch it as it unfolds. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : I'm sorry, we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, guys. This is Kalei on for Doug. So thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the new Permian disclosure. So you guys are forecasting flat royalty volumes. So I'm wondering, as that becomes a smaller part of the production mix, how is the cash margin from that asset affected going forward? Pierre Breber : Well, royalty barrels have essentially an infinite margin. And so I think if you and Doug can do the math is it's a slightly lower percentage than that will be a part offset, but there's lots of other drivers that we're doing to enhance margins. And we've shown return on capital employed near 30% at $60 Brent equivalent for our premium. So it's a high return low-carbon asset and the royalty barrels, as you know, come with virtually no cost, and that's part of the advantage that we have. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. I appreciate that, Pierre. My second question goes to TCO. Just wondering if we can get an update on timing of first oil from the new expansion projects and the dividend magnitude for 2023. Mike Wirth : Yeah. So the expansion project, as I said, there's a lot of turnarounds in activity, both this year and next year. And at our Investor Day, we laid out a bar chart that gave you an idea on production.  The real I think the time, as I said earlier, when you're going to see the production growth will manifest itself in 2024 because the next two years, we've got a lot of these turnarounds, ties, et cetera, in place. So Pierre, you can guide on dividends. Pierre Breber : No change in our affiliate dividend guidance that we shared on the last call of $5 billion to $6 billion for the full year. That includes tinges and our other affiliates. We expect, like last year, a dividend in the second quarter, that will be modest and then a larger dividend in the fourth quarter.  TCO continues to hold more cash on its balance sheet to manage through both completing uncertainty around the project and around transport alternatives -- but that cash will come back over time. It's been performing very well. But we don't give specifics on that by year. It's embedded in our overall affiliate dividend guidance. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate that there's still some turnarounds to work through. But as the production hit a steady state, what do you expect the dividend cadence to look like? Pierre Breber : So as I said, last year, there was in two quarters. This year, again, it will be second quarter and fourth quarter, and we'll just -- it's up to the TCO Board of Directors to make the decisions going forward. Hey, thanks for your questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein : Good morning, guys. Just curious about the pace of rig activity in the Permian. You guys are adding one per quarter this year. Outage to be to support growth next year. I'm just curious, as you continue looking forward into next year, do you need to add four more rigs next year to keep kind of that 10% growth pace? Is it less because you're getting more efficient in the Delaware production I'm just curious how you're thinking about the step-up in activity going forward. Mike Wirth : Yeah. I mean we've pulled rigs down dramatically in 2020, and we didn't want to surge back with everything all at once. And so we entered this year with 10 we expect to exit this year with 14 COOP rigs running. And I think consistent with the longer-term production profile that we've outlined we got a big base business that does have decline underneath it. And so you're going to expect us to add some additional rigs as we move into '24. Josh Silverstein : Got it. And I know there's a lot of activity stepping up across the rest of the kind of Lower 48 Haynesville, DJ. They're a little bit more on the gassier side. I'm curious if you guys are pulling back any activity because there are a little bit more gas from in this price environment. Thanks. Pierre Breber : We've -- we're adding a rig in the Haynesville. We talked about that for a number of years building up to that activity. Gas prices are going to be volatile. And frankly, we need to get developing that resource. We have some offset operators. And so if we don't get after it, it's the time for us to do that.  DJ still has a heavy liquids component, no change in our plans. In fact, the DJ and Argentina are a couple of other areas where we expect production in the second half of the year to be higher where we're increasing a little bit of activity. And again, all of that is within our existing CapEx budget. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Josh. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe first off, just a quick follow-up on -- on the comments earlier on and the question on trading, in the international downstream, your earnings were particularly strong this quarter. And I think in the slides there, there's a $270 million other bar, positive other borrowing chart there. Is that primarily trading? And anything to read on that going forward? Is that something that likely reverses or maybe some clarity there? Pierre Breber : You're right. We referred to it. I would not say it's primarily -- it's a lot of factors, and we pointed out to that. It's consistent with how Mike described our trading business. And as all trading businesses are, it can be variable in future quarters. So it's just one of many factors. It's not primarily, but we wanted to cite it as one of the elements in that other variance. Ryan Todd : Thanks, Pierre. And then maybe on the Permian, if you look back at the Permian you've also -- you obviously talked at the Analyst Day, you talked about a variety of the shifts in the 2023 development plan versus 2022. I think -- and you highlighted similar here to that. I think we appreciate some of the near-term impact -- can you talk at all to what some of the longer-term implications are of the shift to more single bench development adjustments to pacing more shift towards New Mexico, et cetera. Does it have any impact on -- like does the move to increase single bench development have any impact on the productivity or recovery of other zones in the area? Does it change at all how you think about service infrastructure and logistics how you think about resource depth in different parts of the portfolio over the long term? Mike Wirth : Yeah, Ryan, I would say not really. We've always been return seeking. And so this is all about optimizing the return we can get out of this asset over the long haul. We've tried to be thoughtful about surface infrastructure. We've tried to be thoughtful about drilling to keep surface infrastructure fully utilized, not over building it for peaks and then leaving it underutilized for long periods of time. And as we're continuing to learn, the fundamental principles about optimizing return on investment continue to drive all of this activity. So as we learn more about benches about communication, about productivity as technology changes, recovery factors, we will continue to apply all of those learnings. But the real objective remains the same. It's not volume, it's value and returns. Pierre Breber : Ryan, and just as a reminder, the move to more single bench is in the Delaware Basin, right? Midland Basin three quarters is multibench development. Ryan Todd : Thanks, Pierre. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry to go back to the Permian, but I'm going to ask another. I was wondering, and I appreciate all the disclosures are really helpful. But in terms of the non-op component of production, does the proportion stay relatively stable through your forecast period? I think you gave a forecast out to 2027 at the Analyst Day. Does the non-op proportion stay the same? Or do you have more operational barrels between now in '27? Mike Wirth : Yeah. It stays relatively similar, I would say, Jason. We can provide further insights on that as we. There's not a big shift. We're growing activity. As I mentioned earlier, we're adding rigs and you got a pretty big base you're adding in on top of. So those percentages don't move a lot. Jason Gabelman : All right. That's helpful. And then just one accounting question. Depreciation fell decently quarter-over-quarter in upstream. What was that related to? Pierre Breber : Are you looking at it excluding special items or. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. If I look at the quarter-over-quarter Slide 7, Upstream DD&A was positive $345 million. Pierre Breber : Yeah, why don't you follow up with Jake? That could be tied to some exploration activity. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about Namibia. You recently farmed in a few months ago. Could you just walk me through plans for the next 12 months or so what you've got pencilled in? And then I've got a follow-up on something else. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Sure. So we've completed seismic acquisition in Namibia at the end of February, and that's being processed right now. And so I can't really comment any further on that. We certainly are mindful of others who have had certain exploration success in the region, which is encouraging, but we need to do the work on that and then determine what the next steps are, which can include drilling exploration wells. So stay tuned on that as we got more information, we'll share it with you, Biraj. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. And then just on a different topic, cost inflation because more and more, you hear some of the service providers talking about improving pricing and so on. So could you just comment on your latest thoughts and what you're seeing on the cost inflation side outside of the Lower 48? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Sure. So really no change to our mid-single-digit inflation guidance in our current year capital spending. As you note, in the Lower 48, there are some areas where we planned for higher inflation and we're seeing that.  I'll remind you that a lot of what we do in our procurement activities are longer term contracts that are either fixed price or index based. We've got detailed cost models to challenge price increases. We commit volumes to certain things over longer periods of time to try to create a win-win between us and our suppliers.  And so we've not seen some of the cost push through that you would see if you were buying services or commodities inputs on a spot basis or then current basis because we manage that activity differently. For instance, on offshore rigs, we're fully contracted for this year. We came into the year with three rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. They're generally below current market rates.  And so I think we're managing this well. The one thing I would say is given, these kind of index-based contracts, there are periodic reviews where we will reset based on market indicators. And so in the second quarter in certain parts of our business, we'll be going through this with some of our partners, and we'll see some resets on there that will probably reflect a little bit of the inflation that I referred to earlier, that's already built into our plans. But I think we're managing all that within the range that is embedded in the guidance we've given you. Biraj Borkhataria : Thank you very much. Mike Wirth : Thank you, Biraj. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Patrick [ph] on behalf of Neil Dingmann. For my question, it's with respect to Venezuelan exports, I know previously, you made mentioned really no further capital investments in Venezuela. What we're curious to know is there a maximum threshold of exports and sales that you're anticipating out of Venezuela? Mike Wirth : Is -- there a maximum -- I mean it's limited by our position there and the entities that we're involved in and what our portion of that production that we're entitled to market is. We're currently seeing about 100,000 barrels a day of production up from about 50 when the license term changed. That actually go up further this year, maybe another 50% if everything goes well. The rude comes to the U.S., and we're finding a market for the crude. And yeah, it's a six-month license from OPEC, and we have to bear that in mind. So that's why we are proceeding, as you said, which is we've got some past receivables that are being paid from some of these proceeds and there's a lot of relatively straightforward workover and other activity that can help bring production up at -- without major capital commitments. And so that's the current model. We'll see how things unfold and hopefully pointed in a good direction, but it's been a bit of an up and down situation, and we have to -- we just have to take this one step at a time. Unidentified Analyst : It's tough here. I guess just as a follow-up, would there be -- are you exploring that six-month term, are you looking to extend that at all? Or is it too early to be negotiated. Mike Wirth : That's a decision made by the U.S. government. It's not really a negotiation. It's their decision, and it's a policy matter we're asked for input and so we provide input on these things. But for the last several years, these things have had relatively short time lines associated with them.  And so we're in full compliance with all the conditions of the sanctions and intend to stay that way. And we'll just see how the policy making turns out. Pierre Breber : This is Pierre. I'm going to go back to Jason's question. So yeah, lower depreciation is really three drivers. Some of it was the absence of some abandonment accruals that were in the fourth quarter. So you can view those as sort of nonrecurring. And then some of it is due to new rates. So each year, we revised our depreciation rates based on additions to proved reserves, and those rates are a little bit lower. And then, of course, first quarter production was a little bit lower than fourth quarter production. So lower volumes also contributed to that lower depreciation. Jake Spiering : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Thank you, Jake. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this week, we announced several senior leadership changes, including Pierre's plans to retire next year, along with second quarter performance highlights. In a few minutes, Pierre will share more details on our financials, which included return on capital employed greater than 12% for the eighth consecutive quarter and another quarterly record in shareholder distributions of more than $7 billion.  At TCO, we're making good progress with commissioning and pre-start up activities, including introducing fuel gas to new facilities. In the third quarter, we expect mechanical completion for the Future Growth Project and to complete a major turnaround. Cost and schedule guidance is unchanged. Conversion of the field from high-pressure to low-pressure is expected to begin late this year and FGP is on track to start up by mid-next year.  We have unused contingency which gives us confidence that we'll complete the project within the total budget. After completion of these projects, TCO is expected to deliver production greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and generate about $5 billion of free cash flow \u2013 Chevron share at $60 Brent \u2013 in 2025.  Chevron's Permian production set another record in the second quarter, about 5% above the previous quarterly high. We expect next quarter's production to be roughly flat before growing again in the fourth quarter, on track with our full-year guidance. Early 2023 well performance in our company-operated assets, in all three areas, is consistent with our plans. In New Mexico, we've put on production at 10 wells. Before year-end, we expect to POP an additional 30 wells with higher expected production rates. As a reminder, about half of Chevron's Permian production is company operated, with the balance non-operated and royalty production.  While short-term well performance is one measure, we're focused on maximizing value from our unique, large resource base that is expected to deliver decades of high-return production. Over the next five years, we expect to develop over 2,200 net new wells, growing production while delivering return on capital employed near 30% and free cash flow greater than $5 billion in 2027 at $60 Brent.  Longer term, we've identified well over 6,000 economic net well locations that support a plateau greater than 1 million barrels per day through the end of next decade. Our deep resource inventory and advantaged royalty position allow us to optimize our development plans for high returns, incorporating learnings and technology improvements, as we expect to deliver strong free cash flow for years to come.  In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the floating production unit at Anchor is on location and the project remains on track for first oil next year. We continue to build on our exploration success and were awarded the highest number of blocks in the most recent lease round. In the Eastern Med, our Aphrodite appraisal well in Cyprus met our expectations and we've submitted a development concept to the government. At Leviathan, we're expanding pipeline capacity to nearly 1.4 BCF per day. We expect to close our acquisition of PDC Energy in August after their shareholder vote next week. Our teams are working on integration plans and we look forward to welcoming PDC's talented employees to Chevron.  Now, over to Pierre. Pierre Breber : As Mike said, strong, consistent financial performance enabled Chevron to return record cash to shareholders this quarter, while also investing within our CapEx budget and paying down debt.  Working capital lowered cash flow primarily due to true-up tax payments outside the US. Excluding tax payments, working capital movements are variable. Our typical pattern in the second half of the year is to draw down working capital.  Chevron's net debt ratio ended the quarter at 7%, significantly below the low end of our guidance range. Surplus cash on the balance sheet was reduced during the quarter, with cash balances ending at $9.6 billion, well above the cash required to run the company.  Adjusted second quarter earnings were down $5.6 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted Upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations, partly offset by higher liftings. Other includes primarily favorable tax items and income from Venezuela non-equity investments.  Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower refining margins. OpEx was up mainly due to higher transportation costs and the inclusion of REG.  Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $900 million. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower realizations. This was partially offset by higher production in the US and non-recurring tax benefits. Adjusted Downstream earnings were down modestly, lower margins were partially offset with higher volumes. Second quarter oil equivalent production was down about 20,000 barrels per day from last quarter, primarily due to planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of Mexico and downtime associated with the Canadian wildfires. This was mostly offset by growth in the Permian.  Now, looking ahead. In the third quarter, we have a planned turnaround at TCO and a planned pitstop at Gorgon, completed earlier this week. Our full-year production outlook is trending near the low end of the annual guidance range. Since PDC's proxy solicitation on July 7th, we've not been permitted to buy back our shares. After we close the acquisition in August, we plan to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter. We do not expect a dividend from TCO until the fourth quarter. Full-year affiliate dividends are expected to be near the low end of our guidance.  Putting it all together, we delivered another quarter with solid financial results, strong project execution and continued return of cash to shareholders. Our approach is consistent and you can see that in our actions and results.  Back to you, Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines. Operator : Our first question comes from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. John Royall : My first question is on Upstream production. Can you bridge us maybe from the midpoint of your production guidance to the low end that you mentioned in the opening? Sounds like the Permian is on plan. So what pieces have come in below the midpoint of plan to move you to that well end? Michael Wirth : Guidance remains unchanged. We expect to be at the lower end of that. And as we said, Permian production has been strong. The things that Pierre mentioned I think are the key things that we've seen. There's been some impact of fires in Canada that have impacted our ability of, not really our operations per se, we did some evacuations on a precautionary basis, but it was midstream and processing downtime that we weren't able to move our production to market.  And the rest of it is \u2013 oh, and Benchamas too, I guess, is the other one. We have an FPSO in Thailand that had an incident and early in the year was taken off station. And so that's another 10,000 or 11,000 barrels a day net, which is off for the foreseeable future. And so, it's really those two things are the ones that are pushing us down that were both unexpected. John Royall : My next question is just sticking to production, but just drilling in a bit on the Permian. The well results generally look very strong in the first half, but still a bit below 2022 in New Mexico. Maybe you can just update us on what innings you think you're in just in terms of optimizing the single bench developments in New Mexico? Michael Wirth : The thing that I think it's important to bear in mind is that New Mexico type curve we showed there, there are only 10 POPs represented or 10 POPs that we achieved all in the second quarter there. So there's no first quarter POPs. And there's only seven that actually had enough data to make it into the curve you see on the chart. So it's a very thin set of data. We expect 30 more POPs in the second half of this year, so that the bulk of the program is not representative of those curve.  And there's a couple of other things, one that the wells we did POP have had some facility constraints that have limited full productivity. So we actually haven't been able to move all the production due to some third party facility constraints that we faced. And the rest of the program is actually in a different part of the New Mexico portion of the Delaware, where we expect higher productivity. So, it's a combination of things. But I'd caution you not to over-index on a very thin dataset with a lot more data to come in the second half of the year. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : I wanted to just stick with the Permian since we're on that topic. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit just around the mix trend that you're seeing there. And if we disaggregate the productivity a little bit further, you talk about how much of the uplift is coming from gas and NGLS versus oil. And then similarly, as you progress towards your longer term production goals, how you expect the mix in the basin for you to trend oil, gas, NGLs over time. Michael Wirth : Devin, we're still drilling primary benches, so we can optimize the oil cut. Across the basin, our production remains roughly 50% oil, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. We look at all the commodities \u2013 oil, NGLs and gas \u2013 and have our own long term views on prices and markets to run the economics to optimize the returns. And the gas/oil ratio in aggregate has been relatively flat for a number of years. And we don't see it changing a lot. It can vary a little bit in different parts of the basin, but if you take it for our whole portfolio, that 50/25/25 remains a pretty good way for you to think about it. Devin McDermott : I wanted to shift over to TCO. Good to hear the continued positive progress there as we get closer to the finish line. There's a lot of moving pieces over the next year, year-and-a-half as we get the two phases of development online. You give the guidance for the turnaround impact in 3Q. I was wanting to talk a little bit more about how you see the evolution of production into the fourth quarter of this year and then through 2024, as we get to that 2025 run rate. So, shape it a bit for us as we look out over the next few quarters. Michael Wirth : The headline here is no change to cost and schedule. I think that's really important. In the second quarter, we made really good progress. As we said, 98% project completion and commissioning is essentially two-thirds complete. In the second quarter, we achieved mechanical completion of the three GI, gas injection, facilities and got fuel gas into the flare system, which is very important to enable an on-time startup of FTP.  In the quarter that we're in now, the third quarter, we expect full mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project and, also, a turnaround at one of the Komplex Technology Lines, or KTLs, will begin a lot of work and start up on utility systems, boilers, steam system, other utilities that are required for startup of the pressure boost facility, which is the key driver of WPMP, which enables us to convert from high pressure to low pressure across the field. Once that turnaround is done in the third quarter and you will see some production impact. I think Jared guided to that. We expect to have two of the four big pressure boost compressors online, which allows us to begin the conversion of metering stations from high pressure to low pressure. And that will initiate \u2013 we'll get that started at the end of this year. It'll take 10 to 12 months for all of those conversions to occur. There will be turnarounds next year as well, two more turnarounds, one at SGI and another one in one of the KTLs. And all of that is part of a very carefully choreographed sequencing of turnarounds and startup activity that will bring the full field, so the 1 million barrels a day for 2025.  So, as we indicated at our Investor Day, what you're going to see in 2023 and 2024 is the normal turnaround activity interlaced with all of this project startup activity. This is not as simple as bringing on a new portion of the field. We're really reworking the entire gathering and producing capacity of the field. And so, it's quite a complex series of activities to execute all of that. And so, the production reflects that. And we put, I think, a chart to kind of give you some guidance for both this year and next year. Jake Spiering : Slide 10 from our set has annual production, 2023, 2024, 2025. Yeah, no change in that guidance. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : I want to stay on TCO. And while there will be a volume inflection in 2025, there's probably going to be a free cash flow inflection in 2024, just as affiliate CapEx rolls off first. And so, can you talk about the cadence of that and how it manifests itself in terms of dividends? Pierre Breber : Yeah, we've been guiding \u2013 Neil, this is Pierre \u2013 to the clean year because that's the $5 billion of free cash flow, $60 Brent in 2025. And, of course, we're guiding to free cash flow, because as you recall, it's not just dividends, it's also repayment of the loans and the co-lending that we have done along the way. And the profile of those loans are disclosed in our SEC filings.  Exactly to your point, you'll see a build towards that just as the CapEx has rolled off. It was not that long ago we were investing $3 billion to $4 billion a year our share into the project and that's down to $1.5 billion or so this year and will continue to trend down. So there's that inflection point.  What's also being managed, of course, are commodity prices and those vary. And as we've said, TCO continues to be conservative in managing its balance sheet, so it's been holding more cash on the balance sheet. As the project gets closer to the end, as we've demonstrated that TPC is running very reliably now for almost a year-and-a-half, we expect some of that cash to come on.  So I can't get in front of the board of directors of TCO. It's a separate company that we are a shareholder in. But we expect, as we said, a much bigger dividend in the fourth quarter than we saw in 2Q. And we expect to see a release of some of that surplus cash that's been held on the balance sheet. And that'll continue over the next couple of years as we head into that $5 billion of free cash flow in 2025.  And maybe the last thing, Neil, you know that TCO has really good price sensitivity. So I've seen yours and other estimates, at 70% or 80%, the cash flow is even stronger. Neil Mehta : The follow-up is just on the return of capital. I think while you have a big buyback range, a lot of market participants have kind of viewed your $17.5 billion dollars as the P50 outcome in any reasonable commodity price environment. And so, thinking less of it like a flywheel and more as sort of a relatively fixed number unless commodity prices go wacky. Just any thoughts on that statement and whether you're trying to give us a little bit more surety around that number as opposed to a more volatile number. Pierre Breber : The range, Neil, is tied to the upside/downside cases that we showed at our Investor Day, roughly, right? So, there's $10 billion to $20 billion. So you're right. It's a wide range because it reflects a wide range of prices between that upside case and the downside case. And of course, in between, there's a sort of a mid-cycle case. And as a reminder, that downside case gets to $50 in a couple of years and stays there for three years. So that is a real downside case. And that's what the low end of the buyback range is notionally tied to. The upside case is a case that's not too different from what we're seeing now. It averages about $85 over the five year period. It trends down to $70 towards the end of that period. And that's why you're seeing a buyback very close to the top end of the range at the $17.5 billion dollars. So it's certainly a signal that, as we look out over this commodity cycle, and again, we think of the buybacks as being steady across a cycle that we feel good about it. So we said we could do a much larger buyback, but that would be not steady, and we don't want to be procyclical. We're trying to be across the cycle. And so, yes, when we guide on buybacks, we're guiding with the intent of maintaining it for a number of years across the cycle. Michael Wirth : Neil, I would just add, you see in our second quarter results that our net debt remains very, very low. And we've indicated multiple times that we don't have a problem gearing back up and putting more debt on the balance sheet to get back towards the range that we've guided to through the cycle in order to sustain a very steady share repurchase program. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Mike, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about new energies. I think you've been clear from the beginning that build versus buy was part of the consideration in a lot of these businesses. We saw a big CO2 pipeline and EUR company transact recently. So maybe you can talk a little bit about the CCUS business as you view it and why build versus buy is maybe the better choice for Chevron?  Maybe I should get ahead of it with a follow up as maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on Bayou Bend please? Michael Wirth : I'll put those two together actually. Look, we'll do both build and buy, I think, in new energies. I would fully expect us to do that in renewable fuels. We have built a business, but then we also went out and acquired Renewable Energy Group. So I think you'll see both.  Certainly, the Denbury transaction is one that the market somewhat anticipated. And you can presume that multiple market players probably took a look at or had conversations with Denbury.  For us, in CCUS, we look for areas that have good geology or pore space, they're near concentrated emissions and have the right policy support to enable a business. The Gulf Coast has all of these things. And Bayou Bend, we've got about 140,000 acres of permanent CO2 pore space, both onshore and offshore. We've got storage potential there of greater than 1 billion metric tons. In the second half of this year, we're going to drill a strat well in the offshore acreage to further delineate and characterize the subsurface. In the first part of next year, we expect to drill a strat well in the onshore acreage and do the same.  And of course, we're in conversations with a number of customers in that region in the Golden Triangle, up at Mont Belvieu, all the way across the Houston Ship Channel. And we've got term sheets going back and forth. We're in negotiations with a number of different potential customers. The commercial framework for this is still evolving. And we're working on the other pieces you need. So classics, well injection permits. And midstream assets, we've got an RFP out right now, with a number of midstream providers, consistent with the way we have generally approached the midstream. We own assets if they're strategic. If there's a way for us to go to somebody who's in the business of building and operating midstream infrastructure, we certainly look at that as well. So we're putting all the pieces together there for a phased development. We like the Bayou Bend project. And we'll report more. But to your kind of underlying question, we'll build organically and we'll do inorganic, where it makes sense. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : My first one is on portfolio concentration. So at your Analyst Day, you talked about just over $20 billion of free cash flow at $60 a barrel. And looking through today's slides, roughly half of that in the medium term will come from the Permian plus TCO. So I understand that you want every dollar to go to the highest level of return, which is completely sensible. But I was wondering if you can talk about portfolio concentration because it is quite unusual for a super major to have that level of concentration in terms of free cash flow. So how do you think about portfolio diversity? And is this something you're actively trying to address going forward? And I've got a follow-up on a different topic. Michael Wirth : Biraj, if you look back over the last decade, we've cleaned up our portfolio. We had a lot of assets that were kind of at the smaller end of the tail that pulled capital and management time and resources. And we want to be diversified. We've got a diverse portfolio. But we don't need to be diversified just for the sake of it. We want to have assets that have scale, that are material and long lived. You can start in the Far East and look at our LNG positions in Australia, which aren't drawing a lot of capital right now, but are [Technical Difficulty] acquisition in the EG assets that can feed LNG into Europe.  Obviously, you mentioned TCO. The Eastern Med is a very strong position. We've recently taken FID and are working on expansion projects for tomorrow, Leviathan, and have submitted a concept on Aphrodite. So there's a lot of opportunity in that asset.  When we close PDC, we're going to be producing 400,000 barrels a day in the DJ Basin. We've talked about some of our other shale and tight assets in Argentina, in Canada. We've got two crackers underway in CPChem that will come online middle of this decade, one in the US, one in the Middle East. We've acquired REG and are growing our renewable fuels business.  So we have exposure across a large portfolio. And then, of course, we also have projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico. I mentioned Anchor earlier, Whale, Ballymore. And we recently acquired more leases in this recent lease sale than the \u2013 twice as many leases as in the biggest lease sale over the last eight years. So we're adding to our position in the Gulf of Mexico.  So this idea that we're a two asset company, the Permian and TCO, I don't think really stands up to careful inspection. They're two great assets, and so they get a lot of attention, but we've got a lot of other strong assets in our portfolio. Pierre Breber : If I can just build off that and go to the return of capital question that Neil asked and that's what gives us confidence not only on the buyback, but on the track record of dividend growth. So, we guided to 10% annual free cash flow coming from all those businesses. Some are holding cash constant, some are growing cash flow that Mike covered. And that goes to leading dividend growth where we've grown the dividend over the last five years at rates double our closest peer and much higher than others, and where we have a buyback that is nearly 6% of our shares outstanding annually. Our business is built for $50. So part of the confidence in our ability \u2013 currently, if you look at our breakeven and adjust for working capital this quarter, if you look at the last four quarters, it's actually probably a little bit lower than that with the strong refining margins that we've been seeing. So we're built for lower prices. Free cash flow is going to grow from this base. That should give investors confidence in our ability to continue to grow the dividend at leading rates and to maintain buybacks at also very high rates. Biraj Borkhataria : Just following up on a different question. Through the Permian, you'll be producing a lot more gas over time and you have expressed a desire to grow in LNG. So, you've signed a couple of deals as an offtaker to synthetically integrate your US gas position to global markets. I wanted to ask about the sort of \u2013 whether you'd be interested in owning liquefaction or whether you feel being an offtaker is enough because some of your peers have argued the benefits of integration and owning through the value chain. But I think in the past, you've noticed the returns are typically lower. And I'm particularly interested in asking that question now because a number of players have signed offtake agreements with companies such as Venture Global, and then actually they're not receiving the gas as agreed. So it's interesting how you're thinking about that sort of value chain in LNG. Michael Wirth : It's consistent with what we've described earlier, and I think you've captured it. It depends on the circumstance. In places where you've got remote gas where you need to be in the entire value chain and you can create an economic model that supports the investments, we've done that. In other locations where you've got other people that will put capital into the midstream assets, we can sell gas into that, we can offtake gas off of it, but not participate in some of the very capital intensive and lower return portions of the value chain. That's certainly a model that helps us support our aspiration to drive higher returns. Now you have to have good partners, you have to have reliable operations, and we'll work closely with the companies that we have offtake with. We vet them carefully and we have confidence in the people that we are working with to provide those reliable operations, but we're really looking to drive high returns, not necessarily to own assets for the sake of control unless it creates a differentiated value proposition. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : The question is on the cash balance. It looks like, nominally, it's drawn down, but it feels there's some inputs that would theoretically help it rebuild in the second half. You've got working capital and I think TCO is going to pay a dividend in third quarter. And PDC had a very front loaded capital program too. So, that's coming on with free cash flow. So just wondering about the cash balance and how you think about the level or if we're going to be in a rebuild phase for 2H? Pierre Breber : Well, the direction that it goes depends, of course, on commodity prices and margins and a number of other factors. You're right, our cash levels have come down, in part due to working capital outflows, timing of affiliate dividends. And we've also paid down some debt. We've been, I think, very clear that we don't want to hold surplus cash, certainly not permanently, that it's where the cash goes in the short term. But, over time, that cash is going to be returned to our shareholders in the form of this growing dividend and ratable buyback program. So we need only about $5 billion to support our operations. We're nearly $10 billion at the end of the second quarter. So that's more than sufficient. We have access to lots of liquidity. We don't have any commercial paper now. Again, we've been paying down debt. So that's the more economically efficient way to manage the balance sheet if we get there. And whether the balance the cash balance goes up or down again depends on all the inputs and outputs that we've been showing.  We're guiding towards the net debt, as Mike said. The net debt is well below the low end of our guidance range. So, we look at all those factors. And again, if cash balances head down to $5 billion, that'll be adequate to cover the operations. On working capital, our pattern the second half of the year is that we tend to see some draws on it. But we're certainly not going to recover from what we've seen this first half of the year. A big portion of what we saw in the first half of this year on working capital are really tax payments tied to earnings last year. So you can kind of think of those as being offset from last year where we had that favorable working capital environment.  So, there'll be ups and downs along the way. Over time, working capital tends to average out over zero. But these are just timing effects. We look through them. We knew we had taxes due. And so, that's all part of the planning as we look at the balance sheet. Jake Spiering : Sam, I guess that we've guided to a TCO dividend in the fourth quarter. We do not expect a dividend in the third quarter. Sam Margolin : Sorry, I must have misread that remark. The follow up is actually sort of on the organization. It's a follow-up to Steve's question earlier. But Pierre had spent some time in an ESG role and the low carbon role. And the incoming CFO is coming from a role where there was a lot of work on the ground on the low carbon front, on the technology side. And so, Chevron has this really interesting sort of marriage between finance and low carbon that I think is differentiated when you look at some of the peers. And so, the question is, as we make progress through the low carbon development, do you feel like you're embedded in the highest return areas? Or are there other ones where capital is going to maybe pivot? And I think that ties into carbon capture too because that seems like a place where the incentives are pretty transparent? Michael Wirth : I think your question started with people and ended up at our kind of investment priorities in new energies. Look, across the entire leadership team, we've got a commitment to driving higher returns and lower carbon, and people move through different kinds of roles. But this is part of every role in the company today. So, it's a part of the business, it's something we're committed to.  Our focus is, as we've said before, it's on things where we can leverage our unique capabilities, assets, value chains, customers, to create sustainable, competitive advantage in these new energy businesses. It's why we've not gone into wind and solar on a merchant basis because there's others that can do that and we don't want to really bring anything unique there.  Our renewable fuels business today is profitable and generating cash. We expect to start up the Geismar expansion and be producing more renewable diesel next year. So, that's a business today that is economic and attractive, and we continue to grow, particularly back into the feedstock side. We announced an acquisition this last quarter of a small company that's got some interesting feedstock technology. Carbon capture and storage, obviously, is being built. We do it today in some assets. But as a business, we're building out Bayou Bend. I talked about, we're working on projects in other parts of the world as well. And we do believe that, with the right technology, the right business model and policy environments that there is an opportunity there.  Other things that we're working on, hydrogen is one that's both electrolytic hydrogen and then traditional hydrogen paired with carbon capture and storage. In the US, the IRA incentives can certainly support the development of business models there. So I think we'll stay consistent with this. We're always looking at new technologies, but the area we focused on is the primary area you should expect to see us investing. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I'd like to go back to the Permian detail for a minute, if I could, and kind of two questions on this. First, has CapEx in the Permian deviated at all from that $4 billion budget that you highlighted at the Analyst Day. And the second part, on the Permian inventory over the five year plan and long term, what percentage of those locations would you categorize as tier one? Michael Wirth : Jason, Permian CapEx is up a little bit this year. Primarily three things. Number one, we've actually seen our drilling performance continue to improve and completions performance continue to improve. So out of the same fleet of rigs and completion spreads, we're getting more work done, which means you consume more tubulars, more sands, more water, et cetera. So, that's kind of a good thing. We're seeing some longer lead times on some of the critical elements in facilities. And so, we've actually had to make some long lead purchases for next year's program that we didn't anticipate as we were lining up this year's program. And then, we've increased facility scope for water handling in some areas of the Permian, particularly as we're trying to manage some of these induced seismicity issues. We're being more and more careful removing more water. And so, that has all led to some increase in CapEx. Not a lot of inflation there. The inflation has been largely in line with what we had expected and the rig fleet is being activated in line with what we expected.  Your second question on inventory, we haven't broken our portfolio into tiers. There's not a very clear definition of that and a way to kind of do that on a standard basis. So when we've outlined the drilling locations and the long term guidance there, it's really based on economics. And we've got locations that are economic at our price view for the future, which has historically not been a super aggressive price view. It's based on today's technology. And as indicated, we've got more than 6,000 locations in that outer time window that are economic based on those assumptions. By the time we get to that window, we may or may not see a different price environment. I fully expect we'll see a different technology environment, which can allow that number to grow even further. So we look at it more in terms of the economics of the development than tiers. Jason Gabelman : My follow-up, just going back to TCO, you made some comments on kind of maintenance effects over the next four quarters. And I know you showed it graphically, but are you able to quantify the actual impact to our production over the next four quarters from all these turnarounds and startup activities? Pierre Breber : Jason, we do it quarterly. Like, it's included in the third quarter guidance that we provided. And we'll continue to do that quarterly and you're seeing sort of annually. We're giving annual guidance on TCO. So it's all embedded in there. I think we showed it relative to 2022. But there's just a lot of moving parts. But we'll continue to give that guidance each quarter and you have annual guidance that incorporates all of that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Irene Himona : My first question is on the Downstream, please, if you can talk around the performance of your chemicals affiliates, in particular in Q2 and then what you're seeing so far in the third quarter. And then, also what you would expect in terms of refining margin evolution in the second half of the year, given the weakness in Q2. Michael Wirth : The chemicals business is cyclical, as everybody knows. We're certainly in a period now where we're seeing some length in supply due to newbuild facilities. There's some length there that's weighed on margins in the olefins chain. And in the short term, we think we're going to continue to see that be a pretty tough sector. Longer term, as you get out to mid-decade and beyond, demand will continue to grow. And we expect demand and supply will come into better balance, and we'll see those margins recover out towards the middle and second part of this this decade.  Your second question, I'm sorry I was thinking about chemicals there. Refining margins, yeah. Certainly, we've seen refining margins come off the very strong levels that they were at last year. There's been some new capacity come into the system around the world, some big new refineries that have begun to start up or major projects that have come online, and so margins have softened year-on-year.  Certainly, the West Coast in our portfolio is important. West Coast margins, both in the refining and the marketing part of the value chain, have held up a little bit better because it's a market that is a little bit more cut off from the rest of the world than the Gulf Coast or Asia. And so, demand continues to be pretty strong out there.  Our gasoline demand is strong. Jet demand continues to come back. Diesel demand has maybe flattened out a little bit, but certainly holding. And so, we're in an environment where I would expect inventories towards the lower end of the products in a number of parts of the world. I think refining margins for the second half of this year are likely to be as good as they were in the first half of the year at least. Irene Himona : Based on that, following your FID for the pipeline in Israel, I was wondering, is that it for the time being for Leviathan? Or do the partners continue to examine other options like FLNG, for example? Michael Wirth : Yes, we continue to evaluate other options. In fact, we're working towards a concept select for the next expansion of Leviathan, ideally, at the end of this year, and floating LNG is one of the concepts that we continue to look at. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe if I could follow up on some earlier Permian conversations. You talked a little bit about some of the New Mexico well performance. But on well performance overall that you disclosed, it appears that first half results are showing improved performance across much of the basin, as you expected. What have you seen to date in terms of addressing some \u2013 I know you don't have a lot of data, but in terms of addressing some of the concerns from last year? Particularly, what have you learned regarding spacing, single versus multi bench approach, et cetera, on the wells that you've done so far this year? Michael Wirth : The performance is really consistent with our expectations and what we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year, Ryan. There are a couple of things just to remember. I mentioned earlier that, in New Mexico, we saw some infrastructure and third party constraints, and you can have that \u2013 we've got that in some other parts of our portfolio as well. So there are things that will show up on these curves that are not necessarily \u2013 just a reflection of the geology and the well performance.  And as we continue to change our development strategy on well spacing, profit loading, well length, et cetera, those will continue to be reflected in these curves. The thing that is really important is production \u2013 we put production out there because everybody likes to see it. We're not optimizing the production. We're optimizing the returns. And so, fluid mix, EUR, capital investments are all important parts of what we're optimizing to. It's harder for you to see all the things that we're looking to optimize to drive returns when you're just looking at production.  The high level answer is performance in line with the expectations as we've continued to evolve our program. Ryan Todd : Maybe if we turn to the Gulf of Mexico, as we think about your Gulf of Mexico deepwater portfolio, you've got an impressive string of project startups coming over the next few years. How exposed are you to escalating trends in deepwater drilling and development costs? As you look across those projects, do you have costs locked in across some of those projects, rigs under multi-year contracts, et cetera? I guess, how much are you able to mitigate cost escalation as we think over kind of CapEx requirements over the next few years? Pierre Breber : Yeah, those projects were contracted at a different time. So they reflect mostly locked in rates, as you'd expect. Procurements well behind us as we're getting \u2013 as projects are pretty far along. So new exploration activities, we'll get exposed to some of the higher rig rates on that, but for the existing major capital projects, that's largely locked in. Michael Wirth : We came into the year with three rigs under contracts that were contracted back in a different environment. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Maybe two questions, if I could. One, you're talking about you submit a development plan in Cyprus discovery? Can you give us a little bit in terms of the timeline? What should we expect? And also, what is the preliminary design of the development that's going to look like and the scale? And what kind of time that it's going to see the first oil?  The second question that you haven't talked much about, Argentina. And, over there, the government seems to be pretty excited with shale oil development. And you have a position there. Can you give us an update? What is your thinking over there? Michael Wirth : Paul, in Cyprus, we're pleased with the outcome of the recent appraisal well. We've submitted our development plan to the government for their approval and it involves a capital efficient way to take the gas to market via subsea tiebacks to existing infrastructure. But this is all pending government approval. If we get that, we could be into FEED later this year. But it's a little early for us to really lay anything out on first gas. So as we get through the government approval process, we'll get back to talk to you about the timeline on that one. On Argentina, we remain very positive on the resource there. There's an election coming up. The country's got its some kind of macroeconomic challenges that it's facing right now. But we like the block, particularly our El Trapial area where we're doing some more development work now with some increased capital that flows with that. We'll talk to you about that at Investor Day and beyond. But no real changes there. It's going to be part of the growth story. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : My first question is on the Permian ratability. It looks like you've got about a couple of hundreds POPs this, wells to sales. 2,000 over the next five years. Is that ratable? How should we think about the step up in activity? Pierre Breber : Just one thing, the coop POPs is 200. But if you were to include net POPs, again, half of our portfolio is non-op and royalty, it'd be more like 300. So it looks more consistent. The long term plateau in the well inventory, the 2,200 over the next five years, incorporates all of the activity and the POP data was just on company operated. So there is some increase, but not as large as it looks. You've just get it apples to apples. Doug Leggate : They're fairly ratable, Pierre? Like, 500 a year type of deal or 400 a year type of deal. Pierre Breber : As we get up to activity, and as Mike said, we're becoming more efficient as are other operators that we work with. Yeah, it's going to be pretty ratable once we get up to our full rate activity. Michael Wirth : Of course, Doug, quarter to quarter, there's some variability as we saw first quarter to second quarter this year. The third quarter is going to be a little \u2013 so there can be some surges and plateaus quarter to quarter, but on an annual basis, yeah, it's going to be pretty ratable. Doug Leggate : My follow-up, guys, is on Tengiz, but it's a slightly different question. I guess Pierre and I are similar vintage, the same Tengiz in 1993. It expires six years after the end of your Analyst Day trajectory through 2027 and it's a quarter of your free cash flow. So, my question is, what are your options there, whether it be extended or replaced? And perhaps maybe some color on what the production profile looks like post 2027 [indiscernible] going into fairly severe decline after 2030? So, just want to know what you're thinking about the long term sustainability of those free cash flows? Michael Wirth : The concession is a decade away. We're focused on delivering the project right now. This is a big, complex asset, a big, complex project. We'll certainly be in discussions with the government over time about potential extension of this. It'll reflect what we see in terms of reservoir performance and production opportunities out into the future. These concession discussions have to create value for the country and for Chevron. So we've got to find something that works for both parties. We've walked away from concessions, as you've covered extensively, Doug, where it didn't work for us, in places like Indonesia and Thailand. We've extended in places like Angola where it did. So we'll be talking more about that over time. But, right now, we're really focused on project execution and delivering FTP. Operator : Our last question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess my first question for you, with the extension of your tenure, are you willing to share with us what some of the things you're hoping to get done and the extra time will be, or maybe what some of the real opportunities are here that you'd like to shepherd through? Michael Wirth : Roger, it's been a pretty turbulent first part of my tenure with a major restructuring, a pandemic and oil prices that collapsed, a war and oil prices that spiked, the political and geopolitical noise that comes with those things, the ongoing climate and ESG issues, three acquisitions, one of which we still haven't closed. And so, I'm actually looking forward to a little smoother water, I hope one day.  And, look, we still got work to do to continue to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And so, it's to continue that work. We've got good momentum in our business. We've delivered strong results through all of that turbulence and have maintained strong shareholder distributions throughout and strategic consistency throughout where we've seen others in the industry buffeted around a little bit by these horses. And so, I'd like to continue that and to drive more value to our shareholders and higher returns and lower carbon. Roger Read : I commend you for not trying to duck out when things finally look good for at least a short time. My follow-up question is really much more on the modeling front. If we look at your realizations on oil, they were much stronger here in the second quarter. I think that contributed to some of the outperformance. But what we really saw was a dip Q1 and an improvement Q2, kind of back in line with traditional. So, I was just wondering, as we think about \u2013 was that a timing issue, a regional issue, first quarter, and anything we should be thinking about as we look at your realization or capture on oil prices going forward? Pierre Breber : Roger, our view that \u2013 not quite picked that up. So why don't you follow up with Jake after the call and make sure we understand your question, and we'll do our best take on it. But our oil realizations have looked good and our natural gas realizations have looked strong. We had better timing in the first quarter. So if you look quarter-on-quarter on some of our international gas, it might seem a little weaker, but not sure on liquid. So, please follow up with Jake. Jake Spiering : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation in today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Chevron second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Thanks, Jake. I want to start by acknowledging the tragic events in the Middle East. We are deeply saddened by the loss of life, and our hearts go out to those affected by the war. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees and their families and the safe delivery of natural gas. Earlier this week, we announced that Chevron entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hess Corporation. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2024. And we look forward to providing updates in the future. Now turning to the third quarter. We continued to make progress on our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon by returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivering ROCE greater than 12% for the ninth consecutive quarter; and investing in traditional energy by closing the PDC Energy acquisition and in new energies by acquiring a majority stake in a green hydrogen production and storage hub in Utah. And earlier this month, we released our Climate Change Resilience Report which details our approach, actions and progress in reducing carbon intensity and growing new, lower carbon businesses. I encourage everyone to read the report, available on Chevron.com. At TCO, base business continues to deliver good results. The planned turnaround was completed ahead of schedule, the reservoir is performing well and the plant remains full. We expect a higher dividend in the fourth quarter. TCO has achieved mechanical completion at the Future Growth Project. Following slower-than-expected commissioning progress, we conducted an independent cost and schedule review. We now forecast the Wellhead Pressure Management Project, which is the field conversion from high pressure to low pressure, to begin start-up in the first half of 2024 and to continue through two major train turnarounds. FGP is expected to start-up in the first half of 2025 and ramp to full production within three months. Total project cost is expected to increase between 3% to 5%. TCO production on a 100% basis in 2024 is forecasted to be about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower than 2023 due to a heavier turnaround schedule and planned downtime for WPMP conversions. TCO is expected to reach greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025 when FGP fully ramps up. Free cash flow from TCO in 2025 is expected to be more than $4 billion, Chevron's share at $60 Brent, down around $1 billion from our prior estimate. Our focus remains on safe and reliable commissioning and start-up. I'll now turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter with strong earnings, cash flow and ROCE. This quarter's results included two special items : a one-time tax benefit of $560 million in Nigeria and pension settlement costs of $40 million. Foreign currency benefits were $285 million. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Organic CapEx this quarter included about $200 million for PDC legacy operations after closing in August. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio in the single digits. Another quarter of solid cash flow enabled us to deliver on all of our financial priorities. Despite restrictions during the PDC transaction, we were able to repurchase well over $3 billion in Chevron shares. Cash used to reduce debt was primarily related to PDC's higher cost borrowing. Cash balances ended the quarter near $6 billion, a little above what's needed to run our businesses. Adjusted third quarter earnings were down $5.1 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and negative timing effects. Higher unfavorable discrete tax charges and exploration expenses were partly offset by lower DD&A, Venezuela cash recoveries and other favorable items. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to a negative swing in timing effects and lower marketing margins. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down just over $50 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were roughly flat as higher prices and volumes were offset by unfavorable discrete tax charges and negative timing effects due to the rise in prices. DD&A and OpEx were both higher in part due to the addition of PDC legacy assets for two months in the quarter. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by unfavorable timing effects. All other was down on unfavorable tax items and decreased interest income in line with lower cash balances. Third quarter oil equivalent production was up 6% over last quarter primarily due to two months of legacy PDC production. This was partly offset by a planned turnaround at TCO and pitstop at Gorgon. The Permian, excluding legacy PDC, was down 2% due to lower non-operated production; company-operated production was flat with the second quarter. Now, looking ahead. Our fourth quarter estimate for turnarounds and downtime includes approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Tamar. We anticipate affiliate dividends in the fourth quarter to be largely from TCO. As a reminder, we record a 15% withholding tax on TCO dividends. Due to the pending transaction with Hess, share repurchases will be restricted pursuant to SEC regulations. Chevron expects share repurchases in the fourth quarter to be around $3 billion plus or minus 20%, depending primarily on the timing of the Hess definitive proxy statement mailing. In summary, our actions and performance show that Chevron keeps delivering strong results. With a strategy that remains clear and consistent, we are well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. With that, I'll turn it back to Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. To allow for questions from more participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping we could dig into the international upstream, just a little short on what we were expecting this quarter, what some of the factors were, other than the ones called out, the FX issue and the tax benefit in Nigeria. Michael Wirth : Yes, Roger. Look, I'll let Pierre cover this in a little more detail, but there's \u2013 I recognize this quarter was a tough one to model. And there's pretty material or significant non-cash charges. Timing effects, primarily inventory costs, we see with rising prices some tax reserves and charges for legal abandonment and other things and then some lower realizations with your mix and the lag effect in some of our LNG pricing. On timing and inventory costs in particular, on period-to-period comparisons where we had a prior period, whether it was last quarter or the same quarter last year, where prices were coming down and then in the current period, we see prices strengthening significantly, you really get pretty significant deltas on the way we cost inventory. And if you go back to the, I think, the first quarter of 2022, we had some similar dynamics. So anyway, that's kind of high level on it. Pierre, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the upstream and international upstream in particular. Pierre Breber : Yes, it's a subset of what you talked to, Mike, Roger. So timing effects, the largest timing effects this quarter were on cargoes on the water. So you'll see that primarily in the international upstream, international downstream. Timing effects are in three buckets. You have paper mark-to-market, you have on-the-water inventory and then you have on-land inventory. So it's really cargoes on the water that drive most of the effect, cargoes that are in transit and cross over quarterly periods. And so that's what the trajectory of prices, as Mike indicated, is really what drives that. Mike talked about abandonment estimate. So those will show up in depreciation. And we saw that in the international upstream. And then in LNG, you see some lag pricing. We also saw some mix between contract cargoes and spot cargoes on LNG. And on the liquid side, we saw some mix effects. So it's a bit of where the liftings are relative to production in terms of tax jurisdictions, the types of products, how they trade in terms of discounts to Brent. So there were a number of items in international upstream. And you could follow-up, Roger, with Jake and cover any more details. Roger Read : No, thanks. I'll sum it up as messy. I appreciate it. Thanks. Michael Wirth : We gave [indiscernible] quarter every now and again. Go ahead, Katie. Operator : I apologize. We'll take our next question from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Joshua Silverstein : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. On the TCO, you had mentioned that in 2025, you expect the cash flow to be about $1 billion lower, around $4 billion versus $5 billion previously. Is that just due to the project delays? Or is there higher cost estimates now in that, so it would be lower distributions from there? Or is there something else that's driving that? Michael Wirth : Yes. So Josh, there's going to be some more capital, we said 3% to 5%. So think about around $1 billion Chevron share over 2024 and 2025, probably a little more weighted to 2024 than 2025. Cash flow from the operations will be lower by about $1.5 billion at $60 Brent in total over the next two years really due to the delay in the project. So it's equivalent to about 50,000 barrels a day in net production in each of those years. So in total, we expect our share of dividends to be lower by about $2.5 billion across 2024 and 2025 from the prior guidance. And so it's a combination of those things. And so we had previously guided to above $5 billion. We're now seeing above $4 billion and a little more of that coming from production and cash flow from ops as opposed to CapEx. Pierre Breber : And the delay in WPMP doesn't have any impact really because there was no incremental production. So the effects that Mike was talking about in production are really from the delay in the start-up of FGP, which obviously adds incremental production. Michael Wirth : Thank you, Josh. Joshua Silverstein : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thank you. I just want to stay on the TCO question. As you think about, Mike, the biggest gating factors to getting from here to completion around FGP, just walk us through the landscape and the key milestones that you'll be watching and we should be watching to give us conviction that the project is coming into service. Michael Wirth : Yes. So the main message here, Neil, is as we completed both WPMP and then mechanical completion of FGP and we've begun to get deep into the commissioning, we've, I think, previously mentioned we worked with some technical issues with our utility systems. And as we did that and we saw some of these impacts, we commissioned an independent cost and schedule review off cycle. We normally do these annually, but we didn't want to wait. And so as we saw some of this evidence that things were going slower, there were some more discovery work, we sent in an independent team to give us kind of a cold eyes assessment on cost and schedule. And I think the main thing that I would distill that down to is the recommendations from that and that are embedded in our updated guidance today reflect a more conservative forecast of commissioning progress. And so we're assuming things will take longer than the prior plan. We're assuming we're going to have discovery items that tend to come up in complex projects like this. And in response, we've implemented some significant changes in terms of how we're approaching this. We've moved contract resources over from 3GI, which is a portion of the Future Growth Project, which is now completed and fully commissioned over onto the other commissioning work. So we've added contract resources there. We brought in experienced turnaround and operations people that are very skilled in the discovery work, in managing through the restart of and operations of facilities now to help us with this. And then we've also added technical resources to address any unplanned discovery items that would come up. So we've had a significant change in our approach to this. We've got a more conservative guidance here that we're issuing now. And we'll continue to talk about this every quarter. I guess, the main things to look at here are we've got big compressor trains that will start up for pressure boost, which is a key driver of this high-pressure to low-pressure conversion. These are very large machines. And so those are key milestones. After that, we've got metering stations that are converted from high pressure or low pressure. And so over the next few quarters \u2013 and there's, I think, 40-some-odd metering stations as you go out through the entire field. We've got these two big turnarounds that I've talked about. All of those are really key milestones that we'll be tracking very closely. And we'll update you on those as we go forward. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just stick with upstream, but actually ask about Venezuela. You've had some increase in production year-over-year, given the initial sanction relief. And there's obviously been some additional sanction relief announced just since the last quarterly call. I think you might have been on an interview this morning. You made some comments that you could see a sequential increase in production between now and year-end. I was wondering if you could just step back, talk through what impact this sanction relief has on your production profile and also willingness to invest in that region. And can you remind us how impactful Venezuela volumes are for your corporate cash flow? Michael Wirth : Sure. So yes, we have seen some action now from the U.S. government. We had been previously operating under an OFAC license, which was modified at the beginning of this year, a general license. There's some specific licenses that go with that, that define the terms under which we can operate. The recent action in the new general license issued by OFAC really kind of opens up operating room for others more so than it does for us. We already \u2013 it doesn't materially change our circumstances here. And so I think what you'll see is some more people lifting crude, bring it to the \u2013 you'll see more crude flow to the U.S. I don't think the \u2013 the impact on our operations really is not particularly significant. We are up to something around 130,000 barrels a day from maybe 60,000 barrels a day earlier this year. We still think we can get to 150,000 or so by year-end. So we are seeing improvements and expect there's some more that we can see through the balance of the year. And that's driving \u2013 the cash from that is going to pay legitimate operating expenses, tax and royalties, recover some past dues that we are owed. And we're really working on what I would call pretty straightforward field maintenance and things to restore production that aren't particularly long cycle or capital-intensive and staying within the kind of cash that's being generated from those sales in order to fund that. I would expect that's the posture we'll remain in for a while here until we see how the longer-term sanctions environment plays out, the political situation in the country with elections and the like and continue to make progress on recovery of the past dues that I mentioned. And so not a lot of change, I guess, I would say, from our point of view. Pierre, maybe you want to comment on the cash and production. Pierre Breber : Yes. Consistent with what Mike just said, we're continuing to do cost affiliate accounting, which means we are not \u2013 we don't record production or reserves, right? So that's not reflected in our numbers. And we only record earnings when we receive cash. So we're not \u2013 we're recording a proportionate share of equity earnings, but only what we actually receive in cash. And that's something that we'll continue to look at. And as Mike said, depending on all those potential triggers down the road, elections and such, we could go back to equity accounting at some point in time. But we have not made that decision yet. In terms of cash flow, it's about 1% of our cash flow. So it's modest, of course. But it's more than it was before. And so as Mike said, operations there are continuing well. And we're getting a little bit of cash. And we'll just see where it goes from here. Devin McDermott : Great. Thank you. Michael Wirth : Thank you, Devin. Operator : We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : All right. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sure you get a few more on TCO. I just want to ask about the Permian. Last quarter, you gave some very helpful data points on well productivity this year. I was wondering, particularly for the New Mexico side, if you had any incremental comments for wells driven in the third quarter. Because I know it was a pretty small sample size of POPs in the first half of the year. So any comments there would be helpful. Thank you. Michael Wirth : Yes. And I might give you some kind of broader commentary on Permian performance as well. Overall, production was down just a little bit, about 2% in the quarter. That was entirely driven by non-operated joint ventures. And primarily, a couple of the operators had delays in putting wells online due to frac hits and some other factors. There was also some takeaway capacity on the Permian highway that \u2013 constraints that resulted in some unplanned downtime. So co-op production in the third quarter was essentially flat from the prior quarter, which is what we had guided to. And that's despite having some wells that were choked back due to some surface constraints. In one development area, we're seeing higher-than-expected CO2 content in the gas and others in the area are as well. So we've got third-party handling and process facilities that are constrained by that and can't handle all the CO2. So we're choking wells back. There's a new federal regulation that I won't get into the details. But it affects how we meter production. And it prevents co-mingling. And so we've got wells choked back until we can get some new meters in place. And then we've got some produced water limits that have come into effect in some areas. So there's a number of things that are not indicative of well performance, but other surface realities that we're working on our way through that are impacting co-op production a little bit. In New Mexico, you're right. We got more POPs in the second half of the year. We've POP-ed about 60% of the planned wells in New Mexico. So the balance, almost half, come on in the fourth quarter. POP performance has generally been strong. Some of those wells are hit by the facility constraints that I've talked about. But overall, well performance is aligned with our type curve expectations. I think when we get to the fourth quarter call, Biraj, we'll come back with some more detail on type curves. We'll have enough of them online. We'll have enough months that we can start to give you some of the same kind of evidence that we did last quarter to show you the performance. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Michael Wirth : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Michael Wirth : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : Maybe we'll stick with the U.S. and ask about just the U.S. upstream CapEx number. There's a lot of moving parts in here. You've got incorporation of PDC. You have kind of GOM projects and Ballymore coming into play, inflation and then timing effects that you alluded to. I guess, when you think about this quarter's U.S. upstream capital, how would you characterize it just overall? Would you say it's sort of on plan or like overly influenced by any one of these factors that may or may not be mitigated over time? Thank you. Michael Wirth : Yes. Sam, you're right. I mean, we are seeing pressure in the U.S. And I think we're probably going to end up higher than our budget as we end the year. PDC is being integrated into the factory pretty much as we expected. And so it's an increment because it wasn't in our original plan. But it's really not a driver of this. The big thing is we're seeing actually more feet drilled per rig and more completion feet than we had planned. And so the productivity of the primary development activity has continued to improve. But that means we spend more money on tubulars, on sand, on water than we had anticipated. So it's kind of a good news, but it brings with it some costs. We've got some long lead items, where we're seeing supply chain realities that say we need to place long lead orders earlier. So some things we otherwise would have ordered next year that we've actually moved ordering and initial payments on into this year. So there's some long lead dynamics going on. And then I mentioned earlier, produced water is becoming an issue, the reinjection of that and doing that in a way that minimizes the incidences of induced seismicity. So we've got some more produced water handling infrastructure spend. So I would say those are kind of the primary drivers. And that's pushing the Permian to be a little hot. Gulf of Mexico is pretty well right on plan. And so what you're seeing there is really a function of PDC, which is just an increment that's been added, and then some additional costs in the Permian program that we really hadn't anticipated as we went into the year. Pierre Breber : Hey, I'll just add. So if you take out inorganic, which is $600 million year-to-date, $400 million in the third quarter for \u2013 primarily for ACES and the $200 million that we had for PDC in the third quarter, through third quarter year-to-date, we're about $200 million above the ratable budget. Of course, fourth quarter tends to be higher. So as Mike says, we'll likely end the year a little bit above budget. Sam Margolin : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Michael Wirth : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Mike, can I get back \u2013 can I go back to TCO? It's a little bit of the late stage for the cost increase and everything. I guess the question is that, I mean, what have we learned from this process and to ensure that your future project execution will become better and not facing the kind of problem that, I mean, it has been a challenging project that all along due to a number of different reasons. But quite frankly that this is a bit disappointing at this very last stage for the bit of the slip in the schedule and also the cost increase? Thank you. Michael Wirth : Yes, Paul. Thank you. And look, I share the sentiment. So I understand where you're coming from. Big complex projects, you've been along for the whole ride. So you know early on, there were some engineering issues that we confronted and addressed. In the middle of it, the big thing was the pandemic and demobilizing, remobilizing, building medical facilities and a whole bunch of stuff that we had to manage our way through and was complex and difficult. And our folks did a great job, but it clearly impacted cost and schedule. And the big thing here, Paul, is as we've gotten into \u2013 and you have to remember, this is \u2013 we're redoing the power infrastructure for the entire field, which is, geographically speaking, it's an enormous space. And this is infrastructure, frankly, it goes back a lot of it to kind of Soviet days. So there's an entire new power distribution system. We're taking the entire field and taking it from high-pressure production to lower pressure in the WPMP process and then building the really large sour gas injection and incremental production facilities. And it's \u2013 so it's almost a field-wide refurbishment of a lot of it and then this big increment of production. And the commissioning of that is incredibly complex. And as we went in and did this cost and schedule review early in \u2013 relatively early in the commissioning process, based on what we were seeing, what became evident is that we need to account for that complexity in our schedule. And I don't think it was fully reflected in the schedule. And in a big, complex project like this, you find things. And early on, we found challenges in the utility system. And it cost us some time. And it \u2013 that ripples through. And so the guidance we're giving you now is really what I would say is it's more conservative because it assumes that those kinds of things are going to be encountered for the balance of the project. And we need to set expectations that those are the realities that we're going to be dealing with. And so that's why the schedule lights all in commissioning. It's \u2013 bulk construction is completed. All the equipment is there. And this really is the final commissioning process. If we do well, we could end up on the front end of those windows that I gave you. But we've given you those because our experience says we should not plan for that, we had to plan for the reality of these things. And as I mentioned in response to the earlier question by Neil, we've added incremental resources in multiple areas now, ought to be \u2013 to anticipate and be prepared for these kinds of challenges. And so I think the lesson is on the projects like this, of which there are a few, in the future, our commissioning plans will reflect that complexity more completely than the commissioning plans did on this one. Pierre Breber : And I'll just add some comments on affiliate dividends. So we've given a guide on fourth quarter affiliate dividends, which falls short of the full-year guide that we did at the start of the year. That shortfall is not from TCO, that's from CPChem, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, on lower petchem margins. It's also from Angola LNG on lower TTF prices than we had assumed. We've also had some of the Angola LNG cash has come back to us as return to capital. In terms of TCO, we had a $600 million dividend Chevron share in the second quarter. We can't get ahead of the TCO Board on the fourth quarter. But 90% or so of the fourth quarter guide is related TCO. I'll remind you last year that TCO dividend was $1.6 billion Chevron share. All these numbers are before the withholding tax. So we'll see a pretty significant increase in the total year TCO dividend. Now some of that was the \u2013 getting some of the excess cash off the balance sheet like we were talking about. But if you go back to the period prior to the start of this construction, so the period into 2015, we're seeing dividends now \u2013 or this year's dividend will be similar to what we saw from that time period. So the inflection is happening after five years of either not receiving dividends or, in fact, putting cash out, essentially having negative free cash flow. So we know production is going to be down next year. We showed that. So you'd expect dividends to reflect that a little bit. We have a little bit of increase in CapEx. And then we'll be heading to this more than $4 billion in 2025. And all of that is \u2013 that guidance is at $60. So we're seeing some positive news in terms of the cash flow coming out. Clearly disappointing news on the revised schedule, but we're going to work hard to deliver it in the front end of the range. Thanks, Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for my question. So I have a follow-up on the Permian ex PDC. You were down 2% in 3Q, including the non-op piece, and really helpful color there from Mike on Biraj's question. But just \u2013 it does leave a pretty big jump to hit guidance in 4Q, around 10%, if I calculate it right. So are you sticking with that 770,000 guide for the legacy piece? And if not, is there a good way to think about 4Q production in general? Michael Wirth : Yes, John, we're not changing the guidance. Overall on production, excluding PDC, we expect to be the lower end of overall guidance. Permian production is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Full year production expected around 770,000, 780,000 or so if you include PDC. And so yes, the guidance is still intact for the Permian. Go ahead, Pierre. Pierre Breber : Yes. Mike talked about the 2% shortfall on non-op, which averages to about 0.5%. He talked about also some of these surface constraints. So we have worked to overcome the shortfall we saw in non-op in the third quarter to deliver that. So no change in guidance. But clearly, we have a little more work to do in the fourth quarter to achieve it. We do expect though fourth quarter, more POPs and more production, in line with the plan that we laid out earlier this year. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Mike, I know you've been traveling around, so thank you for making the time for us this morning. I want to try and defend you a little bit here this morning. Because if you look at the remaining life of Tengiz, about half of that value has been taken out of your stock this morning. I can't imagine you're happy about announcing another series of challenges. So my question is this, at a philosophical level, how would you characterize what you and your management team and the organization are doing to avoid these kind of issues on major projects going forward? You've got a lot of things in the queue through 2027. Why should the market be comfortable that you can execute on that timeline with what you have in your portfolio? Michael Wirth : Well, Doug, you're right. I think there has been a reaction apparently in the market this morning to this. We've spent a lot of time \u2013 I'll go back to Jay Johnson spending time not only in these calls but on traveling around, talking about what we're doing on capital project execution. This is a unique project. And I won't repeat the things that I went through earlier with Paul. But this is a large, multiyear effort that had supply chains coming in from all the way around the world through the Russian inland waterway system through the pandemic. And we've had our challenges with it. There are not projects in our queue that are remotely similar to this one. The kinds of things that we're talking about now are factory development projects across multiple shale basins. They're deepwater developments that I think the track record on those is quite different. And so I think the lessons on these really complex capital projects are that despite employing the best engineering and construction firms in the world, bringing in partners that have strong capability, they are really complex and challenging. And part of the way we mitigate that is we'd be very selective about the ones we do. We walked away from the Kitimat LNG project because we \u2013 despite a lot of efforts to make that project better, we had concerns about execution in that kind of an environment and ultimately said we're not going to take on a project like that, particularly at this point in time. And so part of it is the way you choose what you do. Part of it is continuing to learn and apply those learnings, many of which from a decade ago have been implemented into the TCO project. But some of which from the TCO project will be implemented and integrated into other projects that go forward of similar complexity. So look, we're close to the finish line on this thing. And we've got a full-court press on it to make sure that the commissioning is safe and reliable and we have a clean start-up. And the lessons from that will be applied in every other project that we do. Pierre Breber : And I'll just restate the impact that Mike \u2013 yes, thanks, Doug. And I'll just restate the impact that Mike talked about. It's $2.5 billion, that's at $60, that's less than $1.50 a share. So clearly, they were down a lot more than that. We talked about the earnings in this. We know that weighs also on the shares, at the same time, non-cash items, timing effects that reverse and discrete items that are nonrecurring. So we feel good about the company's performance in the quarter in terms of how we operated safely and reliably, how we captured margin. We know, as Mike said earlier, we have these quarters where it can be messy, can be noisy. It's one of them. But the underlying company is very strong and healthy. Douglas Leggate : I agree. It looks overdone, Pierre. Thanks so much. Pierre Breber : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Irene Himona with Societe Generale. Irene Himona : Thank you very much. Good morning. You're referring to your comments to higher OpEx and DD&A from the PDC legacy assets having impacted Q3 upstream. Now that you own that business fully and you can sort of look under the bonnet, how are you thinking about your original synergy estimates on PDC OpEx and CapEx? And how long would you expect it takes for those to start accruing to you in the results? Thank you. Michael Wirth : Yes, Irene. So I think that the reference was simply these are additive to \u2013 versus prior periods. And so I wouldn't want anybody to interpret that somehow they were different than what we expected because the OpEx and the DD&A are not different than what we expected. Synergy capture is good. We're right on track to capture all of the synergies. No change to the guidance. We're confident that there's upside. And we'll realize that over time as we have on other transactions. We think there's additional operational midstream and procurement synergies that we didn't build into our initial target. And the CapEx synergy has been captured as well. So the nice thing about this in a quarter, where I appreciate Doug's view that maybe the reaction here has been a little over, we closed the transaction five months ahead of guidance. We pick up additional production for a bigger part of the year, the earnings and cash flow that go along with that. We've already paid off some high-cost debt. And so we're integrating that into our business now. And it's a very sound transaction that is going to deliver, I think, everything that we expected and then some. Irene Himona : Thank you very much. Michael Wirth : Thanks, Irene. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hi. Hello. Michael Wirth : Good morning, Jason. Yes, we are here. Jason Gabelman : Hi. Sorry, about that. Good morning. Michael Wirth : Sorry to wake you up, Jason. Jason Gabelman : Yes. Hi. Can you hear me? Michael Wirth : I can. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Good. I wanted to ask about what's going on in your Middle East footprint. You've obviously had to take Tamar offline. I believe that's a fixed price asset that you're receiving, so probably not a large cash impact. But if you could remind us what the cash impact is and the ability to maybe reroute that gas somewhere else or offset those losses, and then how you think about the Eastern Mediterranean growth profile overall, if there's any change how you're thinking about it in light of the recent events over there. Thanks. Michael Wirth : Yes, I'll take the second part of that and then ask Pierre to address the cash and production impact. It doesn't change our view on the development opportunities really at all, Jason. This is a long-term play. It's a very, very large gas resource. We like some of the follow-on exploration opportunities in the region. We're working on the Aphrodite field in the waters offshore Cyprus to develop. We're working expansion projects that have been sanctioned on both Tamar and Leviathan and further expansion ideas on Leviathan. And so we've got to take a long-term view, which is measured in years and decades. And when you have things in the short-term that create the circumstances that we see right now, we have to be prepared to mitigate those risks and to keep people safe and maintain the integrity of our operations. But it doesn't change our long-term view on the attractiveness of the asset and the development opportunities. I'll let Pierre address the cash question. Pierre Breber : Yes. We don't talk about our specific contracts, and there's numbers of them. But I think, in effect, you're right, there's some escalators tied to inflation. There's some oil price sensitivity. But it's within sort of a floor and a ceiling. And these are regional gas prices that are well below international prices. So we don't know how long. We gave the guide on the production and the impact on cash flow is very modest. It's tens of millions of dollars in terms of doing the calculation. And so we'll just see where we end up in the quarter and how long it is shut in for. Thanks, Jason. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe switch gears a little bit to the Gulf of Mexico. Can you maybe just provide any update on an overall basis? Do you anticipate the addition of the Hess assets in the Gulf to have any impact on your approach to the basin in the coming years? And then you're scheduled to have three separate projects hitting at Anchor, St. Malo and Whale come onstream during 2024. Could you maybe update us on the progress of those projects and maybe the timing whether we should expect those in the first half or the second half of the year? Michael Wirth : Sure. So on the combination with Hess, I think we'll come back to you as we close the transaction and we integrate those. We're partners in a couple of projects that they operate. We both have lease positions out there. I think you would expect us to high-grade the exploration program as we look across a larger combined lease position and \u2013 but we'll talk to you more about that as we go forward. In terms of specific projects, yes, you're right, we've \u2013 Mad Dog 2 actually saw first oil this year. And we expect peak next year on Mad Dog 2. You can refer to the operator for more on that. Anchor and Whale are both expected for first oil next year. Anchor is seven wells in total, two that will be online in 2024, three in 2025 \u2013 no, two in 2025, two in 2026 and one then in 2027. The FPU is safely moored out there in the field right now. The manifold and pump systems and subsea manifolds are all fabricated. We've landed and tested the 20,000 psi blowout preventer. So that project is moving along nicely. Production in 2024 is modest because there's only a couple of wells online. Think of it midyear in terms of general timing. I'd refer you to Shell on the Whale project, first oil probably the latter part of 2024 and a similar kind of a profile, where you've got a smaller number of wells online initially. And then over the subsequent couple of years, you're going to see additional wells come online. And so the production impact of that starts to show up in 2025 and 2026 in a greater way than it does in 2024. And then Ballymore is actually first oil in 2025, not 2024. But that will come online in 2025, simpler development, tiebacks to Blind Faith, three wells, two of which would be online in 2025. The third one would come online in 2026. And so again, the production on that, a little bit in 2025 and then you'll see more of it in 2026 and 2027. Pierre Breber : Ryan, just more broadly on Hess, we are not planning to hold our Investor Day at our usual timing. We'll likely either have just closed or will be in the antitrust review process. This is a big transaction impacting Gulf of Mexico but transforms the portfolio overall. We gave some guidance on potential asset sales also. So you should expect us to do an Investor Day several months after we close and when we have time to really put together a combined business plan for our investors. Ryan Todd : Thank you. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Ryan. Michael Wirth : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning. You've spent part of the week engaging with your shareholder base and making the case for the acquisition of Hess. Can you talk to, not details, obviously, but perhaps the tone of those conversations, the enthusiasm, anything that surprised you? Michael Wirth : I'd say overall \u2013 and of course, we met with \u2013 I was out. Pierre was in some separate meetings than I was. But I was out in a number of meetings with John Hess, sometimes the larger Hess shareholders, sometimes with larger Chevron shareholders. I would say, in general, people see the long-term value proposition very clearly here. And I think they see it as a combined company that is stronger and one that is set up to be stronger for longer with the ability to really sustain cash distributions to shareholders in a very consistent, predictable and durable fashion long into the future. And so that is \u2013 there's no doubt about that. Some of the questions, on the one side, did you get a high enough price? On the other side, did you pay too much, right? So there was tension in the \u2013 in that, to be honest, during the negotiation. It was \u2013 as we mentioned, this has been going on for some time. And John and I have been looking for a way to do a deal that is actually one that's good for both sets of shareholders and not easy because it's a great asset and the market recognizes that value. And so I think you can find nuances from people who either held one of the stocks or the other for certain reasons. And maybe this wasn't exactly what they expected. But broadly speaking, I would say people see the long-term value creation. They see the transparency to resource depth, to production growth. The fact that you now have \u2013 with Hess, you've got a much more diversified set of assets attached to their portfolio, which derisks any one of those assets. And it brings forward cash distributions to their shareholders meaningfully that would have still been several years into the future. For the Chevron shareholders, who were wondering what comes next after what they can currently see over the next several years in our portfolio, rather than us pointing to a range of potential answers to that and say, \"We'll do the best of these,\" and we've got plenty of organic investment opportunities we're working on, I think it gives some confidence and certainty of what underpins that for the future. And so broadly speaking, those are the kinds of discussions that we've had. Bob Brackett : Very quick. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. My question, Mike, is more on your shareholder return. You continue to have great financials and the shareholder return, both on the dividend and the buyback side, continues to be quite high, paying out a bit over 100% of your free cash flow. I'm just wondering, as you continue to have the growth opportunities ahead you do, do you see any change in that shareholder return, particularly on the share buyback or you continue to try to balance kind of the growth and buyback programs you have now? Michael Wirth : Yes. We've had a very consistent set of financial priorities for many, many years. The first of which is to sustain and grow the dividend, 36 consecutive years now of per share dividend payouts for the last five years has been a 6% CAGR. Actually, I think the last 15 years have been a 6% CAGR and an announcement of 8% early next year, subject to Board approval. I think there's a strong track record there you can expect to continue. Second is to be disciplined in organic reinvestment into the business to grow those cash flows. You can be confident that we will continue to be disciplined in that reinvestment to drive returns and value. Number three is a strong balance sheet. Pierre mentioned we're single-digit net debt ratio today. That's lower than we have guided to over time. And so over time, you can expect the balance sheet to move back towards the 20% to 25% gearing range that we've identified as where we're comfortable through the cycle. And then the fourth are the share repurchases. And we've got a range now of $10 billion to $20 billion. We're at the high end of that range when we close the transaction with Hess with $17.5 billion annually. Today, that's 5% to 6% of our float each and every year. And we've \u2013 I won't go through the details, but we've indicated we can sustain that in a lower price environment. And that's where the lower end of that range would apply. And certainly in a higher price environment, which is where we find ourselves today, we're at the high end of that range. And so we would expect to be consistent, predictable and to sustain that. I mean, consistent and durable being the keywords here. So I think the broad framework is likely to remain unchanged. And I think our behavior will be very consistent with what you've come to see from us historically. Neal Dingmann : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Michael Wirth : Thank you, Neal. Operator : We'll take our final question from Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Thanks. Hi, Mike, Pierre and Jake. Can I go back to Hess? For several years, Chevron has looked a bit different to the other integrated oil companies in terms of the low downstream exposure. And of course, now you're re-weighting even further to the upstream. So does that balance bother you at all? Or maybe how do you think about what an integrated oil company is? Michael Wirth : Yes, Alastair, the short answer is no, it doesn't bother me. We actually have been becoming a more downstream-weighted company the last several years. And that may not be obvious to most people, but we've been \u2013 our CapEx into the upstream has been below our depreciation. So our upstream business has been declining as a percentage of capital employed. In the downstream, we've made some big investments. We acquired a refinery in Texas. We acquired a renewable energy company. We've invested in new petrochemical facilities. We've got two more of those petrochemical expansion projects underway right now. And so we had gone from 80-20 weighting or 85-15 weighting upstream to downstream and chemicals to 80-20 over the last few years. When we close this transaction, we'll be back at 80-20, which is \u2013 or 85-15, I'm sorry, which is where we've historically been. And that reflects a fundamental view that we believe that over the cycle, returns in the upstream are likely to be structurally higher than in the downstream primarily because refineries are hard to close. They get built for reasons other than just pure economics. And governments tend to intervene in transportation fuels markets, in particular, when prices are high, which kind of takes you out of full cycle economics. And they kind of clip \u2013 tend to put the peaks off of those, whereas in the upstream, you've got a declining resource base and you've got growing demand. And so the fundamentals rebalance more quickly. You remove a little bit of investment. And you see decline takeover and you see demand continue to grow. And so markets get imbalanced and the upstream rebalance more quickly. We also have been more oil-weighted than some of our peers. And fundamentally, that reflects a view that there are more alternatives to substitute for gas, particularly in power generation than there are for liquids in transportation. And so those are kind of high-level drivers of why our portfolio has been constructed the way that it is. We want to be an integrated company. We think there are real opportunities to capture economic value through integration to build the capabilities to run our entire business by bringing capabilities, technology, skills to bear across those different segments. But our peers are all weighted more to the up than the downstream. The ratios are a little bit different. And we've long held those views and constructed a portfolio that reflects them. Thanks for your question. Alastair Syme : Thank you, Mike. Michael Wirth : You bet. Jake Spiering : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide two. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Jake, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Chevron delivered another year of solid results in 2023. During a time of geopolitical turmoil and economic uncertainty, our objective remained unchanged; safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. Our clear and consistent approach resulted in an adjusted ROCE of 14% and enabled a record of $26 billion in cash return to shareholders, while growing production to accompany a record. We also successfully integrated PDC Energy and announced the Hess acquisition. We're now focused on the FTC's second request and expect to file the draft S4 later this quarter with closing anticipated around the middle of the year and we continue to take action in lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and growing lower carbon businesses, advancing foundational projects in both hydrogen and carbon capture. Over the past five-year commodity cycle, with prices high, low and everywhere in between, Chevron led the peer group in what we believe are the most important measures that create value. We were the most capital efficient while managing unit costs well below inflation and many peers. Capital and cost discipline always matter in a commodity business. Combining this discipline with our focused portfolio of advantage assets, Chevron was able to lead the peer group in returning cash to shareholders. Our five-year dividend growth rate was greater than the S&P 500 and more than double our nearest peer. Surplus cash was returned to our shareholders in each of the past five years through share buybacks. Our track record has proven and we intend to continue growing value for our shareholders in any environment. In the Permian, we delivered on our full-year production guidance. Instead, a quarterly record of 867,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while building our DUC inventory in the fourth quarter. Looking to the year ahead, our program is back-end loaded as we plan to continue to build our DUC inventory before adding an additional completion crew in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect production in the first half of the year to be down from the fourth quarter by about 2% to 4% before climbing toward a 2024 exit rate around 900,000 barrels per day. Chevron is a clear leader in Permian financial returns in the Permian with our unique royalty advantage and strong execution across a diverse portfolio. We have strong momentum and expect to achieve one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. At TCO, we\u2019re making progress towards the first phase of WPMP FGP start-up. The slide shows how the project fits within the overall field and facilities. The field, currently flowing at high pressure, continues to keep the existing plants full. In fact 2023 net production was the highest since 2020. We\u2019ve completed a lot of project scope that is already operational. TCO is producing from the new wells. The upgraded and new utilities, gathering system, control center and power distribution system are all currently in operation. For WPMP, we\u2019re focused on starting up major equipment \u2013 including gas turbine generators, pumps and compressors. We expect to hand over to operations the first pressure boost compressor in March for final dynamic commissioning. Once we have PBF compression online, WPMP start-up is expected to begin in the second quarter when the first metering station is converted to low pressure, which will enable increased flow rates. Low pressure production streams going back to existing process units will be driven by the pressure boost compression. At the same time, production from metering stations not yet converted will continue to flow in the high-pressure system. We expect metering station conversions through the remainder of the year as additional pressure boost compressors start up, keeping the existing plants full around planned KTL and SGI turnarounds For FGP, we\u2019re focused on starting up additional gas turbine generators and compressors along with multiple processing units. The sour gas injection facilities have already been handed over to operations for final commissioning. FGP start-up is expected in the first half of next year when incremental production enabled by field conversion to low pressure will be processed in the new 3GP facility. Since last quarter, two boilers came online and two gas turbine generators have delivered power. We\u2019ve seen improvement in work scope delivery and have been working through additional discovery items. We\u2019ll continue to update you on progress and remain focused on key milestones to deliver a safe and reliable start-up. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials. Pierre Breber : Thanks Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2.3 billion, or $1.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion, or $3.45 per share. Included in the quarter were $3.7 billion in charges pre-announced in January. Foreign currency charges were almost $480 million. Our 2023 CapEx included $650 million of inorganic acquisitions and around $450 million invested in legacy PDC assets post-closing. Excluding these items, CapEx was about 5% above budget after three consecutive years below. Share repurchases matched the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the year with a net debt ratio comfortably in the single digits. Turning to the quarter, adjusted earnings were higher than last quarter by roughly $730 million. Adjusted upstream earnings improved due to higher liftings, in line with record quarterly production, and favorable timing effects. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased on lower refining margins, partially offset by a favorable swing in timing effects. All Other benefited from lower corporate taxes and employee costs. For the full year, adjusted earnings decreased nearly $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower prices. Adjusted Downstream earnings were lower largely due to declining refining margins. Other segment earnings improved on lower employee costs and higher interest income. Solid financial performance enabled Chevron to deliver, again, on all four of its financial priorities. We announced an 8% increase in our dividend, reflecting our confidence in expected future free cash flow growth. We maintained capital discipline in both traditional and new energies. We reduced debt by over $4 billion, including all debt assumed in the PDC acquisition and we repurchased about 5% of our shares outstanding. Last year, we produced more oil and gas than any other year in the company\u2019s history, including a record number of LNG cargoes out of Australia. We expect 2024 production to be higher again, by 4% to 7%. Our plans include production growth in the DJ Basin, with a full year of legacy PDC operations and continued organic growth in the Permian. Our guidance this year includes an estimated impact from asset sales as we further high-grade our portfolio. Looking ahead, our first quarter downtime estimate includes around 20 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day associated with January\u2019s cold weather in North America. Earnings estimates from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by Pascagoula. Share repurchases in the quarter will continue to be restricted under SEC regulations. Depending on commodity prices and margins, affiliate dividends are estimated around $4 billion, roughly flat with last year. We do not expect significant affiliate dividends in the first quarter. The difference between affiliate earnings and dividends is expected to decrease in the second half of the year after TCO\u2019s start-up of WPMP. Our CapEx guidance range is unchanged from the December budget announcement. In prior years, our CapEx rate in the first half of the year was about 20% lower than the second half. Our price sensitivities have increased at higher production levels. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG sales and less than 10% relates to North America natural gas liquids. Back to you, Mike. Mike Wirth : In closing, our priorities are clear : Safely execute with excellence, maintain capital and cost discipline; and return cash to shareholders. We\u2019re excited about the pending Hess acquisition which will further strengthen Chevron. I also want to personally thank Pierre for his invaluable contributions over his 35-year career with the company. He\u2019s been an exceptional strategic partner to me and an outstanding leader, helping guide Chevron to create significant value for shareholders. I wish him all the best in his retirement. I\u2019ll now hand it off to Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the line. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question and firstly, Pierre, congrats on a great career and all the best for retirement and thanks for all the help over recent years. I feel compelled to ask you a question on buybacks because it's your last time, but I'll try and resist. So the question's on the Permian. You had a very strong production number in Q4, quite an inflection from what we've seen in the last few quarters and I was interested in particular the comment on that volume growth alongside building the DUC inventory. So presumably the non-op side was a nice contribution in Q4. Could you just give some clarity on the bridge sort of 3Q to 4Q because the market has been concerned about you hitting the number of the lease for this year most recently. Thank you. Pierre Breber : Sure. So, in the third quarter, non-op was a little light, but in the fourth quarter, it came back. It didn't end the year. Non-op and royalty are right where we guided to from the beginning of the year. So, through a year, the quarterly ups and downs on some of these things, can create some questions, but it came in right as we guided to it in the mid-teens. The story on the fourth quarter was really strong execution. We had more POPs because we had faster drilling and faster cycle time on completions. We had a shorter cycle time from frack to POP. So all of those increased and as you noted, we did continue to build our DUC inventory because drilling performance was so strong. A couple other things, POPs in the fourth quarter were weighted towards New Mexico. We had guided towards activity that would lead to more POPs in New Mexico in the second half of the year. Those wells are more productive than kind of on average than the rest of the portfolio. So that flows through. And then the final thing that I would point to is we had higher reliability. You'll recall in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about some midstream constraints and other things that weren't related to completions or POPs or anything else, but they were constraints on flow. We had fewer frack hits. We had fewer scheduled delays, weather downtime, and midstream issues in the quarter. So all of that contributed to the strong performance there in the fourth quarter and we ended the year right on our guidance. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yeah, thank you so much, Pierre. You're going out in style, and thanks for all the great insights and wisdom over the years. Pierre Breber : Thanks, Neil. My question's on Slide six, the TCO update. It sounds like the schedule and the cost guidance that was provided in November is still on track, but for us non-engineers, maybe, Mike, you can kind of walk us through the schematic and help us understand what of these boxes are the critical path issues that we should be focused on. Mike Wirth : Yeah. So, you're right, Neil. The schedule and cost guidance is unchanged. I apologize for a more complex slide than we usually put out in front of you, but we want to be as transparent as we can and help people understand what's going on there at the field. Last quarter, we talked about our action plan, and we're seeing improved productivity. We've shifted scope amongst contractors. We've added more engineering support in the field and as we move through this, we're encountering discovery work, as we expected. We found some around piping stress and alignment that we're working on right now. The key thing to think about here is, first of all, there's a lot of stuff that's up and running. All the new wells are producing right now, all this infrastructure, in terms of utility and power distribution and control center, is up and running and as we -- and so that's keeping the plants full and we saw really strong performance last year. I mentioned the strongest in four years and the fourth strongest in the history of the field. So, we're seeing good deliverability out of the new wells, which is the key thing for production this year, is keeping those plants full while we begin to convert the field from pushing into a high-pressure plant to lower back pressure on the field, which improves deliverability from the wells and allows us to extend the life of the field and get up to a million barrels a day. So when we begin converting these metering stations and there are 21 of them, we will then take production from a metering station now that is producing under low pressure and we'll boost that back up to get into the existing plant. As we get more and more of those converted, more of these pressure boost compressors online, we'll get the whole field now producing against the lower back pressure, which gives us a lot of excess well capacity and it ensures that we are going to keep the plant full and as we then bring on the new process equipment, we start to route that low-pressure production into a plant that will run at lower pressure. And so that's really the kind of the high-level description of what we're trying to convey there and we've got a legend that shows you certain things are going to begin start up in various quarters. For FGP, we're focused on commissioning the major equipment there that will allow us to bring up the plant that will take us to a million barrels a day and we're transferring learnings from compressors, pumps, and other things that we're working on now, walking down all the critical substations and we'll continue to provide updates on the key milestones here. We're talking about a couple of gas turbine generators online. First quarter is the Inlet separator is ready for operation and we'll commission that on sweet fluids as we prepare it for sour production and then, as I said, in the second quarter, we begin the PBF startup and metering station conversions. So it's all on track with our guidance and we will continue to provide you detail as we move forward each quarter on specific milestones and progress. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, Pierre. I have to offer my congrats as well and with the quarter today, thanks for making us in the sales side look smart. It's a nice way to go out. So best wishes in retirement. Pierre Breber : Thank you, Doug. Doug Leggate : My question, Mike, is I guess it's got a part A and B, so apologies to Jake on that, but it's kind of around disposals. Our understanding from the Hess side is that despite the fact that you haven't filed the S4 yet, you haven't got the FTC yet, and I realize those processes are ongoing, but the integration planning is still going ahead full steam and I'm just curious if you can offer any color on how that process has evolved as it relates specifically to portfolio high grading. The absence of Malaysia in your go-forward plan, for example, it seems to me the $15 billion number might have a lot of upside. So any color you can offer on that topic, please. Mike Wirth : Yeah. Doug, it's really premature for us to comment on that until the transaction closes. Hess has a pretty tight portfolio of assets that are performing well and we really need to close the deal, have access to all the data and re-optimize all of our views of portfolio investments and update our new plan and so I don't want to speculate on any assets and look, we've got some of our own assets that we do have out in the public domain already. You may have seen reports on Kaybob Duvernay on Congo. So, there are some divestments that we have signalled out of the Chevron portfolio and I think as you see the divestments unfold over the next few years because we will have more assets in the portfolio that come from Legacy Chevron that is likely to be a greater contributor I would guess to the overall $10 billion to $15 billion number than things that come in through this transaction, but I can't comment on Malaysia or any other particular asset until we get past the close. Doug Leggate : A lot of options. Thanks so much. Thanks for the answer. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Going back to the Permian you're stepping up the CapEx this year to about $5 billion versus $4 billion last year to help you deliver the year-over-year growth. As you continue to ramp towards the million BOE per day target, what's needed from a CapEx standpoint to deliver this growth? Can you stay closer to the $5 billion range or does that step up towards $6 billion in 2025 because you have an accelerating pace to hit that? Thanks. Pierre Breber : Yeah no. Appreciate the question Josh. We're starting this year with 12 rigs and three frack crews. I mentioned we'll add a fourth frac crew around the middle of the year, but at the same time, we're becoming more efficient. We need fewer rigs to drill the planned lateral feet that we've got out in front of us and so as we as we close in on a million barrels a day, we're at the capital level that I think is going to be required to get us there and then the really nice thing about this is when you're trying to hold the plateau as opposed to grow from seven to eight to nine hundred 700, 800 to 900 to a million a day, you actually can pull capital spending down because you're offsetting decline. You're not trying to offset decline and grow by significant chunks each year and so inflation has moderated and that has been a challenge. We've talked about some of the things we're moving water around a little bit more, but that's embedded in our plan now going forward. So I would not anticipate that we're going to have to go towards $6 billion in order to get there and you know as we as we get to each year, we'll give you an updated guide on it, but when we plateau production capital spending and capital discipline really matters. I just want to emphasize this. We intend to live within our capital means and be really tight on capital and that applies to the Permian along with every other asset. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you and first I want to congratulate Pierre and thank you for all the years that actually all over the past couple of decades that all the help. We may appreciate. Pierre Breber : Thanks Paul. Paul Cheng : Michael and Pierre, I think Michael when you when you first become the CEO, I think one focus is that course method for you and that full for the last several years, there's a lot of acquisition and change in portfolio. So it's very difficult for us from the outside to see where's your cost structure compared to let's say before the pandemic in 2019? Is there any way that you can help us in terms of what is the structural cost base that for you today compared to say a number of years ago, especially during the early part of the pandemic. You guys did have a restructuring effort. Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yeah Paul, I don't have all that stuff right on the top of my head to go back to 2019. It's a fair request, but look I think we showed a chart in here over the last several years that our unit costs are relatively flat in fact. I think we're number two on that chart. We don't break out each of the competitors. Our unit OpEx last year was about $15.80 a barrel which is about 5% lower than the year before and we still have outstanding unit optics reduction targets going out to 2026 at mid-cycle. We've had some inflation along the way, but you're right. We took a lot of costs out of the business in 2020 and 2021. So, as we bring together, Hess, and this gets a little bit to the question that Doug was asking as well, we will come out with, an update to investors that talks about the portfolio updates, guidance on all the metrics that matter and I assure you that I have not changed my view that cost control, excuse me, cost control always matters, and capital discipline always matters. So, we will update you on those numbers specifically, Paul. Operator : We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for everything, Pierre. Maybe this one will be an easy or a hard one for you, depending on what you were planning for, but it's about, it's a follow-up on TCO in Kazakhstan and the affiliate dividend guidance and what's interesting about it is that it's flat year-over-year with a commodity assumption that maybe a little bit lower than the prior year and within affiliates, there's also some LNG exposure, which isn't as strong as it was last year, ex-TCO and so, I guess the question is like, you've given this really robust technical update on Tengiz and where we stand, but are we already at a point where TCO is sustaining a level of dividends that's a little bit more stable than it was kind of at the peak of the construction process or the installation process and we're sort of in a progression to this pro-forma, very stable cash flow profile from TCO, or is that number, am I reading too much into that affiliate guidance number? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Sam. Absolutely, TCO dividends are on a higher trajectory just because capital is wound down and as we've said, when we get the incremental production from FGP, it goes even higher. There are some puts and takes. So we talked in last year that TCO had held some surplus cash and released that last year. This year, they're going to have to build some cash as they head into debt payments, which as you recall, we co-lent. So we'll be receiving that. So there are some -- there'll be some timing variation, but your point around the trajectory is absolutely right because CapEx is winding down. So this has been largely self-funded as an affiliate company. As CapEx goes down, there's more cash available. It does depend on commodity price assumptions. You're right, LNG is in there and also petchem. And so those are the major drivers, a little bit of refining are the major drivers of our affiliate dividend. So it's a roughly flat with the prior year. We'll update that as we go along during the year, but absolutely, TCO, we've been investing in that project for eight years. It's going to generate a lot of cash when it comes on next year. Pierre Breber : Thank you so much and maybe, Sam, just one more point and what you're going to see too is because it's tricky as an affiliate that that line that's affiliate earnings less dividend, that's going to flip, and until you'll see it, it'll be hard for everyone to model it, but what has been historically a line where affiliate earnings are higher than dividends, you will see that flip in time as we pull out more cash out of TCO in particular than the earnings than the book earnings are. Operator : We'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Nitin Kumar : Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. So it's a party in Part A and Part B type of question, but really on the Permian, Mike, in your slides, you highlight that optimize well spacing and maybe coring up where you were drilling in 2023 help the well productivity. At the Analyst Day, you had talked about some technologies and I'm just curious where any of the improvements you saw in '23 related to those and then Part B very quickly, you're growing almost 200,000 barrels from here until in the next two years. Last core, you had some infrastructure issues. What are you doing to get ahead of those infrastructure issues that don't resurface over that plan period? Mike Wirth : Yeah Nitin, what I would say on technology, I reference the fact that we're drilling more feet out of the same rig fleet, we're improving on completions and so there are a lot of small things that are contributing to the performance that we're seeing right now. The improved recovery technologies are in various stages of being piloted out in the field and so to the extent some of those pilots are in the production, they contribute, but I would say it's at the margin, because we're gathering field data to look at changes in completion and fracture techniques using gas injection and gas lift in different ways using some different chemicals to improve flow. So as we get those into large scale deployment, we'll start to talk about that and we'll help you understand how they're contributing, but I would say right now it's more on the drilling and completions cycle time side that we're seeing some of these improvements and so there's more to come. On midstream infrastructure, some of the issues that we've talked about before can be -- they can be weather related, they can be related to some regulatory items, they can be related to a particular gas processing plant or gathering or off-take pipeline system. We're working all of those because your point is well made as a large producing asset at that scale. We need really, really reliable performance downstream of the wells and we have no constraints on takeaway capacity out of the basin. So we're well positioned, not just for '24 but into '25 and '26 with ultimate takeaway capacity to access the market, but we do have a lot of pipes, pumps, tanks and other things between the field and the market and those things need to perform and that is a high priority for our operations team in the field. As I mentioned, fourth quarter performance was very strong and they're on this and it's a very high priority. We saw a little bit of weather in January, which Pierre guided to that will have a modest impact, but we're confident that we've got a line of sight on all the operational priorities in order to ensure that that market access isn't constrained. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, thanks for taking my question and Pierre, I want to echo the congrats. Thanks for all the help over the years. I wanted to circle back to TCO and Mike, I think last quarter when you provided the updated guidance on timeline, one of the things that you noted was workforce productivity and I was wondering if you comment on some of the changes that you've implemented to improve labor productivity over the past several months, how it's progressing first plan and in your comments, you mentioned improved scope of work in the context of FGP. I'm not sure that's related to labor or something else, but if you could elaborate on that comment as well, that'd be great. Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yeah. So, we have multiple contractors working on commissioning and startup and so this is everything from walking systems down to ensure that that they've been properly inspected that we refer to as punch list items have been identified, which is work that still needs to be completed by contractors and then you get into the loop checks and equipment runs and all the work to bring pieces of equipment up into service. So we've got a number of contractors working on this. We've moved scope from contractors that have had lower productivity to those that have exhibited a higher productivity. We've brought in additional resources to beef up the overall capacity and the resources are the contractors that had lower productivity, we've worked with them to understand where are the constraints in the bottlenecks and we've seen one who had a productivity factor as we measure it that was down in the kind of 0.4 range previously is up above 0.7 now and we're targeting to get that up again by a similar quantum. So there's a lot of work on the ground to be sure we've got the right people working on the right things that we have enough contract resources. We're also bringing in technical resources as we discover items that need more technical solutions and that can include company people or vendor people and we're out much further ahead. Last quarter or the quarter before the walk downs and other identification of issues was a few short weeks ahead of the crews that were actually doing this work. We're several weeks now, seven, eight or more weeks out ahead of the teams that are doing the work. So you've got much better ability to plan and execute the work in a much more efficient manner because you've got some time to put the work backs together, get the permitting done, be sure that you've got all the right tools, equipment, etcetera. So it's a great big project, Devin. It's the largest brownfield project and most complex brownfield project I've seen in my life and we're seeing good improvements in terms of the on the ground performance out of our team and out of all the contractor teams that are working on this. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yeah, hey, I just want to echo everyone's comments. Pierre, been great working with you and good luck in retirement. Pierre Breber : Thank you, Jason. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to ask, go back to the Permian Basin and I appreciate the type curve data that you provided in the back of the slide deck. It's a bit difficult to reconcile with the data with the type curves you provided, particularly for the Delaware at the 2023 Capital Markets Day when you forecasted a large improvement in productivity. Can you just talk about if your type curves, particularly in the Delaware basin, ended up in line with where you anticipated them being as shown in that Capital Markets Day type curve? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So I'll quickly just touch on the Midland Basin where we continue to be a first quartile performer, steady consistent performance. We understand the geology. There's less fluid complexity and so we're a top quartile, first quartile performer there in the Midland. In the Delaware, we last year showed actual data on a Delaware-wide basis and then we showed some forward guidance, particularly focused on New Mexico because we were shifting so much of our program into New Mexico, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a more productive portion of the basin and in the Delaware, New Mexico, we saw significant improvement with our second half POPs. Last year more than 80% of our POPs were in the second half in these more productive areas and the subsurface performance there has been very strong. In the appendix, we've got a slide that shows you 49 POPs out of the 59 POPs were in the second half and you can see that they lay right on the type curve and then you can see the improvement in the Delaware Basin, Texas, which we didn't guide to last year because it was in that combined chart there, but we've seen strong improvement. We've updated our well spacing and completion designs there and within the basin, there are sub-basins and some of those are performing exceptionally strong as well. So we're seeing performance that is very consistent with what we outlined in the markets today last year. I think the shift in basis was just to provide you a little bit more detail into these sub-basins and we'll continue to report on that basis going forward. Pierre Breber : And just as a reminder, too, Jason, so last year's performance in New Mexico wasn't impacted by long-sitting DUCs. So the year-on-year is bang-on. It's consistent with the set guidance and you see the improvement in Texas because there was the impact from long-sitting DUCs in the prior year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeffrey [ph] with TPH & Company. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up actually on the Permian and specifically ask on the program this year, what kind of opportunity do you see from here for further improvements to spacing and completion design cycle times, if any, in the Texas Delaware region? And could what's working well there translate to New Mexico to make those wells even stronger or quicker to drill and complete or even to the Midland side? And then secondly, how are you all thinking about the mix of capital allocation across these regions within the Permian throughout this year? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yeah, so, we're constantly looking to learn and improve and as I mentioned earlier, we've seen significant improvement in drilling time, completion time, time from completion to POP this year and these are a lot of little things, right? This is as you continue doing things, you find more and more efficiencies. We can bring more technology to bear, etcetera. So, and we look to extend those learnings across the basin and frankly between basins. So into the DJ basin and from the DJ basin down to the Permian, there are differences in the sub-basins that you have to understand and respect, but, the short answer is yes. We are looking for ways to transfer, learnings across there and every time I think we're probably, at the plateau in terms of productivity improvement, smart people find ways to continue to get even better at this and so, I don't think we've seen the end of the performance improvement cycle. Our overall capital allocation into the basin is largely a function of where our portfolio lies. About 25% is in the Midland Basin. 25% is in the Delaware, New Mexico portion of the basin and then the balance about 50% is in Delaware, Texas. It's been that way here, this past year and going forward, that's a pretty good way to approximate it. Operator : We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning, and thanks and congratulations to Pierre. I'm going to give you guys a break on TCO and the Permian. I'm going to ask a question on the DJ. So just looking at this growth of 125 KBD for '24, how should we think about that growth off of a pro forma '23 basin? Just trying to understand what's kind of the underlying, real growth rate in the DJ and then if you could just update us, with a couple quarters behind you now post PDC [ph] on your broader plans for development, the DJ. Mike Wirth : Yeah, so we've now got a fourth quarter is the first full quarter with PDC. The third quarter we had two months out of the three with PDC in there. And you can see we came in in the fourth quarter a little bit over 400,000 barrels a day, which is our plans are to hold the DJ around 400,000 barrels a day going forward in a highly efficient factory and fourth quarter was maybe even a little stronger than we might have expected. There wasn't as much weather related downtime in November and December and then there were some accounting adjustments that were booked into the fourth quarter that were not really related to operations. So the above 400 is there's a few things contributing to that that probably are not repeating or going to pull back a little bit. But we're confident we can hold around 400,000 barrels a day. We're still executing the well design and well spacing that was in the PDC basis of design, which is a little bit different than ours. A little few more wells and tighter spacing and driven more to drive volume. Our basis of design is more focused on return on invested capital and so it's wider spacing. It's bigger fracks, but it's less capital overall and higher return and so as we transition to a standardized, more standardized basis of design across the basin, you'll see that roll into the numbers. We got four rigs that are going. We got permits out for multiple years, nearly to the end of the decade and so we're very, very pleased and we're learning things. I got to tell you, you know, there's some stuff that we've learned from PDC that will apply not only in the rest of the DJ, but it's going to apply in the Permian as well. It's going to help us. So, going forward, these are high cash margin, low break even barrels. We plan to hold it at a plateau around 400 and we've -- synergies are on track there. We've got virtually all the CapEx synergies are essentially in the bag. We're already down to $1 billion there. OpEx is very close to the $100 million we got into. We're now seeing some procurement synergies, which we hadn't originally envisioned. So everything about it is at or better than what we had guided to. Operator : We'll go next to Lucas Herman [ph] with BNP Paribas. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, thanks very much and Pierre, I'll add my comments to the host already, but thank you for all the insights always been worth listening to. When I look at the growth that you're likely to see in oil in particular over the next two to three years, it feels as though you're going to be adding towards 0.5 million barrels, maybe slightly more barrels of pretty high margin black oil and I guess the question is about whiplash and it's the increased sensitivity that the business is going to have to movement in, of all this high-efficiency. And what, you feel Pierre, Mike, that implies the balance sheet and the way you think about balance sheet and managing things. And just if I could add on, just give me an idea of what the loan repayment schedule looks like at TCO and I presume that loan repayments, will go through the net in the net outline on the CapEx side or the investment side of the equation. Or, do they play elsewhere? Thank you. Pierre Breber : Right. No, thanks, Lucas. I'll take it. We've been overweight upstream and overweight oil liquids for a long time and you're right. Recent acquisitions and Hess certainly adds to that and we like that exposure. In terms of how we manage the balance sheet, the first thing is we start with our break even. So what it takes, the oil price it takes to cover our CapEx and dividend, that was in the low 50s last year and so we see mostly upside and that's why we had record share buybacks last year, almost $15 billion, 5% of our shares outstanding, because we're built for a price well below where we currently are. We've also done it while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our net debt ratio of 7%. We've said as we keep our share, we purchase this steady across the cycle that we're okay re-levering back up towards the low end of our guidance range, which is 20% to 25%. So that guidance that's a kind of through the cycle net debt ratio guidance, that still holds and if we had a significant change in the portfolio, of course we would look at that going forward, but I think the actions that we're taking are consistent with that guidance and again, adding that exposure when you're built at the break even, when we think about our balance sheet, you take into account lots of things, your portfolio, the commodity price outlook, but your breakeven is really key and Mike was talking about capital and cost discipline, our ability to fund our reinvestment program in both traditional and new energies and grow the company and pay a growing dividend, right? More than twice our nearest peer, greater than S&P 500. We just increased at 8%. So all those numbers are before the latest increase. We can do all that at a low price, return surplus cash. That's how we're going to think about it. So again, you'd expect our net debt to increase over time depending on commodity prices and how we return cash to shareholders. We're not having more exposure to high margin barrels, as you say. That's a good thing. We're built for it and as long as we keep our break even low and below where prices are trading, we're in a really good spot. Unidentified Analyst : And how TC loan payments flow through? Pierre Breber : Oh, yeah. So TC loan payments, sorry about that, yeah, because I alluded to that. That will not be in cash from ops. That shows up in our investing cash. So Jake and the team will take you all through that, but yeah, what I was saying about that affiliate line flipping, that's separate from this in a different line. We will see cash being returned and it's a billion our share next year, again two billion in '26, and then in '28 or '30. So all that's disclosing our 10-K. Jake can take you through that. but yeah, that's only additional and again, we shouldn't be surprised. We've been investing for eight years in this project. That cash is going to come back once the project starts up. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Pierre, thanks. And if you're in London and fancy a game of tennis, give us a buzz. That's what I'll be doing. Sounds good, Lucas. Operator : We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Irene Himona : Thank you very much and Pierre, all the best for the next chapter. My question is on Henry Hub. In the new sensitivities you published today, you saw a very material 30% increase in your Henry Hub sensitivity. Is this purely because of PDC and related to that on a macro level, if you can perhaps share your views on the 2024 outlook for Henry Hub, please. Thank you. Pierre Breber : So I'll start, Irene, and then Mike can take the macro. Yeah, it's a function of PDC, certainly, and then just continued the associated gas that comes along with the Permian. So as we're growing that, it obviously comes along with natural gas. Mike Wirth : Yeah. And Irene, the macro, I was pulling up the slide on the Henry Hub sensitivity. So broadly speaking, oil markets are pretty balanced right now. I think the geopolitics are the thing that are harder to call and could drive movements one way or another. It could be OpEx plus decisions. It can be this conflict in the Middle East. Economic growth in the world continues to be decent, and our outlook on demand growth for all this year is maybe not quite as strong as last year, but still growing. Gas is a little bit different. The inventories are high in the U.S. Inventories are high in Europe. We're kind of mostly through the wintertime, certainly through the riskiest period of the wintertime and now, there's these questions that are not going to really weigh in the market. In the near term, but maybe longer term, about exports out of the US and so all of that has got, gas markets under a little more pressure than oil markets or refined products and it's not unusual. Pierre was just talking about how we build the company to compete through the cycles and different parts of the portfolio basket. Petrochemicals are under some pressure right now as well and so at any point in time, we're going to find some of the fundamentals, probably under pressure. Others are looking pretty good and here in the short term, I think Henry Hub is in the under pressure category. Operator : We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning. If I look at the production guide of 4% to 7% growth on, say, $3.1 million, and I try to book in that between a fourth quarter closer to 3%-4%, and a 2025 where we're going to see TCO, FGP startup, plus hitting that million barrel a day milestone in the Permian, sort of implies there's an inflection point in production growth coming at some point, or perhaps there's a conservative guide for this year. Is that the right way to think about it? Mike Wirth : Well, coming into this year, we now have a full year of PDC that will be part of the portfolio. So that's pretty safe in terms of counting on that. I've already mentioned that fourth quarter was a little bit higher than maybe we even might have expected because we had high reliability. Some of these midstream issues we'd faced in the Permian had didn't repeat. We had this accounting catch-up thing in the Permian as well and we had a pretty light turnaround schedule in the fourth quarter. So it was a strong quarter all the way around. As we head into next year, we've got some asset sales in the guidance and, Bob, we've been at the low end. We've kind of ended up last couple of years hitting our guidance range, but at the low end and so I think you could probably think of this as being a little more comfortably in the middle of the range this year, given a number of the things that you mentioned. So, we try to give you guidance each year that we expect to hit, and we certainly expect to hit it this year. Operator : We will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Thanks for getting me in. My question, Mike, is maybe just on the Chevron return specifically trying to get a sense of, sounds like you will, but just want to get a sense if you'll continue paying out a majority of free cash flow for the remainder of this year and if the buybacks will continue to constitute, a bit over 50% of that payout? Mike Wirth : Yeah, Neil, we have not used some percentage or range of percentage of cash from operations as kind of a go by for distributions. What we've done is, have leaned on our track record on the dividend, first of all, and we've already clarified what you can expect this year with the 8% increase that we've announced. And then, I would point you back towards our upside and downside guidance that we've had out there now for a number of years, $10 billion to $20 billion on the range for buybacks and that's in an upside price case. We'd be up towards the higher end of that in a lower price case down at the lower end, both of which we can comfortably handle. We have indicated that post the Hess close, all other thing's equal, we'll see when it happens and how the world looks, when we get there, but we would expect to move from a rate of 17.5 to the top end of 20 because we're so confident in the long-term cash productive capacity of our portfolio and the strength of our balance sheet. So rather than focusing in on those percentages, I'd really point you towards the specific guidance that we've issued in the kind of the track record. Now, and of course, I think Pierre mentioned this in his comments. We do remain under SEC restrictions right now relative to the rate at which we can buy back and then we'll be out of the market when the Hess proxy is open and so all of these things are under normal times, we don't have one of those constraints on this. Pierre Breber : Hey, and I would just add, let me just add a little bit. It's fitting maybe my last words will be on share buybacks, six straight years of buybacks, right, 17 years out of the past 21 years, but we actually bought back more shares last year than the year before, even though earnings and cash flow were higher, right? There were records in '22, still strong in '23. That's the whole point. We're trying to be steady across the commodity cycle. We've heard from investors that buybacks should not be pro-cyclical. And it's hard to be counter-cyclical in the commodity business that has some price volatility. So being steady across the cycle is how we guide to it and these formulas, in fact, reinforce the opposite. They reinforce pro-cyclicality. So we're giving a return that in some ways is almost independent of prices within a range because we're could have paid more out in '22, but we held it back and we use some of that to pay in '23. We'll see where it goes, but the intent is to try to be steady across the cycle, either pro-cyclical nor counter-cyclical. Thanks Neal. Neal Dingmann : Pierre, great departure comments. Thank you. Mike Wirth : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Eimear Bonner, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Thanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron continues to deliver strong operational performance, maintain cost and capital discipline and consistently return cash to shareholders. First quarter marked 9 consecutive quarters with adjusted earnings over $5 billion and adjusted ROCE above 12%. During the quarter, we also returned $6 billion in cash to shareholders, the eighth straight quarter over $5 billion. We also grew production more than 10% from the same quarter last year and announced final investment decisions to grow our renewable fuels and hydrogen businesses. Earlier this month, we announced our third Future Energy Fund focused on venture investments in lower-carbon technologies. The merger with Hess is advancing, and we intend to certify substantial compliance with the FTC second request in the coming weeks. We believe that a preemption right does not apply to this transaction and are confident this will be affirmed in arbitration. We expect the proxy for the Hess shareholder vote to be mailed in April with a special meeting date in late May. This strategic combination creates a premier energy company with world-class capabilities and assets to deliver superior shareholder value, and we look forward to bringing the 2 companies together. At TCO, we had achieved start-up of WPMP this month with the first inlet separator and pressure boost compressor in service and conversion of the first metering station to low pressure now complete. Later this quarter, we expect a second pressure boost compressor online and a third gas turbine generator to provide power to the Tengiz grid. Metering station conversions are planned through the remainder of the year as additional pressure boost compressors start up, keeping the existing plants full around planned SGI and KTL turnarounds. We continue to make significant progress on FGP and expect to have additional major equipment ready for operations in the third quarter. Costs and scheduled guidance remain unchanged with FGP expected to start up in the first half of 2025. Now over to Eimear to discuss the financials. Eimear Bonner : Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter of strong earnings, ROCE and cash returns to shareholders. We reported first quarter earnings of $5.5 billion or $2.97 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.4 billion or $2.93 per share. Cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximate $300 million international upstream ARO settlement payment and $200 million for the expansion of the retail marketing network. We also had a working capital build during the quarter consistent with historical trends. Chevron delivered on all of its financial priorities during the quarter, an 8% increase in dividend per share; organic CapEx aligned with ratable budget inclusive of progress payments for new LNG ships; sustained net debt in the single digits while issuing commercial paper to manage timing of affiliate dividends and working capital; and share repurchases of $3 billion. Adjusted earnings were lower by $1 billion versus last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings were down due to lower realization and liquids liftings. Partly offsetting were favorable tax impacts. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower mainly due to timing effects associated with the rising commodity price environment. All other decreased on higher employee costs and an unfavorable swing in tax items. Adjusted first quarter earnings were down $1.3 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were down modestly. Higher liftings were more than offset by lower natural gas realizations. DD&A was higher due to the PDC acquisition and Permian growth. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower mainly due to lower refining margins and timing effects. Worldwide oil equivalent production was the highest first quarter in our company's history. Production was up over 12% from last year, including an increase of 35% in the United States largely due to the PDC Energy acquisition and organic growth in the Permian Basin. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we have planned turnarounds at TCO and several Gulf of Mexico assets. Following another strong quarter in the Permian, production is trending better than our previous guidance, and we now expect first half production to be down less than 2% from the fourth quarter. Impacts from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo and Richmond. We anticipate higher affiliate dividends in the second quarter largely from TCO. With the start-up of WPMP, we expect TCO's DD&A to increase by approximately $400 million over the remainder of the year. Share repurchases are restricted under SEC regulations through the Hess shareholder vote, after which we intend to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate. We've published a new document with our consolidated guidance and sensitivities that will be updated quarterly and posted to our website the month prior to our earnings call. Back to you, Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Maybe we could start with Tengiz because there's movement there. And specifically, the effects of the WPMP start-up, if you don't mind going into some detail. I think the market understands that it's FGP phase that really rerates kind of TCO's distribution capacity. But if there's any incremental benefits from WPMP starting up, whether it's reliability or potential to produce over nameplate or even just the CapEx run rate and what it means for maybe an annualized TCO distribution at this stage, that would be very helpful. Michael Wirth : Yes. Sam, let me talk a little bit to the project and operational dimensions of this, and then I'll let Eimear comment on the financial ramifications of that. So look, we're really pleased with the progress that's been making and pleased that we've begun the initial start-up of WPMP with the first PBF compressor online and processing crude through the plants after conversion of the first metering station. It's an important milestone. I'm proud of the team and the work they've been doing. They've done this safely. We're seeing initial operation that is well aligned with our expectations. In fact, we've been encouraged by very strong production response from the wells that feed into this first metering station. We now have the second metering station planned for conversion as off-line, and that conversion is underway. And as we bring on more of the PBF compression capacity, we'll complete more metering stations over the balance of the year. What happens here is we get higher production because the wells are now flowing against lower back pressure. And as I said, Sam, we've seen really strong response on this first set of wells. What that does is it gives us a high degree of confidence in keeping the plants full all year long with the fact being that we've got some turnarounds we have to do. We've got an SGI turnaround and a KTL turnaround, SGI this quarter, KTL next quarter, to do some tie-ins and some other normal maintenance. But in the periods in between those, it increases deliverability and the confidence of the plant will be full throughout that period of time. We've got a lot of project scope operational is the other thing that I just would remind you of. We're producing from new wells. We've got upgraded to new utilities now, gathering system, a new control center, power distribution system, 2 new, big-frame 9 gas turbine generators in service. So the reliability of the infrastructure and all of the control networks and everything is significantly improved as we got more modern equipment in place. So all of this reads through to higher degree of reliability, strong production performance. And last year was the second strongest year in the past several. So it gives us high confidence in delivering what we've said we'll deliver there. And then as we get into the third quarter, we'll start commissioning some of the process equipment as part of FGP, which, as you say, first half start-up next year is when you see the incremental production come online. So good progress all the way around. I'll reiterate that schedule and cost guidance are unchanged. And we'll continue to provide details each quarter on milestones and progress as we proceed. Eimear, maybe you can just talk about what that means financially. Eimear Bonner : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Sam, well, after years of investing, as the project starts up over the next couple of years, we do expect the CapEx profile to continue to decline, and that will enable free cash flow over the next couple of years to grow. With WPMP, it will keep the plants full. So this will allow IBS business to generate significant cash, and that will be available for distribution. With the second phase of the project then next year in '25, TCOs free cash flow is going to grow even further because with that phase of the project, we get incremental production. So what does this mean for Chevron? Well, we expect $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 and $5 billion in 2026. This is a $60 Brent. This will flow to us through a combination of dividends, so you'll see this come through cash flow from operations and loan repayments, which will flow through cash for investing. So we do expect dividends this year. We have guidance -- affiliate guidance to dividends for 2024. But we've also included in the deck today the outlook for affiliate dividends for the second quarter, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And a significant portion of that is an assumption around TCO. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : My question is really on the exploration program. Specifically, you have an interesting position in West Africa and Namibia. So maybe you can just give us some historical context of how you got involved here. Is this an asset that you see a lot of opportunity in, especially given some of the announcements from peers over the last couple of weeks? And how do you think about prosecuting it going forward? Michael Wirth : Yes. Thank you, Neil. We've got a nice portfolio of exploration opportunities around the world and including numerous prospects on Block 90 in the Orange Basin offshore Namibia, which lies just outshore -- outbound of where there was a recent discovery announced by another company. We're planning to spud the first exploration well in that block late this year or early next year based on rig availability. The rig will be completed in early '25. We farmed into another block, Block 82, which is further north in the Walvis space, and that was just announced earlier this week. And as you know, there have been a number of discoveries made by companies in the Orange Basin. Our block is on trend with those discoveries. We're encouraged by the success we see from others. And this is certainly an area where the industry has had a high -- a good batting average, a high degree of success. And we're pleased that we've got 2 blocks now offshore Namibia. And of course, we'll talk to you more as we get into the exploration program there. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : You guys did a small deal look like on the retail marketing asset, adding over 200 stations in the Gulf Coast and West Coast. I actually don't remember. I think since you've become the head of downstream, say, call it, 20 years ago, you guys have been selling asset there. So is there a change of your view in terms of the overall strategy we made to that part of the business? And whether that -- this deal you are going to be owning the asset or that this is wholesale marketing [ drop ] network type of deal that you are acquiring? Michael Wirth : Yes. Thank you, Paul. As you know, I come out of that part of the business. I love talking about retail. Look, we've got 3 really strong brands around the world. Caltex internationally; in Asia, primarily; in Middle East and Africa, a little bit. Chevron and Texaco here primarily in the Americas. And you're right, we only own about 5% in the U.S., even less than 5% of our branded stations. So most of our business is done through large retailers and distributors. We enter into agreements of supply agreements and brand agreements with these marketers. And there are times, different mechanisms, we use to support their investments. We've done a couple of deals here in the last quarter that are substantial, that add a few hundred stations to our network. And as part of that, we advanced some cash to support their brand conversion efforts, their investment in the network and to solidify our relationship with really important customers of ours that ultimately sell on to consumers. And so you saw that consume some cash.  It technically from an accounting standpoint doesn't get classified as capital, but we want to disclose it because it is cash. And it helps us grow our branded sales. And so it's an important part of our business. We're doing these kinds of deals all the time, Paul. They tend to be oftentimes smaller magnitude, so they don't necessarily get to a size where we would mention it the way that we did today. But we won't own these stations. They're owned by really strong independent retailers. Thanks for the question. Operator : We'll go next to Betty Jiang with Barclays. Wei Jiang : Mike, just -- so we're seeing that the U.S. operations look pretty strong quarter, especially with Permian holding in better than expected relative to your expectations. Could you just talk about what drove the better performance in the Permian and how you think the rest of the year unfolds? And then just anything else within the U.S. that you want to highlight? Michael Wirth : Sure. So yes, first quarter production in the Permian was good, 859,000 barrels a day, down about 1% from the fourth quarter of last year, stronger than what we had anticipated. Really good, strong performance in our company-operated business, building off the momentum from the fourth quarter of last year. We have seen reliability improvements that translate into a slightly less decline in our base production.  We saw a significantly shorter frac to POP cycle time, so between completed frac and when we put it on production. So that resulted in a few more wells being POP-ed in the first quarter, which you see in the production. Well performance itself was generally aligned with our expectations. And so we've been talking a lot about type curves the last few quarters. We're seeing strong performance that's aligned with or even a little bit stronger than what we expected.  And then we also saw some good contributions from our royalty acreage, which is the highest-return barrels we have because we really have no investment there and it's attractive acreage. Others are developing it. And we saw increased activity that resulted in increased royalty production.  NOJV, right on plan with what we expected and a lot of visibility into the non-operated joint venture portfolio for this year, more even than last year at this time, and confidence that, that will deliver. So all of that translated into a very strong first quarter.  Eimear mentioned that we now expect our first half to be better than we'd previously guided. We said 2% to 4% down versus fourth quarter of last year. We now think we'll be less than 2% down. And then, of course, the back half of the year, we had another frac spread. We've got more wells online and expect to exit the year around 900,000 barrels a day. So really strong performance there and consistent with the momentum that you've seen in prior quarters.  The -- I guess the other thing I would mention relative to the U.S. more broadly is the Anchor project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is we've guided towards midyear start-up of that. It's right on track. The floating production unit is being commissioned. As we speak, we've got both buyback gas and back oil in the facilities. So that means the pipelines, the process units are now charged with live hydrocarbons. We're commissioning some of the subsea infrastructure, including flow lines.  The completion of the first well is in progress. Second well is drilled and will be completed shortly. Third well is being drilled right now. So we'll talk more about this, but everything is right on track for start-up of Anchor midyear. And then, of course, we've got other Gulf of Mexico projects as well that are kind of stacked up right behind Anchor over subsequent quarters. So the outlook in the U.S. is especially strong. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS. Joshua Silverstein : You had around $1 billion of debt this quarter to manage some of the working capital and really distribution timing. Do you see the cash balance growing sequentially? Did you repay the commercial paper in 2Q? Just wanted to get a sense of where the cash outlook may go sequentially. Michael Wirth : Eimear, why don't you take that? Eimear Bonner : Yes. Josh, yes, so we had some commercial paper issued in the first quarter, and it was just to manage short-term liquidity. Timing of affiliate dividends can be a bit lumpy, repatriation of cash can be a bit lumpy. So this was normal business for us in the first quarter. I think in terms of what to expect in terms of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, we target to hold about $5 billion in cash, and that will bounce around as well. But I think $5 billion is a good number. We have access to lots of liquidity and commercial paper, bond investors, credit facilities. So while we've had higher cash in the balance sheet in the past, holding excess cash with low debt and lots of access to liquidity can be a drag in returns. So we're quite comfortable with the $5 billion cash, and that's a good number for you to focus on there. Operator : We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : I wanted to ask a follow-up on the Permian. So you put out there the updated well productivity slide, which is very helpful. But a few quarters ago, Mike, you talked about some of the broader constraints in the Permian, whether it's CO2, water handling and so on. It doesn't look like it's impacted your volumes in the near term, which have performed very well. So could you just refresh us on if anything has changed in your views on that there? Michael Wirth : Yes. Thanks, Biraj. Nothing's really changed. I mean this is a very large base business now with thousands of wells over a very large footprint. And it's important that we focus not only on productivity, efficiency and reliability and drilling and completions, but also in all aspects of operations. And that's midstream takeaway, it's gas processing, it's water handling.  And we've got more development underway this year in the New Mexico portion of the Delaware, which is going to require a build-out of some of this capability, which will be part of our capital program addresses. But you really have to stay on top of base business reliability on all these things. Seismic is another one we've seen some issues on.  And so they're all part of managing the business for safety and reliability each and every day. We had a quarter -- a couple of quarters back where a number of those things were a challenge. And the current quarter, we saw really good performance.  Last thing I might mention, which might be implied in your question, you see some talk about the takeaway capacity out of the basin and are people constrained, is that impacting particularly gas prices within the other commodities. We're covered on takeaway capacity out of the basin on oil, NGL and gas well out into the future. And so we're not exposed to any in-basin discounted pricing as a result of that. Operator : We'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Nitin Kumar : Mike, I just wanted to maybe get an update on Venezuela. There were some reports that Biden administration is reinstating some of the export bans on that country. Specifically said that Chevron was not included, but just your thoughts on sort of the future of oil production and exports from the country and how it would impact Chevron? Michael Wirth : Yes. Thanks, Nitin. So you might recall that the Department of Treasury and OPEC, a division within treasury, has issued a couple of different, what are called general licenses for operations for companies in Venezuela. There's one called General License 41, which primarily pertains to our position in the country. There's some specific licenses as well that kind of go along with that. And then there had been a second one that was issued subsequently called General License 44, which applied more broadly. That's the one where the administration has announced some changes. And those don't really impact us. There have been no changes to GL 41. And so we're not really affected by the news you've read about recently.  I'll just remind you, we're not putting new capital into Venezuela right now. All the spending is really self-funded from the cash from operations. We've been lifting oil and bringing it to the U.S., which has been helpful for the U.S. refining system, not just ours but others as well.  And since that license was issued now a little bit more than a year ago, we've seen production at the joint ventures that we're participating in increase from about 120,000 barrels a day at the time that, that license was issued to about 180,000 barrels a day now. So that's an update. There are some -- maybe it might be worth reminding just how the financial side of that works because it's a little bit different than some of the other parts of our production. So Eimear, do you want to touch on that? Eimear Bonner : Yes. Nitin, just as a reminder, for Venezuela, we do cost accounting, not equity accounting. So Chevron is not recording the production here or the reserves. We record earnings when we receive cash, and that shows up under other income and income statement. Just to put this into context, in 2023, the cash was modest, probably less than 2% cash flow from operations. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to ask about the divestment program. I know when the Hess deal was announced, you discussed $10 billion to $15 billion. But given that's in a bit of a holding pattern here, I'm just wondering what you expect the cadence or the target for divestments to be. I think historically, you've done about $2 billion a year. So that's not too far from what the guidance was with the Hess deal. Just trying to try and lay those 2 numbers and getting a sense of what the divestment program could look like while that deal is in a bit of a holding pattern. If you could just remind us the assets that have been discussed in the market, that would be great. Michael Wirth : Yes. Yes, sure. Happy to do that, Jason. So the first thing is you're right. We're always high-grading our portfolio. And it's not because we need the cash. You already covered the strength of the balance sheet. But it's really to set value to optimize our portfolio. We find times there are things that don't compete for capital in our portfolio and they fit better with somebody else.  They tend to be early-in-life assets. We were at Rosebank and divested that a few years ago or things that are much later in life and might fit better with somebody who works those kinds of assets.  Over the last decade or so, 2012 through 2023, we divested about $35 billion worth. Our long-term history has been about $2 billion per year, maybe 1% of our capital employed, give or take. And our guidance for this year is 1% to 2%, so it's pretty consistent with history. We did say that upon the closure of the Hess transaction, we're going to add some assets that are going to be highly attractive for capital investment. And that means as you look through the rest of the portfolio, if we stay capital-disciplined, there are probably some things that we might otherwise have invested in that now we would choose not to. And so that's where the 10 to 15 guidance came from. That would still stand upon closure.  The things we're doing now are things we would have done in the normal course. And so they're not really related to high-grading post the Hess addition. The things that are in the public domain, we talked about Myanmar, which we exited as of April 1. We've announced that we intend to exit the Congo, and we've got a deal there. We expect that to close before the end of the year. We have talked about our position in unconventionals in Canada and in Kaybob, Duvernay, which is a nice asset, which has some growth opportunities, but it may be a better fit for others. So we're looking at alternatives there. And then also the Haynesville, we paused our development activity in the Haynesville last year, and that's another one that we think may fit better with others. So I think those are the ones that are out in the public right now, Jason. Operator : We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Given the launch of Future Energy Fund III, can you give us a thought of what you saw success cases coming out of I and II that caused you to move to III? And maybe compare and contrast how you do it yourself in-house solar to hydrogen, for example, versus where you might see third parties to try new technologies. Michael Wirth : Yes. So I appreciate that. This is one that we probably haven't talked about with investors as much as some of the other parts of our business. Funds 1 and 2 were smaller, $100 million, $300 million. And they're not actually fully subscribed yet, but they're getting there, which is why we announced fund #3. We've been in the venture investing business for 1/4 of a century, so going back to the late '90s when we first set up our venture investing organization.  And in the Future Energy Funds, which are those that are really need on energy transition themes, through Funds I and II, we've invested more than 30 companies already. We're collaborating with 250 or so other co-investors in these companies. We can serve as a pilot bed for their technology so we can help them bring things from the lab and kind of bench scale out into the real world.  And I've visited last year, one of our carbon capture pilots in the San Joaquin Valley with a company that's got some really interesting technology to help us improve the efficiency, reduce the cost for carbon capture. And so we're looking at things like industrial decarbonization, hydrogen, emerging mobility, energy decentralization, the circular carbon economy. And what we're really looking to do is support innovation in things that we probably aren't doing within the company, within our own R&D or scale up. As you mentioned, the projects in the Permian Basin or in the San Joaquin Valley, the solar to green hydrogen is using established technologies that are well proven. What we're doing in our venture investing is trying to develop these new technologies, new materials, new novel ways to integrate AI and other kinds of technology systems to help solve some of these problems. And hopefully, we find things that will help our business and help the world.  Last thing I'll say is over the 25 years, we've more than earned our money back in our return on our investment. Not every one of these companies is successful, but we've seen a lot of technologies move into our business. We've seen a lot of the companies become successful. And there's a lot of innovation going on out there. This allows us to leverage ourselves into smaller start-up innovation that we might not otherwise see. So it's been a very, very positive for us, and we're excited to announce the new fund. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Can we talk a little bit about Eastern Med? I know at one point, operations shut down. It sounds like everything is back up and running. But also you would kind of tie that into Egypt a little bit, where there's been some exploration talk and in the government trying to do some things to improve the overall investment, I guess, environment there. Michael Wirth : Yes, you bet. So first of all, we are back in full operations in the Eastern Med. We've -- Tamar was down for about a month at the very beginning of hostilities. But we're excited about the opportunities there. Just to remind you, we've got the 2 existing platforms, Tamar and Leviathan, in service. And we've really structured our development plans there to focus on capital efficiency, higher returns, to the earlier answer, things we've got to compete for capital in our portfolio.  Since we've closed on the Noble acquisition, we've increased production at Tamar and Leviathan by more than 10% just through debottlenecking and reliability. We've sanctioned projects at both of those that are currently in progress that will increase production by another 40% over the next couple of years. And we're looking at larger expansion, particularly for Leviathan, where we've got a number of concepts that are being evaluated. Obviously, in the current environment, we're moving carefully with development of those.  You mentioned Egypt. We've got a discovery at Argus. We expect another appraisal well there in late this year or early next year to better characterize the field and refine our development plan. We've got a number of other blocks that have not been drilled yet that we shot a seismic on. And we plan to spud a well in Block 4 there before the end of this year. And so it's an area that I think has got real prospectivity. As you look at growth in both the near term, with the projects I mentioned and then the longer expansion of existing and exploration prospectivity, it's a part of our portfolio that I expect us to see growth from over the coming decade. Operator : We'll go next to Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. Francis Lloyd Byrne : I know we've covered a lot of ground this morning. We talked about the Permian productivity, which looks really good. But could you just touch on the DJ? And that production looks stronger than we expected. And then also any political risk you might want to comment on that there? Michael Wirth : Sure. So yes, first quarter production in the DJ was above 400,000 barrels a day, kind of higher than what our long-term guidance is. We had timing -- a lot of fourth quarter '23 wells put on production there. You'd typically expect some weather-related downtime in Colorado over the first quarter. We saw some of that, but less than what we had planned for. So production was good.  Second quarter, there's maybe some minimal impacts that we expect from a third-party gas plant that's had an outage. But continued strong performance there thus far in the second quarter. These are high cash margin, low-breakeven barrels that we're really pleased to have in our portfolio. If you go back 3 years ago, we didn't have anything in DJ. We were not talking 400,000 barrels a day of production there.  We plan to hold our plateau there around 400,000 barrels a day, and it will fluctuate a little bit based on the timing of bringing new pads on and completion of wells, et cetera. But it's a really strong asset for us.  Let me talk about the politics and kind of the operating environment a little bit, and then maybe I'll have Eimear just touch on PDC and the benefits of that. But Colorado is a state where energy is an important part of the economy. And I grew up there. The environment is very important to the people and the state as well. And I think their goal has been to be a leader in responsible development and to recognize the important economic contribution that our industry makes to the states. I'm confident that, that will continue to be the case.  We've got good relationships with members of the legislature, with the executive branch, with the governor. And as the largest oil and gas producer in the state with over 1,000 employees who live and work there and we were a significant investor there, we engage broadly within the community. And I think there's a recognition that responsible development in Colorado is what everybody wants and what we are committed to. And there's -- can be some noise around ballot proposals. There can be some noise around legislative proposals. But we're confident that the state is interested in working with us to be a responsible player and for this to be an important part of the economy. Eimear, maybe PDC, some of the benefits, just so people are reminded of that. Eimear Bonner : Yes. It's been about 9 months since we closed with PDC Energy. We're really pleased with the progress that we're seeing, the synergies. On the CapEx side, to date, we've captured $500 million, which is $100 million more than what we had initially guided to. We're also seeing capture on the OpEx side as well. So we're nearing $100 million there. The teams are continuing to integrate. We're bringing the best of both companies together and building a development playbook focused on optimizing returns in the basin. We're realizing strong free cash flow from these assets. So we're ahead of pace for the incremental $1 billion in annual free cash flow that we guided to. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : I wanted to bring it back to TCO. And Mike, I think you've talked in the past about how there is some similarity in the design between [ WPMP ] and FGP as a result of that. As you bring WPMP online, it helps derisk part of the FGP ramp as well. I was wondering if you could remind us what some of that commonality is. And as you look at the milestones you look out over the next few months at WPMP, which are the ones that you think about as being key to help derisk FGP as well? Michael Wirth : Yes. So it's -- just to remind everybody, this is a massive field. Some of you have visited it. And FGP, the Future Growth Project, is taking things we did almost 20 years ago now with the second generation plant in sour gas injection, where we injected about half of the sour gas. And we're now injecting all the sour gas, increasing production. And at the same time, we're reducing back pressure on the field and using compression to push the production into the facilities so that we're not relying on field pressure to do that. And that increases the life and longevity of the production out of the field.  The other thing this project brings with it is what I've described sometimes as urban renewal. And it takes infrastructure that was built back even before Kazakhstan was independent. And it brings power and utility infrastructure, control infrastructure up to modern-day technology and modern-day standards. So the projects are quite integrated. The start-up sequencing in terms of what you do to walk down systems, ensure they're ready for operation, do all the testing and start-up is very similar, whether you're in one portion of the project or another. And the productivity of the field resources that we see on WPMP reads across to FGP as well. And so while they're fundamentally different project scopes and objectives, so much of the work is similar across equipment and the commissioning and start-up activities that I think the positive progress we're making, the success we're seeing in commissioning and start-up at FGP reads straight -- at WPMP, reads straight across to FGP as well. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe one on the renewable side of your portfolio. I mean you announced FIDs on a couple of different renewable projects, one in biofuels, one in solar to hydrogen. Can you provide some color on what underpins confidence in these specific projects, whether it's commercial or technical or regulatory support? And do you see further opportunities to develop similar projects in the portfolio going forward? Or are there specific things about these ones in particular that make them attractive? Michael Wirth : Yes. So the 2 projects. One is an oilseed processing plant in our joint venture with Bunge. It's a project at Destrehan, Louisiana. And so FID was announced for a new oilseed processing plant there. This one will feature a very flexible design, and that's important because it gives you feedstock flexibility, which matters in any fuels manufacturing business. So in this case, we can process soybeans and softseeds, but we can also be able to process winter oilseed crops, things like winter canola, cover crest. And so it gives us a greater range of potential feedstocks that can then feed into our renewable fuels business, particularly the Geismar real diesel project, which will start up later this year. And it's really important that we have exposure across these value chains. The margins can move from the crush margin into the upgrading margin or what you consider the refining margin, into the marketing margin. And just like in our traditional business, being able to catch all margin across the value chain as it moves is important. Having flexibility, scale and reliability are important. So all of those underpin the investment decision there.  The project in California on green hydrogen is smaller in scale. And it really uses existing solar production capacity. We've got a 5-megawatt production facility in our Lost Hills oilfield in Kern County. And we're going to produce about a metric ton per day of hydrogen for retail fuel stations. So we're using existing infrastructure. We're integrating into the value chain. We've got another venture that is building hydrogen refueling facilities in California. And so we're leveraging existing assets, existing value chains and capabilities to invest here. As I say, smaller scale, and I don't want to overplay it, but it's very consistent with our strategy. And these things have got to start small and then scale. And so we're pleased with both of these. There are markets, maybe to your point about economics that are, in some ways, heavily influenced by government policy, be it the renewable fuel standard and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which affect renewable fuels or some of the things in the investment or the inflation reduction act that affect hydrogen. And so it makes them a little bit different than our traditional business, which really works off market fundamentals. But we look at a lot of cases there, and we invest in projects where we believe there's confidence that over time, we can generate a good return. Operator : We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : So my question is on West Coast refining. We now have one West asset producing gasoline on the West Coast, and TMX should be increasing the availability of heavy crudes once it's ramped. But it's a tough regulatory climate. And you're well positioned as one of the players that still has multiple assets in California. How are you thinking about that region today? And should we see structurally higher gasoline margins in California given we've had some capacity come out? Michael Wirth : Well, look, we've been in California for our entire existence, 145 years. We've got an integrated value chain that allows us to serve 2 competitive refineries and advantaged logistics that take us out into a market where we've got a very strong brand and where the demand for all forms of energy continues to grow, be it power, be it transportation fuels. It's an economy that is large and demand continues to go up.  That said, the policy environment has been one that is geared towards reducing investment in traditional energy, encouraging investments in these lower-carbon energies. And you've seen assets go out of the system, fossil fuel-fired power plants. There's a lot of questions about the one remaining nuclear power plant in the state. And you've seen refineries close down, as you say, some permanently, some to convert to uses, including to renewable fuels. And what that does is it creates a tighter supply-demand balance, particularly as demand continues to be strong and you need to have strong operations out of that entire system or you need to bring in supplies from somewhere else if you've got planned or unplanned issues that the system is dealing with.  And so on an average, what does that mean? It means margins are probably under more pressure. It means reliable operations are very important. And it's a place where we've operated for a long time and expect to continue to do so. But putting new investment into the state is a different question. And I think we've been pretty clear that we've got a global portfolio and we'll invest where we see the best conditions, and I wouldn't describe California that way today. Operator : We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Mike, can you help me understand a bit the sequencing of the base case on the Hess timetable? I've read all the documents, but just to get your sort of view. We've got a shareholder vote in May and we got limbo pending regulatory issues, but obviously, importantly, the arbitration. But maybe just talk about the arbitration timetable. Michael Wirth : Yes. So there are, I think, really 3 things, if you're looking at sequencing and timing here. One is the shareholder vote. And as I said, the proxy will be mailed out in April, and the shareholder vote will occur in May. You've got regulatory approval through the FTC, and we're making good progress on that. We're working closely with the FTC in respect to their role in the process and expect us to be substantially complete with that here by midyear.  And then we have the arbitration, which is, I think, a little bit less well defined at this point. The specific scheduling and time line will be established by the arbitration tribunal. In our S-4, we indicated that Hess has asked the tribunal to hear the merits of the cases in the third quarter with an outcome in the fourth quarter, which would allow us to close the transaction shortly thereafter. We see no legitimate reason to delay that time line. It's consistent with what Exxon has outlined is what they would expect. But I can't say that's exactly how it unfolds because we haven't seen specific scheduling from the tribunal yet. Operator : We'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : My question is on broad capital spend question specifically. Could you just maybe speak to -- do you have sort of broad strokes what percent of total spend would be directed towards the New Energies and maybe the Chevron technology ventures? And I'm just wondering how you think about margins, even though it's still early for some, how the margins of these compare to your higher-return traditional margin business. Michael Wirth : Yes. So there's a couple of kind of broad framing points, I think, to bear in mind as you think about that. Number one is we've guided to a long-term capital spend at around $16 billion. This year, we've got $15.5 billion to $16.5 billion as a range. And we intend to be very disciplined with our capital investment and only invest in the most attractive opportunities. We've also indicated that over a period of time, beginning in 2022 through 2028, I think it was when we announced our -- we had our energy transition spotlight, that we expected to spend about $10 billion in our New Energies business over that period of time, $8 billion in kind of the newer -- emerging business lines of carbon capture and storage, renewable fuels and hydrogen and then another couple of billion in decarbonizing our own operations and businesses.  It's not completely ratable. And that is a guide that we may or may not achieve. We may be a little below that, we may be a little above that, depending upon how these opportunities mature in new businesses. And to the earlier question, we need to be sure we've got confidence when we're putting capital, particularly large capital, some of the smaller things to help accelerate technology, learning, et cetera, like our venture investments, which tend to be a few millions of dollars in any particular company. We recognize the risk-return equation there. But larger investments, we've got to have a belief that this is a business that's going to deliver a return over time, and we're on the path to building a portfolio of businesses that will do that. And so that $10 billion is a guide, but we'll invest in things that make sense, and we'll explain the numbers if they end up a little bit different than that.  And so what that can tell you is the majority of our spend is still going into our traditional business because the majority of the world's energy is still provided by our traditional business, and we've got an obligation to meet that demand as long as it's there. But we're going to be very disciplined in what we invest in and only invest in the highest-return opportunities. And so each year, we issue specific guidance that we can -- you can look at. But longer term, I think you have to stay within those broad parameters and expect us to remain disciplined. Jake Spiering : We would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Thank you, Justin. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings conference call and webcast. I\u2019m Jake Spiering, Head of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Eimear Bonner are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Michael K. Wirth: Thanks, Jake. This quarter, Chevron delivered strong production and extended our track record of consistent shareholder returns. Production increased by more than 11% from the prior year and included a new quarterly record in the Permian. Over the past two years we\u2019ve returned over $50 billion to shareholders, approximately 18% of our market cap. We continued to advance growth opportunities in our traditional and new energies businesses through adding new exploration plays in West Africa and South America, achieving key milestones on the ACES green hydrogen project and commissioning of the Geismar renewable diesel plant expansion, which is expected to come online by the end of the year. The merger with Hess achieved a successful shareholder vote, and we now expect the FTC review process to conclude in the third quarter. The arbitration panel addressing the Stabroek JOA has set a hearing for next year. Hess had requested an earlier hearing, but the panel ultimately sets the schedule. We remain confident this is a straightforward matter and the outcome will affirm a preemption right does not apply. We\u2019re committed to the merger and look forward to combining the two companies. In the Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019re leveraging our deepwater expertise with plans to deliver high cash-margin, low carbon intensity production growth. First oil at Anchor is imminent, delivering the industry\u2019s first deepwater 20,000 pound development. The project is on-track to come in under budget while deploying multiple breakthrough technologies. After Anchor, three more projects are scheduled to come online and we expect production to grow to 300,000 barrels a day by 2026. Our developments have become more capital-efficient, unit drilling costs have come down and facility designs are optimized for high returns. As one of the largest leaseholders in the basin, we\u2019re well-positioned for the future with leading technology capability and attractive exploration opportunities near existing infrastructure and in frontier areas. In the Permian, base business performance continues to improve, with higher reliability and lower decline rates. Development activity continues to get more efficient. We\u2019re one of the first operators to deploy triple-frac, delivering cost reductions of more than 10% and shortening completion times by 25% where applied. In the Delaware Basin, company-operated well performance continues to improve as we optimize development strategies. In the Midland Basin, early well results are lower versus last year, our program in the second half of the year is more heavily weighted to development targets that we expect to perform better. With strong momentum in our operated portfolio and predictable results from our non-operated and royalty acreage, we now expect full-year production growth of about 15% and fourth quarter production to average around 940,000 barrels per day. At TCO, cost and schedule guidance is unchanged, with FGP expected to start up in the first half of 2025. We continue to bring major equipment online and complete key project milestones. Eight out of 21 metering stations have been converted to low pressure. Three Pressure Boost Facility compressors are in operation. A third gas turbine generator is in service. The first 3GP process system is ready for operation, and we completed the SGI turnaround on time and under budget. The wells converted to low pressure are meeting expectations and the Pressure Boost Facilities are operating with high reliability. Over the next two quarters, we\u2019ll continue converting the field to low pressure while further commissioning key equipment for FGP. The project team remains focused on completing the project safely and starting up reliably to deliver value to Kazakhstan, TCO and shareholders. This quarter was a little light due to some operational and other discrete items that impacted results, but I remain confident we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver on long-term earnings and cash flow growth. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eimear to cover the details. Eimear P. Bonner: Thanks, Mike. We reported second quarter earnings of $4.4 billion, or $2.43 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.7 billion, or $2.55 per share. Results in the quarter were impacted by downtime in Upstream that weighed on realizations, higher exploration expense and Downstream turnaround timing. Organic CapEx was $3.9 billion, in-line with budget. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio of 10.7%. Chevron generated solid cash flow of nearly $9 billion excluding working capital. Working capital lowered cash flow due to tax true-up payments outside the U.S. and a build in inventories. We expect about half of the working capital to unwind in the second half of this year, primarily in the fourth quarter. We again demonstrated our consistent approach to returning cash to shareholders with $6 billion of dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted earnings were lower by $700 million versus last quarter. Adjusted Upstream earnings were down mainly due to lower liftings, higher exploration expense and absence of favorable tax impacts from the prior quarter. Partly offsetting were higher realizations. Adjusted Downstream earnings were down due to lower margins and reduced capture rates, this was partially offset by timing effects. All Other decreased mainly due to a tax true-up. Versus last year, adjusted second quarter earnings were down $1.1 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings were flat, higher realizations and liftings were mostly offset with higher DD&A due to the PDC acquisition and the absence of prior year favorable tax items. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased mainly due to lower refining margins and higher turnaround and transportation OpEx. The Other segment was down primarily due to state tax adjustments. Worldwide oil equivalent production was up over 11% from last year due to the acquisition of PDC Energy and significant growth in the Permian Basin. Now, looking ahead. The third quarter will have heavier than usual maintenance with several turnarounds at Upstream assets, including TCO and Gorgon. Impacts from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo. There will be a one-time payment related to discontinued operations of around $600 million. We anticipate affiliate dividends to be around $1 billion this quarter. With the project in Kazakhstan nearing completion, we expect quarterly dividends from TCO moving forward. As a reminder, Chevron pays a 15% withholding tax on dividends from TCO which lowers both earnings and cash flow. Share repurchases are targeting the $17.5 billion annual guidance rate. Asset sales in the second half of the year are expected to be aligned with full-year guidance. Back to you, Mike. Michael K. Wirth: Okay. Thanks, Eimear. Today we announced we\u2019re moving Chevron\u2019s headquarters from San Ramon to Houston to enable better collaboration and engagement, both internally and externally. We also announced the retirements of Nigel Hearne, Executive Vice President, Oil, Products & Gas; Colin Parfitt, Vice President, Midstream; and Rhonda Morris, Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer after long and distinguished careers. I want to extend my sincere thanks to Nigel, Colin and Rhonda, for their service and their many contributions to our company. And finally, I\u2019d like to offer our deepest condolences to the family of our former Chairman and CEO, Ken Derr, who passed away three weeks ago. Ken\u2019s vision and leadership helped guide Chevron through momentous times to create a high-performing company with outstanding people and a portfolio that distinguishes our business to this day. Ken left an indelible legacy for our company and all those whose lives have been made better by his leadership. He will never be forgotten. Back to you, Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Please ask you to limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Justin, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thank you so much and congratulations to Nigel, Colin and Rhonda on their retirement. My question, Mike, was really focused around TCO. And, it sounds like we are making progress on that project, but this is a critical period of time during the summer productivity period. So, just would love your thoughts on how FGP is progressing. And then, as it relates to Kazakhstan, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions about the concession extension as we think about next decade and I recognize that\u2019s a long way away, but maybe you can help to address some of the investor debate around that topic as well? Michael K. Wirth: Sure. Thanks, Neil, and thanks for your kind remarks about our retiring executives. So, at TCO as I covered in my comments, we\u2019re really seeing steady and consistent progress. Work is being planned and liquidated in sequence, which is resulting in strong daily, weekly and monthly progress. I get a weekly report straight from the project team with a tremendous amount of detail. I\u2019m in regular contact with them, and I can tell you that they are really on top of their game. As I said, we\u2019ve got three of the pressure boost facilities up and running, the fourth not far away and WPMP is operating very reliably. So, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of the equipment. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the wells flowing at low pressure and its early days, but it augurs very well for the maintenance of strong production out of the field for a long time to come. On FGP, we\u2019re going to have additional FGP major equipment and systems ready for operations or started up later this quarter. And, we\u2019re just going to continue to work our way through that. We\u2019re moving in a more complex process units as opposed to some of the big rotating equipment and field metering station conversions. So, the nature of some of the startup work on FGP will be a little bit different. The other thing to recall is, we do have a large turnaround this quarter. So, good progress. The one thing that we won\u2019t compromise is safety or reliability in pursuit of schedule, but I can tell you that the team is all over that. With respect to the concession, we\u2019re really focused right now on getting this project up and running. The concession exploration is nearly a decade away, and the most important thing we can do is make sure that this big complex project is started up safely and reliably. To remind people that may not know, this is one of the world\u2019s deepest producing supergiant oil fields and it\u2019s the largest single trap producing reservoir in existence. So, TCO is very important to the Republic of Kazakhstan, it\u2019s very important to us and we\u2019ll certainly be in discussions with the government over time about potential extension. The key thing is an extension needs to create value for the country and it needs to create value for Chevron shareholders. We always seek that kind of an outcome. We\u2019ve extended concessions in other places where value was created for both parties. And then, there\u2019s been some instances over the recent period of time where we couldn\u2019t achieve the outcome and we did not extend. So, we\u2019ll be talking more about this subject over time, but right now we\u2019re really focused on project execution and continuing the strong performance on delivering FGP. Thanks, Neil. Operator : And, next is Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Thanks. Mike, this period of limbo around Hess is obviously a period you don\u2019t want to be in. It\u2019s not clear to me when the FTC rules or if they push out, until arbitration as I sort of previously indicated. But my question to you is, do you feel limited to do any other significant portfolio development in this interim period? I guess if the right opportunity came along that is? Michael K. Wirth: Yes. You could do something else if you wanted to. This is the transaction, that\u2019s the right transaction for us. And so, we\u2019re very focused on it, Alastair, and we\u2019ve made good progress with the shareholder vote, we\u2019re steadily marching along with the FTC, and I\u2019ve already mentioned the timeline on the arbitration. So, it\u2019s sometimes good things you have to work for and this will take a little bit more time than we had anticipated, but we remain confident in the outcome. And, as I tried to cover in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got a really strong queue of organic growth opportunities in flight right now. We didn\u2019t mention the Eastern Med, which is another one. So, we\u2019ve got projects in multiple regions of the world that are poised to deliver growth over the next three years, absent it we be at 10% growth in free cash flow, we\u2019ve got projects coming on in numerous basins in the world and in our chemicals business as well. So, we\u2019re really focused on that and creating value there. But, if another opportunity were to present itself that were compelling, we\u2019re certainly in a position to consider it. Thanks for the question. Operator : And, the next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Mike, can you talk about the potential for further cost efficiency gain? Where that you see over the next, say, two or three years the biggest opportunity? And, could you quantify that? I mean, how big is that opportunity set for you guys? Thank you. Michael K. Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Paul. I appreciate it. You and I have known each other for a long time. So, you know that capital discipline and cost discipline are near and dear to my heart and they always matter in a commodity business. Year-to-date and Q2 unit OpEx for us was about $16 a barrel, which is down about 5% from 2022. And, improving unit OpEx continues to be a focus. Some of the actions we\u2019re taking today driving down energy usage, which is a way to both reduce cost and emissions. At the same time in the Upstream, we\u2019re electrifying rigs in the Permian, we\u2019re lowering steam use at our San Joaquin Valley operations, in the Downstream we\u2019re implementing energy efficiency projects at our refineries that reduce gas consumption and power use. We\u2019re also optimizing supplier contracts, implementing a minimum functional objective approach to operations and maintenance activities at key assets like TCO and our LNG plants in Australia. And, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll continue to find new ways to increase efficiencies and reduce unit cost. Our plans would call for further unit cost reductions. And, I think you can look for us to use technology. For instance, the breakthroughs we\u2019re seeing in data technology offer significant opportunities for both efficiency, asset productivity, improved safety and other performance. And so, you can rest assured that I am focused on costs, we are focused on costs and you\u2019ll continue to hear more about that from us over time. Jake Spiering : Thanks, Paul. Michael K. Wirth: Thanks, Paul. Operator : And, the next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just go back to Kazakhstan and the FGP ramp up. So, I wasn\u2019t asking an operational question, but I appreciate FGP is on-track. But, it was related to the OPEC promises or curtailments. Kazakhstan this year has been a bit ahead of its quota, stated quota. If you take the headline figures from OPEC into next year, it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a huge amount of room in that quota to grow. And obviously, FGP is a fairly substantial project. So, just wanted to get your thoughts on any sort of issues or risks related to that? Thank you. Michael K. Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Biraj. So, obviously we are not party to those discussions. We comply with the requirements in any country where we operate including if they have some sort of production targets or requirements that they impose upon producers in the country. We have not received any indication from the Republic of Kazakhstan with regards to any curtailments relative to OPEC+. What oftentimes happens there is with the production in several big assets, you have turnarounds, projects and other things that create some degree of variability across multiple different producers and I think the Republic looks to manage that and fit their plan together. So, I don\u2019t have any unique knowledge about 2025, but we have a very close relationship. I will tell you that the TCO barrels, I think from a contribution to the Republic standpoint are very attractive and our intent is to produce at the full capacity any point in time for our facility in order to maximize revenue for the Republic and for Chevron. So, if there\u2019s further developments on that front, we\u2019ll certainly provide them, but we don\u2019t have anything from the government right now. Thank you. Operator : And, we\u2019ll take a question from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Mike. I\u2019m delighted to see you guys come to Houston. Welcome. But, if you want to stop by for coffee, let me know. But, Mike, I missed out on the last earnings call, and I apologize for bringing it up. I know it\u2019s highly sensitive and highly, I guess, subjective, but the issue around the delayed arbitration, I wanted to pose a question to you and see if we can get you to probe a little bit on this. ExxonMobil, regardless of their motivation, has stated that they have no interest in buying Hess. But, at the same time, our understanding is the bigger concern is global contractual rule for credibility, protecting that aspect of a contract. So, when I go into two months of the legalities, I wonder, is there a compromise that could cut short the arbitration timeline so you don\u2019t have to go to arbitration? For example, acknowledge you have a ROFR, but Exxon acknowledges they\u2019re not going to exercise a ROFR so everybody gets to protect your contracts for Exxon and secure your acquisition for Chevron. Is it a compromise that could cut the arbitration short is my question? Michael K. Wirth: Yes. Hey, it\u2019s great to hear a familiar voice back on the call, Doug, and I look forward to seeing you in Houston. What you have outlined is very sensible. It could be the foundation for something, but I really can\u2019t comment on specific conversations. I think we have indicated previously that there was a period of time where Hess and Chevron worked with the other partners in the Stabroek block to try to find a resolution here that accommodated everybody\u2019s interests and that time has now passed and we\u2019re in the arbitration process. So, that\u2019s the path that we\u2019re on. We sought something along the lines of an outcome as you described earlier, but it doesn\u2019t appear that, that is how this is going to end up. Everything is confidential obviously the language in the contract and contracts around the world have specific language and in each instance. I think the parties understand how that contract is written and how it would apply. So, I really can\u2019t say anything more about it than that. Jake Spiering : Thanks, Doug. Operator : And, the next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein : Hey, thanks, good morning, guys. Nice update in the Permian. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more details around increase in the fourth quarter outlook. Was this due to the new Delaware completion technique from Chevron? Any thoughts on non-op royalty volumes? And then, just looking at the Midland side, was there anything kind of specific as far as the zone or completion that you guys are now shifting away from to get increased productivity there? Thanks. Michael K. Wirth: Yes. So look, the Permian is performing strongly as you can see in the numbers. And, just to remind everybody about 80% of our program is in the Delaware. Delaware performance is up year-on-year and first half \u201824 production overall in the basin now averaged over 870,000 barrels a day, which is essentially flat or even a touch up from fourth quarter of last year. The drivers of that are improved performance across multiple dimensions of the business and in the base business we\u2019re seeing lower decline from proactive maintenance efforts, lower operated downtime, artificial lift optimization. I mentioned triple-frac earlier, which is reducing costs and increasing cycle time. So, the spud-to-pop cycle has shortened further. So, we\u2019re getting more pop days online than we might have a year ago and well performance as I said in the Delaware has been very strong. In the Midland, some of the first half pops have been a little bit below expectation. There\u2019s only a finite number of pads I could count them on one hand that are involved in this. And we\u2019re always moving into new zones, new acreage. And as part of that, we\u2019ve got an active learning and continuous improvement efforts to be sure we\u2019re optimizing development across the basin because it is not completely homogeneous. So, as we\u2019re testing new zones to better inform our future development plans, we learn. In this particular case, the learnings will be applied as we go forward. That said, it performed very well in the past. I think the thing you can pull up from that and look this is a big long-term asset that\u2019s got a lot of life ahead of us and we should be continually improving in it, so that over time we can deliver even stronger returns, stronger performance and we should be learning as we develop it as the basin matures and it\u2019s exceeding expectations for this year. We\u2019ve raised our full year guidance and we\u2019ve got great confidence in what we\u2019ll deliver in 2025. Thanks, Josh. Operator : And the next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Hey. Good morning. Michael K. Wirth: Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Good morning, Mike. And, yeah, welcome to Texas. If we could maybe dig into the Gulf of Mexico, as you said, the first kind of 20,000 PSI development. What are the -- given that it\u2019s new, what are some of the experiences you\u2019ve had or the industry has had with this level of pressure. And what are some of the things we should be watching for, maybe in another way of asking the question, how have you gotten comfortable on the technology side in terms of bringing this forward and developments behind it? Michael K. Wirth: Yes. I might make a couple of comments on that and then ask Eimear who before becoming our Chief Financial Officer was our Chief Technology Officer. The moving into that pressure regime, obviously you need bigger equipment because you got to contain higher pressures, you\u2019ve got greater wall thickness on all your equipment, it\u2019s heavier, you need heavier hook loads to lift and deploy equipment. You\u2019ve got a lot of technology qualification to satisfy our own standards and to satisfy the regulator that every element of your kit is proven at pressures well beyond what anything that it will see in service. So, this goes from components large to small and you get into tighter tolerances and a whole host of things as you step up the pressure regime there. So, I would say that we\u2019ve worked closely with some of our suppliers who have developed the specific equipment that is in place and we\u2019re very pleased with everything from the drilling rigs and the equipment that\u2019s used in drilling to trees and production kit both subsurface and surface. Eimear, you might have some thoughts from your technology days to share with folks. Eimear P. Bonner: Yes. Mike, you hit on one key thing and that is that the partnership that was demonstrated here with ourselves with industry partners to be able to deliver the first 20ks subsea development. And to your question in terms of how did we get comfortable, I think it was because we brought the best of our engineers, the best of our suppliers, and the best technology that we had, several examples of technology, proprietary technology that we brought. And the extensive, testing, quality testing that took place before we went out to the field. So, some things to mention, just to put that in perspective, we delivered the first 20k subsea well completion and subsea production trees and manifolds. So, this is the core equipment that protects us from loss of containment and ensures that we safely and reliably can operate the field. We drilled wells. We developed a drilling rig. We built a drilling rig with our partners to enable drilling at these depths and the equipment to allow us to do that. That had very special dynamic positioning and technology as well. On the subsurface side, when we think about the prospect and how we were able to see the prospect and get some a really good accurate image of the prospect, we used our proprietary seismic technology here. This is more of our in-house Chevron proprietary technology to help us with that image and that enabled us to make the right decisions about the development and optimize the development. So, those are just a couple of examples of where the surface and the subsurface technology really enabled us to achieve this outcome. Operator : And the next question will come from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Eimear, I wanted to stick with you, and I have a bit of a strategy question for you. If we kind of put together several of things that\u2019s been talked about on this call so far, the TCO start up, strong Permian production growth, rising production in the Gulf of Mexico, it all kind of materializes in the form of this inflection in free cash flow as we go into 2025 and beyond. And Chevron has historically had four, I think, very consistent priorities for use of cash. But now that you\u2019ve had some time in the CFO\u2019s team, I was wondering if you could talk about your views for the optimal use of cash, especially in the context of your current low leverage levels and how you\u2019re thinking about the trade-off between further dividend growth or more buybacks as cash flow rises over the next few years? Eimear P. Bonner: Yes. Thanks, Devin. Well, I\u2019m thinking about it consistent with how we have for decades and consistent with our long-standing financial priorities. So, just to step through them, first, it\u2019s growing the dividend, that\u2019s our first priority. So, cash that enables us to continue with our track record of growing the dividend for 37 years. So, that\u2019s the first priority. And when we look at the projects that we have and the growth that\u2019s underway that Mike talked about, our 10% free cash flow growth really supports future dividend increases. So, when we think of cash, that\u2019s where it goes, first and foremost. Secondly, is to invest in the business to deliver profitable growth and do that capital efficiently. This is an area of leadership for Chevron when you look at the percentage of the CapEx as a percentage of CFFO. So, I\u2019m focused on ensuring that we maintain leadership in this area. To your point about the balance sheet, our third priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we are currently under levered and we expect and are comfortable to modestly relever over time, but to stay within historical ranges. And we look at our balance sheet as an asset to create value, and manage volatility and ensure steady capital returns through the cycle. And when we\u2019ve satisfied all three of the financial priorities, the fourth is to return surplus cash to shareholders through buybacks and that\u2019s what we intend to do and we take a multi-year view of that considering a range of commodity prices. So, in my time with the company in the business side and on the corporate side, I\u2019ve seen how these financial priorities have served us well and they\u2019ll continue to serve us well. And so in my time, they\u2019re not going to change. Thanks. Operator : And the next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Nitin Kumar : Hi, good morning, Mike, and thanks for taking our questions. I want to maybe shift focus on the downstream side. Last quarter you had a heavy turnaround schedule and just the way cracks worked out, it probably wasn\u2019t the best timing. As you\u2019re coming out of that turnaround, what are you seeing in your markets? And if you can maybe touch on renewable diesel specifically with Geismar coming on later this year, what\u2019s the outlook for economics of biofuels? Michael K. Wirth: Yes. So, you\u2019re right. We had some turnaround activity in the second quarter that occurred during the more attractive margin portion of the quarter and then we had more capacity back online as margins dropped precipitously in some cases. So, we didn\u2019t capture as much as we could because of the timing of some of our activity. Globally product demand is decent. Overall demand for oil is going to be up 1% to 2%. Most products have recovered to pre-COVID levels plus or minus. And we see, I think decent economic growth underway around the world. We\u2019ve had some new refining capacity come into the system in the Middle East, in Africa, in Mexico, and in Asia. So, it\u2019s coming online, so it\u2019s in startup. So, you\u2019re seeing some capacity come online and inventories have all risen over the first half of the year and they\u2019re at or above five-year levels. For some period of time, we\u2019ve been of the view that margins were going to revert towards mid cycle by this year or next year and that\u2019s certainly I think what we see going on in some cases. Mid cycle has been pretty tough in some parts of the world and we\u2019re back to pretty tough margins. And that\u2019s maybe a way to transition to renewable fuels, where these are markets that are heavily influenced not just by supply and demand, but also by policy, because a lot of the value is driven through the credits associated with those. We\u2019ve seen periods of time in the past where the targets didn\u2019t come out of EPA until after the compliance year had already ended, which was challenging. We\u2019ve now seen APA get ahead of the game and set numbers well out into the future. And it\u2019s hard for people to anticipate markets. And so right now what we\u2019ve got is a market where a lot of capacity has been incentivized and we don\u2019t have the RBOs that necessarily match up with it. So, in an over supplied market credit values are down both at federal level and at state level. We welcome to our margin business. This is the way value chain businesses work at least through my career, much of which has been in the Downstream and you need to be prepared for it. And you need to have a capital efficient investment philosophy, which we do. Some of our refinery investments have been to create flexibility to move back and forth between fossil feed and renewable feed. We\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve idled some plants, which you do when you\u2019re in a period like this and we\u2019re completing the Geismar project, which will give us scale and importantly feedstock flexibility. And in the margin business, you need to have access to affordable, competitive and reliable feedstock. The flexibility that Geismar will have will allow it to compete very well. We\u2019ve got another project underway, a joint venture with Bunge to move back into the bean crush portion of the value chain, which further helps us assure competitive supply into Geismar. But this is a business where we\u2019re going to see periods of time where margins are tough and you probably see some competitive capacity under pressure and so that shutdown and over time then they\u2019ll tend to cycle the other way. So, we\u2019re in this business for the long haul. We think drop in renewable fuels are going to be part of creating a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we\u2019re very committed to that business through good times and through the challenging times we\u2019ll be pragmatic, efficient and value chain oriented in optimizing that business. Operator : And the next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You guys have built out a pretty larger exploration portfolio the past few years and I think you\u2019re starting to delineate some of that acreage. And I\u2019m wondering, out of the positions you\u2019ve amassed around the world, what you\u2019re most excited about? And then related to that specifically on Namibia, there\u2019s a lot of interest in the market about that region. Could you remind us what your drilling plans are for that region this year and any interest in consolidating the space given a number of small and large players over there? Thanks. Michael K. Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Jason. You\u2019re right. We have added some new acreage to our portfolio and some acreage that\u2019s in areas that are kind of more frontier than some of the stuff we\u2019ve historically held. Look, we\u2019re excited about I\u2019m excited about any number of regions in the world. I\u2019ll start with the Gulf of Mexico where we\u2019ve got projects lined up as I mentioned earlier and a lot of expertise. We\u2019re one of the largest leaseholders in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And as we move into these higher pressure regimes, we\u2019re well positioned to continue to have exploration success and development success there. The second one I\u2019ll point to is the Eastern Mediterranean, where we\u2019ve got interesting acreage in the offshore western portion waters off of Egypt. We\u2019ve got some plans to drill there. We\u2019ve got a discovery where we\u2019ll do a delineation well on the Nargis discovery. And then the third one I would point to is West Africa and that would include existing positions in places like Nigeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Namibia, where there\u2019s certainly been a lot of interest lately in Namibia. We\u2019ve seen others make some discoveries. In the Orange Basin, we\u2019ve got a lease PEL 90, which sits just outboard of where an interesting discovery has recently been made. And we\u2019ve got a well there that will spud in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be completed in early 2025. We\u2019ve already executed the Reagan well construction contract. So, we\u2019re very excited to see what that delivers. In terms of additional acreage in Nigeria, we farmed into a block in the Walvis Basin, PEL 82 and are interested in continuing to add to our acreage position there if opportunities present themselves. So, we\u2019ve got three ways of bringing resource into the company. You can explore for it and discover it. You can acquire it or you can unlock it through technology and all three of those receive lot of attention. We\u2019ve got talented people working in each area to bring resource in through all of them. But I\u2019m excited about some of the new exploration acreage that we\u2019re adding. Thanks, Jason. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Bob Brackett : Good morning. I had a question given that you have a unique position in Venezuela and we\u2019re watching an election and a post-election unfold. Any comments on what you\u2019re seeing from your folks on the ground? And maybe if there\u2019s any vision, what your role in Venezuela could look like in a range of presidential outcomes? Michael K. Wirth: Yes. Bob, on the ground, what we\u2019re doing is really monitoring the situation. You\u2019ve seen the news coverage and our focus remains on the safety of our employees and their families and the integrity of the assets in our joint venture operations. We\u2019ve been a constructive presence in Venezuela for most of the last 100 years. We conduct our business there in compliance with their laws as well as the laws of the U.S, which in this particular case are administered under a general license issued by the Treasury Department. And we\u2019ve seen some encouraging results here recently since the issuance of the most recent general license, our JVs are produced around 200,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re being repaid debt that we have been owed and are steadily achieving that objective. We\u2019ve also seen the extension of some of the concessions on some of these non-operated joint ventures that we are involved in. So, we remain apolitical in Venezuela and in other countries. We\u2019re there to help develop the economy, support the people, create jobs and not get involved in politics which can swing in any country from party to party. And we have found that it\u2019s best to work with the government that\u2019s in power, respect the fact that that is the government that we have, but not take positions that would make it difficult for us to continue to work with a subsequent government. So, we don\u2019t have a role in selecting governments, we\u2019re a commercial player, not a political player. And again, our focus is really on keeping our people safe and the assets protected. Thank you, Bob. Operator : And next is Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Thanks for getting in. Mike, my question for you and the team is just on OFS costs. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in prices given the very recent fall in oil prices. And if so, or just going forward, would you expect to see maybe domestic cost hold while international stays firmer or vice versa? Michael K. Wirth: Yes, certainly in the economy broadly speaking, we have seen inflation pressures easing and I think that\u2019s good for consumers, it\u2019s good for economic growth. These things vary across geographies and as you say, you can see different dynamics in the onshore and the offshore. We are seeing some softening of pressure in the onshore, some declining in prices for oil country or oil class tubulars, rigs, prop and trucking. Some of the frac services are more stable. We have a contracting approach that generally sets up index-based pricing over longer periods of time which tends to buffer increases. It can also buffer the decreases. So, we\u2019re not a big spot player. We tend to have longer term contracts and look for things that allow our suppliers to plan their work and allocate their people and resources accordingly. And some of these things lag on the way up, they lag a little bit on the way down. But I think in the onshore, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re seeing some easing of pressures. I think in the offshore, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a reverse. There is more activity going on in the Deepwater. You\u2019re seeing rig rates firm in some cases. So, this is a place where we also take a longer term contracting approach. We\u2019ve got multiple rigs contracted out over multiple years. They are typically laddered, so that they don\u2019t expire simultaneously and we\u2019ve lagged into the market across the cycle, so that we\u2019re not exposed to any one particular point in time. So, certainly not the inflationary pressure we\u2019ve seen a couple of years ago. Thank you, Neal. Operator : And the next question comes from Geoff Jay with Daniel Energy Partners. Geoff Jay : Hey, guys. This is, maybe a follow-up to Jason\u2019s question about exploration earlier, but I noticed you got involved in Uruguay back in March. Is that an analog to the Orange or Walvis basins? And just wonder if you can maybe update us on what you think the potential could be there and what the timeline of exploration might be there? Michael K. Wirth: Yes. So, we did pick up a block off Uruguay and there are beliefs that there are certain conjugate margin analogs that we see on the South American side of the Atlantic. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done to explore those theories and in some instances we have seen evidence that supports it in other instances less so. So, we\u2019ve also picked up some acreage in Brazil, in Suriname. So, across that whole Eastern Coast of South America, we have got some pretty good exposure and intend to do the geotechnical work and seismic work to understand the prospectivity of it. So, very early days on that particular prospect, but we\u2019re intrigued by it and it\u2019s an example of what I mentioned earlier that we\u2019re moving into some areas that are a little more frontier than where we\u2019ve been over the last number of years. Operator : And the next question will come from Betty Jiang with Barclays. Betty Jiang : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the Permian. It\u2019s great to see the momentum, the operational momentum you\u2019re seeing on the operator side. Just given the triple fracs and certainly acceleration of the cycle time, curious how you think about this, pull forward of activity. Would you likely to do more with the same equipment, or would things slow down or ended up using less equipment? And also curious about what you\u2019re seeing on your royalty and non-operated production front as well? Michael K. Wirth: Okay. Let me start with the royalty and non op first. We\u2019re continuing to see strong contributions from that. We\u2019ve got line of sight to essentially all the AFEs this year across that acreage and it\u2019s been if you want to call it the upside performance we\u2019ve seen this year has been spread across all three of those portions of our business, company operated royalty and NOJV. So, strong contributions from those two. When you get to the Permian, yes, these efficiencies have accelerated activity. We get through more lateral feet of wells, we complete more feet, we use more consumables and sand and everything as we do that. Some of the easing of pressure on cost of goods and inputs helps us offset that and so we are trying to manage, we are going to manage to our CapEx numbers. And you can expect us to balance out activity and capital. We\u2019re not going to get off to the races on capital. We\u2019re going to see very disciplined out of the budget is a budget. But the nice thing is we\u2019re getting -- because of the improved cycle times, improved efficiencies, we\u2019re getting more productivity out of the equipments, we\u2019re getting more production per unit of capital input and that really is the story here. So, you can expect us to land our capital as we\u2019ve guided it at close to $5 billion and the production as we have guided in our prepared remarks. Operator : And our last question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question is just if you could give some color on the downtime you saw both Gorgon and Wheatstone in 2Q. What was the source of those outages? And how are the facilities running now? And maybe include some color on the planned work you called out for Gorgon in 3Q? Eimear P. Bonner: Yes, John. So, the down time in upstream in May and June was associated with some unplanned events in Gorgon and Wheatstone. So, on Gorgon, there was a blade failure. So, they had to take some time to repair that. They used the time when they were down to try and do as much maintenance as possible. On Wheatstone, they actually had a gas leak that was discovered by an operator. And we\u2019re always going to shut the plant down and repair any leaks in the spirit of operational excellence. So, they repaired that, it was on the fuel gas system and got things back up and running. So, the repairs were executed safely and efficiently and we still expect both of those assets to run with good reliability this year with top quartile performance. The Gorgon, asset turnaround is currently underway and that\u2019s going really well. So, we expect that to come in under the planned duration this quarter. And even with or despite the downtime, we expect to close the full year and deliver on the plant production for the combined Australia assets. Michael K. Wirth: Thanks, John. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today\u2019s call. Please stay safe and healthy. Justin, back to you.

Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on slide two. Now I will turn it over to Mike. Michael Wirth : Alright. Thanks, Jake. This quarter, Chevron delivered strong financial and operational results, returned record cash to shareholders, and achieved project milestones that are expected to deliver production and cash flow growth over the coming years. We continue to see strong performance in the Permian, executed major turnarounds at TCO and Gorgon ahead of schedule. Worldwide production increased by 7% from the prior year and set a third-quarter record. We started up the high-pressure anchor project and began water injection to boost production at the Jack Saint Melo and Tahedi fields. These projects, combined with additional project startups through 2025, are expected to grow Gulf of Mexico production to 300,000 barrels per day by 2026. We have expanded our CO2 storage portfolio, adding over two million acres offshore Western Australia. In September, the FTC completed its review of the company's merger with Hess. We also recently announced several asset sales as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts. This quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the PDC Energia Position. We have successfully combined the two companies, taking best practices from both and applying them across our shale and tight portfolio. We have exceeded our guidance of $500 million in combined capital and cost synergies by more than 30% and have delivered more than $1 billion in incremental free cash flow since acquiring PDC. Jurn's well performance is 40% better than the DJ Basin average, and we continue to optimize development plans. We have advantaged inventory, with around 75% of locations at a breakeven below $50 per barrel. We expect to hold production at a plateau around 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through the end of the decade. Our operations in Colorado are among the lowest carbon intensity in the industry, benefiting from tankless production facilities that lower greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to older designs. Where possible, we utilize grid-powered rigs that reduce more than 60% of our on-site greenhouse gas emissions from drilling. At TCO, the team continues to deliver consistent progress on project milestones. All four Pressure Boost facilities are now online and operating with high reliability. All production is flowing through these facilities, which allows optimization of existing plants and enabled the highest daily production in the field's 31 years of service. Remaining metering stations are all under conversion, and we are confident in the incremental well capacity that will feed FGP. We have initiated final leak testing for the wet sour gas compressors and are preparing the crude processing systems for operation. Complex commissioning activities will continue over the coming months, leading into initial startup activities in the first quarter of 2025. We continue to divest non-core positions at significant value. We have announced asset sales in Canada, Alaska, and Congo, which will contribute before-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion pending regulatory approvals. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter. In Canada, we received a compelling offer for our Kaybob Duvernay shale position and non-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands project. Both are good assets, and we have a long history there, but they are a better fit for a reputable counterparty and an attractive deal value for Chevron. Now, I will turn it over to Eimear to discuss the financials. Eimear Bonner : Thanks, Mike. We reported third-quarter earnings of $4.5 billion or $2.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.5 billion or $2.51 per share. Organic CapEx was $4 billion for the quarter, in line with our budget. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio under 12%. Cash flow in the third quarter was the highest for the year despite lower oil prices. Working capital decreased by $1.4 billion on lower inventory levels. Share repurchases were a record $4.7 billion at the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Our financial priorities are unchanged, and we plan to use our strong balance sheet towards shareholders consistently through commodity cycles. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down about $150 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were down mainly due to lower realization and high dividend at TCO, partly offset by higher lifting. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing effects and higher US volumes. This was partially offset by lower US refining margins. Adjusted third-quarter earnings were down $1.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were flat. Lower liquids realizations and higher DD&A were mostly offset by higher liftings and timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased mainly due to lower refining margins. All other was down primarily due to interest expense. Third-quarter oil equivalent production was up around 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Strong production in the Permian, primarily in our company-operated New Mexico assets, was the main driver. We expect full-year average production growth to finish at the top end of our guidance range of 4% to 7%. Costs always matter in a commodity business. We have a track record of managing unit costs well below inflation while successfully integrating several acquisitions. Higher returns require competitive costs and safe and reliable operations. Executing turnarounds on budget and on schedule is a key performance driver, and we have delivered outstanding performance in 2024. Our teams have collaborated across upstream and downstream to standardize the approach to these complex maintenance events, increasing the days our facilities are online and lowering unit costs. While we anticipate significant volume growth in the years ahead, we also expect to deliver $2 to $3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including the expanded use of global capability centers. Now looking ahead, in the fourth quarter, Upstream will have downtime, which is expected to be split between US and international operations. Impacts to production from divestments are expected to be around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. Downstream, we will have higher planned maintenance primarily at El Segundo and Pasadena. We will also have a shutdown at the Pasadena refinery, enabling the light tight oil expansion to come online. We anticipate affiliate dividends to be around $1 billion this quarter. Share repurchases are expected to be between $4 and $4.75 billion in the fourth quarter, unchanged from prior guidance. Proceeds from asset sales are expected to be about $8 billion before taxes. Back to you, Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Justin, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. If you have a question at this time, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. To allow for questions from more participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star two. If you are listening on a speakerphone, we ask you to please lift your handset before asking your question to provide optimum sound quality. Again, if you have a question, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. And our first question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. Good morning. The main feedback I have heard from investors hesitant on Chevron is wanting resolution on TCO startup and test. At what point should investors consider TCO startup largely derisked? Is there, like, a specific milestone in the commissioning and startup process, like where you have listed here, where you say, okay, startup probably really cannot slip much from here, and are we there now? Michael Wirth : Yeah. So thanks for the question. You know, we are making great progress, and I think you saw that again this quarter as we have had several quarters now where we have laid out expected milestones and delivered on them. So the team is delivering predictable commissioning and startup activity, and I ran through some of the current state relative to low-pressure production, strongest day of production ever, etcetera. That said, there is still significant complex commissioning work ahead, particularly on the future growth project. That work is well underway here, and we expect, as we said, to begin startup procedures in the first quarter. So our cost and schedule guidance is unchanged. You know, one of the key things for us, and this is a learning from other projects over the years, is to ensure reliability. We want to make sure that we have everything ready to start up safely and then run reliably as we go forward. And so we are going to continue to be very methodical in the way we go about starting up the equipment there. But every quarter that passes, it is being derisked. I do not know that there is a magic threshold you can say it is entirely derisked, but everything we see is very positive. In fact, Eimear was there just recently along with Mark Nelson. Maybe, Eimear, you can share some of the things you saw at TCO. Eimear Bonner : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And, yeah, it was great to be back and to be with Mark and Jake and the team in Tengiz. When we were there, they actually achieved a key milestone the day we arrived in Tengiz, and that was when they fully transitioned to feeding all of the existing six production trains with low-pressure production fed through the pressure boost facility. So I think the fact that the production was at high levels producing through the pressure boost facility just shows the high reliability that has been achieved there. We also visited three sites at Tengiz, Jean Ann. The first one was the operations and control center, and there, we saw how they are leveraging the advanced process control technology, digital tools to really optimize production, keep the plants full, and plan work safely. So that was great to see that to be part of the project, and it is really enabling a whole new level of optimization. We went to the sites that Mike talked about where the complex commissioning is ongoing. So the third generation site, there is a large, high number of equipment that is being commissioned there. So we talked to the team about the high diligence they are being to ensure that we do the performance testing on the equipment, we commission the equipment, and we do that in a very methodical way. So that was great to see. We also went to the third generation injection facility. And with the design that we have, we will be injecting all of the produced gas into the reservoir to help with pressure management. And they were doing injection testing when we were there. So that is a key bit of derisking to know that the wells will take the sour gas into the back end of the reservoir. So overall, it was a great visit. You know, we came away really encouraged by the work of the team, by the consistent progress that is being achieved, but also by the just the rigorous planning and thought that is going into ensuring a safe and reliable startup and ramp-up over the first half of 2025. Thanks for the question, Jean Ann. Operator : And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, Mike and team. I just want to spend some time on the Permian. You had indicated in the prepared remarks that you expect to finish towards the top end of the 4% to 7% range in guidance. And you highlighted strength in company-operated New Mexico. Can you spend a little bit more time unpacking that, the sustainability of that, and just how should we think about the path to ultimately getting to plateau at this asset? Michael Wirth : Yeah. Neil, we did have a nice strong quarter again in the Permian. I realize a lot of our activity now being in New Mexico, the data is not quite as timely and transparent maybe as on the Texas side. And so you may not see that, but a couple of things. Number one, our new well performance has been very, very strong in the Delaware Basin. We have got a lot of that in the third quarter, particularly, we are in the second Bone Spring. And seeing top quartile performance out of those wells. Also on the Texas side and the Delaware and the Wolf Camp A, we are outperforming expectations. So new wells and completion of pop time on those new wells have been very, very strong. In the base business, we are seeing stronger reliability performance, proactive maintenance efforts are paying off. We are seeing artificial lift optimization now sustaining strong production. And we are seeing efficiency gains in everything from completions designs, coordination, and logistics to reduce mobilization. We have talked about triple frac before. And so across the entire activity portfolio in the basin, we just continue to see improvement in the execution of that and then improvement in the performance of the wells. As we move towards the, you know, the million barrel a day mark next year, we will begin to shape our profile there a little bit towards a plateau. And we will really begin to focus on free cash flow. And so growth will become less the driver, and free cash flow will become more of the driver, if you will. So we will bring capital spending down, and I think what you will see is this year is probably going to be the peak in Permian CapEx. And as we move forward, we will start to attenuate that. The growth, which has been at a, you know, a 15% CAGR for the last three years, probably going to be higher than this year, will begin to attenuate as well, and we will really open up the free cash flow there. So more to follow. In terms of exactly what that looks like. I am sure people are curious about that. So we will provide more guidance here, you know, over the next call or two, so you can start to think of what that looks like. But the, you know, the headline here is continued efficiency and productivity gains, strong free cash flow today, and we are going to manage it for even stronger free cash flow in the future. Operator : And the next question will come from Doug Leggett with Wolfe Research. Doug Leggett : Good morning. Sorry. I had a frog in my throat, Mike. I appreciate the opportunity to ask you a question. You know, if I could observe as a kind of precursor to my question, this is probably your best operating quarter in quite a while, so congrats. The share price is responding accordingly. But if you look at your relative underperformance since you announced the Hess deal, it is clearly a huge, you know, weight of uncertainty on the stock. It basically wiped out the value of Hess. So it is a Hess question. And it goes something like this. You have now got FTC since we last spoke in the last call. You have got the shareholder vote, and you are moving ahead with I guess, what many would think with the post-Hess acquisitions disposals. Synergies presumably are not related to Guyana. Why not go ahead and close the deal if you are so confident in your legal position? Michael Wirth : Well, look, the relative performance of the shares relates to a lot of things. Number one, and so I would not dispute the fact that the Hess uncertainty is a material contributor. But as you said, we have had some performance unevenness that I think we have, you know, ironed out and we need to prove that. But you know, we announced the cost and schedule update to TCO during this period of time. So there have been a number of things that I think are all part of that, all of which are a high priority. And as you see today, we are getting a lot of attention and I think improving. Look, we have got a deal structure with Hess that has a condition precedent that if there is an arbitration, the arbitration has to be concluded. We are confident that it will be successfully concluded, but you know, that is where we set the deal up and we are going to execute the transaction the way the transaction is written and integration planning is going very well. We are working very closely on everything that we can at this point in the process to prepare for the future. And I realize that the timing on this is unfortunate, but we are continuing to move forward and look forward to integrating the two companies and being really the premier oil and gas company prepared for the energy transition. Thanks, Doug. Operator : And our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask around the Canada sales. So if I go back to the Hess deal, you know, the rationale was to buy, you know, long cycle high-quality resource and obviously diversify your portfolio. And Guyana is very different from Canada, obviously, but could you just talk about the decision to execute that divestment now ahead of the arbitration decision? Which was a surprise, but also more broadly, you know, I would have thought you were a net buyer of long cycle resource. So if you could just talk about how you are thinking about that and how you are thinking about the portfolio, that would be helpful. Michael Wirth : Sure. So, Biraj, we have got a long history in Canada. AOSP has been, you know, a steady contributor of cash for many years. But, you know, we have also indicated that as a 20% non-op position, it was not really viewed as a core asset in the portfolio. So as we were marketing the unconventional position in the Kaybob Duvernay, we were not actually marketing AOSP, but the buyer came to us and proposed buying both. And made us a very attractive offer to buy both. You know, the Duvernay, while it is a good asset, we are struggling to compete against the strength in other parts of our shale and tight portfolio. And AOSP, you know, as we have indicated for some time, is a non-core asset we were willing to consider offers for it, but there was a long time when I think potential buyers were struggling to give us the value that we saw, to your point, for a long-duration asset. The Canadian producers are faring better today. I think their valuations have recovered, and so we were presented with an opportunity to transact at what we thought was good value and we have been patient. Others have left the oil sands over the years at what we felt were discounted values, and we were not prepared to do that. But when we got a value that we thought was a fair value, you know, we were prepared to transact. And, you know, yes, we want to add good quality long-duration assets to the portfolio, but we have a lot of those in our portfolio today. And so I do not think you should read our desire for those kinds of assets to say that anything that would kind of broadly fit under that heading is not eligible for potential divestment. We are going to continue to high-grade our portfolio over time and as we add quality assets and use technology to improve the value of assets in our portfolio, we will always ask ourselves if the balance of the portfolio has more value to others than it does to us and be willing to entertain that kind of a question. Thanks, Biraj. Operator : And the next question will come from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein : Thanks, guys. Just on the $2 billion to $3 billion cost savings, how much of this comes from the announced $8 billion of asset sales year to date versus what maybe comes from additional asset sales and structural savings, and then any split between upstream or downstream? Eimear Bonner : Yeah. Thanks, Josh. So let me talk you through kind of our plan here given that it is new material. So first of all, as you saw on the slide, we have been disciplined in managing our costs competitively over the years. So this program is essentially our next set of cost reduction steps to sustain our discipline given that in our business, costs always matter. They are always important. So what we are focused on here is reducing absolute costs while we deliver significant growth in the business. Think about this program as focused on the controllables. We are expecting run rate reductions to be realized over the next few years by the end of 2026 from a 2024 baseline. So the full benefits will be seen in 2027. So in terms of where the reductions are coming from, the first category is really portfolio actions. So examples like what we have heard today in the call and the United Canada, Alaska, Congo, sales. So there is a large portion of this associated with that. We see the direct cost be reduced as the asset transfer from our portfolio. And then we would expect overhead costs associated with those assets to reduce over time. So that is one part of this program. The second part is just improvement initiatives that we see across the organization. They are coming from the business units, all segments. They are coming from the functions. You know, some examples of what we are talking about here are initiatives that leverage technology solutions to reduce cost, drones, robotics, digital twins that have transformed how we think about operating and maintaining our facilities. That would be an example. Another example would be improvement initiatives that really look to how we do our work, where we do our work, an example there would be the recent announcement of the engine global capability center in India. So in these centers, we are looking to standardize and centralize more of our workflow. So that is really what the program is. You know, when you think about the range, you know, what I would say is the first $2 billion, think about these as divestments and cost reduction initiatives that are in our plan, they are either execution ready or working towards becoming execution ready. Think about the third billion as an additional target that we have with initiatives that are underway that we have not really quantified. They are not execution ready. We have work to do to make them execution ready. So that is how I would describe the range and, you know, we expect to provide updates on these initiatives. We will do that through 2025 as we execute on them and deliver results. Thanks. Operator : And we will go to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet and shareholder returns. Your net debt ticked up a bit quarter over quarter in 3Q versus 2Q, I think supporting strong buybacks, and you are still well below your long-term targets. You have cash coming in the door from asset sale proceeds, as you noted, between now and year-end, and then a nice inflection in the Permian and TCO cash flow into next year. But I guess my question is given how volatile commodity markets and oil markets specifically have been in recent times, how do you think about continuing to use the balance sheet to support shareholder returns versus tapering it back and waiting for potentially lower commodity prices over the next few years? So balance sheet use and how you think about that is the core of the question. Michael Wirth : Yeah. Devin, let me just address share repurchases, then I will let Eimear talk about the balance sheet. Recent volatility in commodity prices, for somebody who has been in this industry for 42 years, is not new news. That is the way this industry works, and we are in a volatile cyclical commodity business. So, you know, the backdrop is nothing we are not well prepared for. First thing is I just want to reiterate our guidance, you know, the share repurchase run rate of $17.5 billion is unchanged. The range we have given you, you know, kind of brackets the way we execute the program, and we were, you know, a little bit above the, you know, the midpoint of that here this most recent quarter. We have got a strong track record of buying back shares, which is our fourth financial priority, and that is after, you know, making sure we can sustain and increase the dividend where we have got a track record of doing that for 37 years in a row. Reinvesting in organic projects to grow future cash flows, to support that. So the second priority, the third is to maintain a strong balance sheet. We have got a AA credit and below 12% net debt. And then the fourth is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases, which we have done for 17 of the last 21 years. And so consistency in financial priorities, consistency is very important. And I think we have got a track record that we can stand behind there through commodity price cycles. You know, over the last 21 years where it says 17 of 21 that we have repurchased. We have seen a financial crisis. We have seen a pandemic. We have seen OPEC, you know, open up the taps and, you know, commodity prices respond accordingly. And so we have been through down cycles. We have been through unexpected circumstances and have maintained a strong track record of shareholder distributions through it. In part because we have maintained a conservative financial position and a very strong balance sheet. I will let Eimear talk a little more about the balance sheet. Eimear Bonner : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Devin, you know, when we look at the balance sheet, you know, we are focused on maintaining its strength through the cycles. Right? It is an asset that we use to create value and to navigate the volatility that Mike talked about and reward shareholders consistently. So when we look at our debt levels today, our net debt is under 12%. That is at the low end of where we have been over the last ten plus years. So we are under-levered and given this and all the growth that is coming and the additional asset sale proceeds that we are expecting in the short term, we are comfortable with where we are, and, you know, we anticipate the net debt will come down a little bit in the near term with the asset sale proceeds that are coming. But we are planning with a multi-year time horizon with a through-cycle approach, and we are very comfortable with where we are right now with the balance sheet. Thanks. Operator : And moving on to Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. Lloyd Byrne : Hey. Good morning. First, congrats to you and your M&A team. I think the divestiture progress has been great. I want to follow up quickly to Biraj's question. AOSP seemed very opportunistic. Does that change your long-term goals? And then really, I wanted to ask about the DJ and see whether, I mean, it is just really impressive operating progress there. Synergies, free cash flow, but I think the surprise has to be you guys holding it flat to the end of the decade. Maybe you can just comment on the opportunities there and whether there are more opportunities for scale. Michael Wirth : Thanks. Yeah. So just to quickly touch on AOSP, you know, there was one kind of most logical buyer. Right? And it was the operator, and we have had discussions over the years and have not been able to really get to a common view on value. And so that is what has changed. And so if you want to see that as opportunistic, that is fine. But we really wanted to realize the value that we saw in that asset, and we have been able to do that. The DJ, look, you know, the first thing I will say is the integration there and the synergy delivery continues to track record that we have had over a long time of exceeding our synergy commitments. And, you know, when we do a deal and we come out with a target, it is intended to give you a high confidence number that you can use, and we have done the diligence we have at that point in, you know, our track record as we find more and we deliver more. We are very happy with the quality of the asset and the ability to drive strong performance. We have learned from each of the companies that we have acquired. I talked a little bit about the lower carbon footprint there. We have seen some other things like gas lift and new laterals that have been used. Some of these companies that we are starting to work with in some of our other parts of our portfolio. And the last thing I will say is the team there does a wonderful job of balancing the multi-step permitting process, and I know there has been some concern expressed by people about the regulatory environments. You know, we are working very closely with the regulator in Colorado to ensure that we can achieve their objectives and that we can achieve our objectives. And I would say that is a very constructive relationship. We have got comprehensive area plans in place that derisk the longer-term development. And the quality of the assets, you know, 400,000 barrels a day out through the end of the decade. You know, three years ago, we had zero in the DJ Basin. And so very pleased with it. We are big there. We are the biggest operator there. The question was, are you going to acquire some additional positions there? I would not say that is high on the priority list. The real key is to drive value out of this asset. Operator : And the next question will come from Betty Jing with Barclays. Betty Jing : I was on mute. I am sorry. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to ask about the Gulf of Mexico. It feels like there is a bit of a technology renaissance that is happening in the Gulf, including the Anchor project that just came online. Can you talk about how the technology is opening up new resource opportunities for the Gulf for the Chevron portfolio, and does that represent any upside to how you think about the longer-term production and resource opportunities in that area? Michael Wirth : Yeah. Betty, it sure does. And it is an extension of the story of the Gulf of Mexico. You know, initially, on the shelf as people moved from onshore to offshore, then out into the deep water, and we began to develop techniques to explore and ultimately develop and produce in deepwater now in the ultra-deepwater and in the ultra-deepwater now at ultra-high pressures and temperatures. And, you know, the breakthroughs on the Anchor project, and it is the first one to be producing with 20,000 psi technology. I mentioned last week in something I was doing just to help people understand that. That is essentially the pressure that would exist if an elephant, a full-grown male African elephant, were standing on a quarter. And so it is incredibly high pressure. These are high-temperature fields that everything that goes along with that needs to be capable of dealing with those pressures that include, you know, trees, blowout preventers, etcetera. We have a three million ton hook load now on the drill ships, which is the highest hook load we have ever seen. That opens up a lot. At least, you know, 20% of our exploration portfolio is going to require this kind of capability. We are using other things like ocean bottom node seismic now, that helps us better characterize developments and exploration opportunities. Think of it as 4D, essentially. Technology out there. We are working on AI tools to help guide exploration focus areas and predict geologic risk factors more effectively. So, yeah, I think the history of the Gulf of Mexico has been technology advancements to continue to allow us to identify and then produce resources out there. It is a vast area. The Mississippi River is, you know, was and is an incredible conveyor belt for organic material out into the Gulf of Mexico, and the industry is not done there by any means. I think there is a lot left to go. And maybe the last thing I will say about it is, you know, this is about unlocking new opportunities. We are also working hard to make better use of existing infrastructure with nearer field development, the ability to tie back at longer distances and develop smaller discoveries that would not support standalone greenfield developments but can very easily tie back as a brownfield to an existing facility. Vallemore is a good example of this, and I think you are going to see more of those as well. So the heyday of the Gulf of Mexico is far from over. Operator : And the next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi. Good morning. You have an excellent production record in both Tengiz and Gorgon that they have done well. And it is particularly impressive that, given both of them, you have turned around. It looks like the turnaround has done well and maybe that came in faster than the scheduled time? So is it a one-off, or have you changed the process so that this is a repeatable benefit that we could expect in the future? Michael Wirth : Well, it is the latter. And we have been working on this both upstream and downstream because these facilities are starting to look a lot more similar than they are different. And to deliver higher returns, one of the keys is to execute turnarounds well, ensure the work that is done enables reliable operations in between turnarounds, and to continually improve on this. I mentioned earlier that Eimear was just out in Kazakhstan and has been into Gorgon not too much earlier. Eimear, maybe you can talk a little bit more specifically about what you are seeing on turnaround execution. Eimear Bonner : Yeah. No problem. And thanks, Paul, for the question. Yeah. To Mike's point, I mean, our complex facilities, whether they are in refining or upstream assets like TCO and Gorgon, they are more similar than different. And so this has been an area of focus for us to try and standardize how we approach these complex turnarounds to really drive performance. So we have been working on it diligently for a few years. And I think that the improvement actions that I would point to would include maybe the first one is just how we think about the scope of the turnaround. And think about this as looking at all the units and equipment and discerning, can I do the maintenance work on the run, or do I need to do the maintenance work only when the plant is shut down? And so there is a lot of improvement being delivered because we have been very diligent about discerning what is in and what is out. We call that rigorous scope management. And the second improvement talks to the digital tools that we have used to really help with not only planning but execution and prioritization. I will give you a couple of examples of the digital tools. Digital tools that help us with permits, digital tools that help us with isolation, digital tools that help us with leak testing and flange management, in addition to digital tools that help us with managing the span and control given that these turnarounds bring in huge numbers of personnel at once. That is another area. The third one, which I believe we have taken to a whole different level, is benchmarking. And we benchmark turnarounds. We benchmark the units. But the benchmarking that we are doing today, the benchmarking goes down to the equipment level. And so just the rigor in the benchmarking to look for improvements and to learn where we can be more efficient is yielding positive results. Then finally, I would say, we have experts in this area from an organizational capability perspective. We have employees that have spent most of their careers in turnarounds. And so we have looked for opportunities to share resources and to cross-pollinate with these experts so that the lessons that we learn in TCO, we can learn them in Gorgon and vice versa. The lessons that we are learning in refining, we can implement those lessons learned in the upstream. So all of those things coming together have really driven a step change in our performance with nearly nine turnarounds executed this year. Almost all of them have been delivered at industry-level performance. So we are very pleased with this work given the criticality of it to base business excellence, and these results are industry-leading. Michael Wirth : Yeah. Paul, eight out of the nine turnarounds were executed in line with first-quarter duration targets. The Gorgon train two turnaround was our best Gorgon turnaround ever, with a 14% improvement in duration. The TCO KTL one turnaround was a 23% improvement in duration compared to the last one. And in several of our refinery turnarounds, we saw cost decreases of up to 50% compared to the prior turnaround of that same unit. So I think there is some real quantifiable progress that you can see across the system that is being achieved. Thanks, Paul. Operator : And the next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning. If I return to the structural cost reductions, and I want to put it in the context of the relocation from California to Texas. Is that relocation an opportunity for the cost reductions? I believe that redesign processes and organizations, or is it a threat to the cost reductions where there is chaos and lack of continuity? How do you think about it? Michael Wirth : I do not think it is a threat, Bob. We have talked about the relocation occurring over a period of time. We are going to be very thoughtful about moving work from one location to another, moving people from one location to another. Not all of the work being done in San Ramon necessarily will go to Houston. So it may go to these global capability centers that Eimear talked about earlier. Some of it we may find technology tools that help us to do the work more efficiently and automate things. And so I think it is a little bit of a simplistic reduction to think about just lifting and shifting everything from San Ramon to Houston. It is a migration of work to different technology platforms, different locations, and we will do that thoughtfully and methodically over a period of time. We will make sure it is been planned out and derisked. And so, you know, I think it is part of an ongoing work evolution in a global company that has a workforce around the world, that can do work in many different places, that historically did a lot of work in business units because that is the way it had to be done. But now there are other ways to approach this work, and we are looking for ways to do it best to deliver the best work product and do that at a cost structure that is ever improving. Thanks for the question. Operator : And moving on to Lucas Hermann with BNP Paribas. Lucas Hermann : Yeah. Thanks very much. And afternoon, Mike and Eimear. A fairly obvious question, I guess. I just wanted to talk to you. I wondered if both of you could talk a little bit more about CapEx going forward, and maybe it is an inappropriate time, and December will be better. But if I look at what is happening with the business, you know, obviously, Tengiz starts up. You have got your assets in the Gulf coming on, you are talking about, you know, driving for free cash or driving for NPV value in the Permian CapEx coming down there. If I think about the current rate of CapEx spend including, you know, associates, it feels as though it is around $18, $18.5 billion if you got at the beginning of the year. If I look at the opportunities for that CapEx to start to fall as projects or as plateau or projects come on, it feels as though, you know, maybe $3, $4 billion of CapEx opportunity sits there or opportunities to support CapEx decline. Yes. It is there. What is really hard, Mike, is to see, you know, where that goes. Particularly given, obviously, everything going on in the Eastern Meds at the moment. So, you know, is it right now to start thinking about CapEx coming down very materially as we move forward over the next two, three years, and you are really starting to benefit more emphatically from a portfolio that, in essence, is, you know, deep in resource but pretty long duration. Michael Wirth : Yeah. So you have covered a lot of waterfront there, Lucas. Let me try to address some of it, then let Eimear share some of her thoughts. Number one, I think an important point is if you look at the rateability of our CapEx, we used to have a program that had a lot of big long-duration capital projects. There was a pattern where the back half of the year, fourth quarter in particular, tended to be a little bit heavier at first. Quarter a little bit lighter. We are very ratable now. We have been about $4 billion on our organic CapEx, you know, all three quarters this year. So it has become much more ratable and predictable. That is a reflection of the nature of the projects that we are doing. Point two, you talked about CapEx coming down. A decade ago, our CapEx was $40 billion. Today, you bring in affiliates, as you say, it is $18 something, $18.5 or whatever that number is. So it is less than half of where we were. So it has come down substantially even as production has grown, as the company generates more cash. We are doing it in a much more capital-efficient manner than we ever have before. And then point three is, yes, we will continue to seek further ways to optimize and improve the capital efficiency of our company. A larger portfolio does over time require capital to maintain it, and so, there lies the trade-offs that you evaluate as you look at your capital investment opportunities, the readiness of those, to move into execution. And I think in the near term, what is very clear is our affiliate CapEx will come down next year as the project in Kazakhstan concludes. So you will see affiliate CapEx come off. You know, we are in the process right now of finalizing our business plan for 2025. And so it is a bit premature for me to guide you to that number, but we are looking at all the trade-offs and then we will know more about that after we complete our planning process. But our intent is to stay very disciplined, which I think is something we have demonstrated here over, you know, many, many years now. Our guidance range of $14 to $16 billion is unchanged. And I think you should expect us to respect that. And if that does change, by some quantum and you throw out some larger numbers there, you know, we will cover that with everybody and talk about how it has changed, why it has changed, and how you should think about what that means going forward. Do you want to add anything to that? Eimear Bonner : I think you have covered most of it, Mike, given that we are putting our plan together right now. Lucas, all I would say is, you know, the projects that you referenced and how we see the CapEx profiles coming off and the free cash flow growing as those projects complete. It is a key focus for us. So we will give you more information on our fourth-quarter call as we complete the process. We do not want to get ahead of the process right now. Thanks for the question. Operator : And the next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So could you talk about your position in California in the downstream, still having two refineries there, and we have had another closure announced over the past couple of weeks. Is shutting capacity something you have considered in California, and how do you think the market will be impacted by this latest closure? Do you think we will see structurally higher profitability there as a result, or maybe things will adapt kind of back to where they were? Michael Wirth : Yeah. John, first of all, I think what I would say is we have seen another ill-conceived move by a state that has implemented policies to deliver its residents the highest gasoline price in the country. This most recent action to insert state bureaucracy into turnaround planning and inventory management is likely to make prices go higher, not lower. Putting bureaucrats in charge of centrally planning key segments of the economy has not worked in other socialist states, and I doubt it will be any different in California. Policies that constrain supply faster than demand is adjusting create more volatility, and they tend to create a greater likelihood of higher prices. And so unfortunately, these measures are advertised as doing the opposite, but the reality is for anybody that looks at them and thinks them through, discouraging investment and constraining supply when you still have strong demand is going to lead to just one conclusion. And so, look, we have operated in California for over a century. Both of our refineries are over a hundred years old. We have got very competitive refineries, and we have got strong integrated value chains with very strong brands, strong customer relationships, and so these are competitive businesses that we will continue to evaluate within our portfolio like every other asset as we have discussed earlier. And so we will continue to meet our customer needs and compete. We will evaluate alternatives if and when it becomes evident that that is the appropriate thing to do. But I will tell you, it is very tough to justify any new investments in that system, and it is only getting tougher. Thanks for the question. Operator : And we will take a question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I would like to ask you, Mike, about the LNG markets globally. You know, we have seen some new units get delayed. We have seen a couple of other companies this earnings season talk about, you know, the outlook in terms of supply-demand balance kind of favoring tightness in 2025. Just curious how you look at it and maybe if you could remind us of your, you know, contract versus spot exposure so we could think about how that might play, you know, the margin potential for Chevron in 2025. Michael Wirth : Yeah. So, you know, LNG demand continues to grow. But it comes against the backdrop of very healthy inventories. You know, you ask about 2025, inventories in Europe are strong for this time of year. Inventories in the US are very healthy for this time of the year. You see that reflected in Henry Hub prices. And so overall, we have got, you know, a market that currently has healthy inventories and recently good supply becomes somewhat weather-dependent. And so, you know, that can change with a very cold winter. But right now, I would say, you know, it does not look like 2025 is setting up to be a particularly tight market, you know, and then longer term, of course, we have supply coming on in Qatar. We have got supply coming on in the US. And so there is more supply coming to that market. And so I think in the, you know, the short to medium term, it is a market that is not really prone to becoming nearly as tight as what we saw a couple of years ago when the situation in Ukraine began. Our particular portfolio is 80 plus percent contracted primarily on oil index pricing on long-term contracts. Most of our sales are into North Asia. And 20% or less spot exposure, and a lot of that is out of our West Africa position, and we will have some spot cargoes from other parts of the system occasionally. But primarily long-term contracts, primarily tied to crude price. Thanks, Roger. Operator : And moving on to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Nitin Kumar : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just maybe touch a little bit on the chemicals business. It seemed like it was a bit of a tailwind to earnings this quarter. What are you seeing from your supply chain, particularly in Asia, you know, you have heard about some stimulus to be offered there, but just looking at what the earnings look like for the chems business. Michael Wirth : Yeah. You know, we are actually seeing polyethylene chain margins have strengthened over the course of this year. So it has been an improving market backdrop. Some of that I think has been some short-term supply disruptions in certain areas. These are long-cycle commodity markets that demand grows kind of steadily, but slowly supply comes on in big chunks. And so we have had a market that has been a little bit oversupplied, and that has put pressure on the olefin chains, particularly in Asia. And so, you know, I think over time, we expect to see margins improve. We have got a couple of projects that will come online in the second half of this decade. And you cannot time these things perfectly, but I think they are likely to come on after the trough and into what is in olefin chain markets. One of those projects is in the US, one in the Middle East. Asia is the big market, obviously. Naphtha and naphtha cracking being the alternative, you know, you do have some interrelation on margins with crude oil prices and if at the margin, Asia and AP crackers are what an ethane cracker in the Middle East or the US is competing with. You have got some interplay between those two. And so we will watch it over time. CP Chem is a well-run business, GS Caltex in Korea is a well-run business, and we have seen these kinds of cycles before. We remain very, you know, constructive on this sector over time as we think the fundamentals will be very good in CP Chem and a lot of ethane-based feedstock, which makes it very competitive. Thanks, Nitin. Operator : And moving on to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe just hi. Good morning. Maybe one on the Eastern Mediterranean. Could you maybe just provide a status update in terms of kind of current operation, the Tamar expansion efforts, the next leg of potential expansion of commercial development there, and what impact I guess, what is and is not happening or moving forward given the current uncertainties in the region right now? Michael Wirth : Sure. So, obviously, you know, the priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and the integrity of the assets. We have seen the demobilization of the pipeline vessel that was working on, you know, the current expansion projects at both Tamar and Leviathan as, you know, the contractor concluded that, you know, the current risk environment was one that, you know, they were not comfortable with. We see both of those projects still being completed late next year. We will keep you advised, you know, obviously, this will depend on when that is remobilized. But we have got projects underway in the short term at both Leviathan to increase production, you know, by about 200 million cubic feet a day to 1.4 BCF. And Tamar is about half a billion cubic feet per day from 1.1 to 1.6. So those are on track for late next year. We have entered feed for a larger expansion at Leviathan that would take us up, you know, significantly more. There is some room on the platform to add more processing capacity. That is a project that would be completed towards the end of this decade. And we are in feed on that now. So more to follow. I think in the short term, obviously, you know, we are going to make sure people are safe. We have had to actually take production at Leviathan down a couple of times because of some of the risks in the region. But we are meeting all of our supply commitments both in the country and to regional customers. And I have been able to do that despite, you know, the conflict that is underway. Operator : And our last question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Hi, Mike. You talked earlier about the operated Permian position. I just wanted to get a sense of what you are seeing in the non-op and royalty piece. You know, are we seeing a two-speed operating system in the basin with respect to what various operators are doing? Thank you. Michael Wirth : Yeah. You know, we have seen strength across all three of the components of our business. Our club growth this year, as I said, is probably going to be a little bit higher than the 15% we have seen the last three years. Royalty may be a little lower than that. I know a little bit higher. I do not know. I think you said that we see a two-speed development approach. I would not say that. I would say we are all kind of in the same fairway. Certainly, some of our NOJBN royalty is in highly attractive sweet spots. And I think the economics on that are very good for our partners or our operators where we hold the royalty interest. And I would not say there is significant enough variation between our program and what we see with others to describe it as a two-speed program if that was the question. Thanks very much, Alastair. Jake Spiering : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Justin, back to you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Chevron's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Head of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering : Thank you, Katie, and welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call and webcast. I\u2019m Jake Spiering, Head of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Eimear Bonner, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement and additional information presented on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Jake, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Chevron delivered another year of strong results in 2024. We achieved record production both globally and in the United States and reached key milestones that are expected to underpin years of future cash flow. This includes outstanding performance in the Permian, exceeding expectations with production growth of nearly 18% from last year; Delivering key project start-ups in the Gulf of America; Fully integrating PDC Energy, expanding our position in the DJ Basin; Optimizing our portfolio through asset sales and swaps that maximize long-term value; and completing WPMP and achieving first oil at the future growth project at TCO last week. We also returned a record $27 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve repurchased $30 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 10%. We continued to build our new energies business and complete projects to lower the carbon intensity of our operations. In 2024, we sold over 20 million barrels of bio-based diesel and advanced foundational projects in CCUS and hydrogen. We also completed projects designed to abate over 700 thousand tons of CO2 emissions annually. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eimear to go over the financials. Eimear Bonner : Thanks, Mike. Chevron reported fourth quarter earnings of $3.2 billion, or $1.84 per share. Adjusted earnings were $3.6 billion, or $2.06 per share. Included in the quarter were special items totaling $1.1 billion related to restructuring and impairment charges. Foreign currency gains were $720 million. Full-year organic CapEx was aligned with our announced $16 billion budget. Inorganic CapEx of $530 million related mostly to lease acquisitions and new energies investments. We maintained double digit returns with adjusted ROCE of 10.5% for the year. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were $900 million lower. Adjusted upstream earnings were impacted by revisions to asset retirement obligations and timing effects, including year-end inventory valuation. Adjusted Downstream earnings were lower due to softer refining and chemicals margins and timing effects. Chevron\u2019s cash generation continued to position the company for long-term success while rewarding shareholders. In 2024, we Invested capital efficiently, growing production by 7%; Generated nearly $8 billion in proceeds from asset sales; sustained our long track record of dividend increases and repurchased 5% of shares outstanding; and maintained a strong balance sheet, ending the year with a net debt ratio of 10%. Chevron\u2019s long-standing financial priorities have created value for shareholders. They have guided our actions through multiple commodity and investment cycles and will continue to govern how we allocate capital. Over the past five years we have grown our dividend faster than the S&P 500 and nearly double the rate of our closest peer. Today, we announced a 5% increase in the dividend, marking the 38th consecutive year with an annual increase to dividend payment per share. We\u2019re committed to capital discipline. Only the most competitive projects in our portfolio will get funded. Where assets don\u2019t compete for capital, we have a history of generating value commercially. The balance sheet is in excellent health, with net debt below our historical levels. We\u2019ve repurchased shares 17 of the last 21 years and intend to maintain a buyback range of $10 to $20 billion per year depending on market conditions. Compared to our peers, we\u2019re delivering growth with less capital and returning more cash to shareholders. In the past three years, we\u2019ve returned $75 billion in cash to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. Now, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike to cover our near-term outlook. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Eimear. Chevron is in a strong position today, with near-term catalysts that are expected to drive the company to even better performance in 2025 and 2026. Our objective is unchanged, to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. In the next two years, we plan to achieve industry leading free cash flow growth; further strengthen our portfolio, including the expected completion of the Hess transaction in the third quarter; advance opportunities in renewable fuels, hydrogen, CCUS and power; while maintaining cost and capital discipline. It's important to note that the guidance provided today exclude tests, we continue to be very confident in assets position in arbitration. We plan to host our next Investor day with the longer term outlook after we close the transaction later this year. Chevron is poised for industry-leading free cash flow growth. We expect to add $10 billion of annual free cash flow in 2026, led by growth and advantaged upstream assets. With additional production from FGP and a further reduction in affiliate CapEx, we expect a sustained increase in distributions from TCO going forward. In the Gulf of America, where we produce some of the highest margin barrels in our portfolio, we'll have additional growth as Anchor and Whale continue to ramp up and we bring Balimore online. And in the Permian, we're focused on operational efficiency and free cash flow, positioning the asset as a core cash generator for the company. We're also executing plans to deliver stronger results across the entire portfolio, including cash savings from our targeted $2 billion to $3 billion reduction in structural costs and improved returns in our Downstream and Chemicals businesses. At TCO, we achieved first oil at FGP last week. This important milestone is the result of consistent, disciplined execution by the project and operations teams. Our focus remains on a safe and reliable ramp-up of the plant. FGP adds 260,000 barrels of oil production capacity to the existing plants. We expect to achieve full production rates 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day \u2013 within the next three months. At $70 Brent, expected free cash flow to Chevron is $5 billion in 2025 and $6 billion in 2026. This includes fixed loan repayments and quarterly dividends. We are proud to bring this large, complex project online for the benefit of our shareholders and the Republic of Kazakhstan and look forward to future collaboration to maximize the long-term value of the Tengiz reservoir. In 2024, execution efficiencies led to strong well and base business performance, helping us achieve another record for Permian production. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve delivered compound annual growth of 16% while continuing to capture efficiencies. Through optimized pad and drilling designs, and completions improvements like triple frac, we\u2019re able to achieve these production levels with 40% fewer company-operated rigs than our plans included just a few years ago. We expect production to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025, and plan to moderate growth and CapEx to drive predictable and durable free cash flow generation. Our Permian portfolio delivers superior returns due to royalty advantaged acreage across all of the sub-basins, which add to both the top and bottom-line. We\u2019re continuing to develop and deploy technologies to enhance efficiencies and recoveries. We\u2019re leveraging our strengths in advanced chemicals and stimulation and scaling them across our shale and tight portfolio. Our world-class upstream assets provide further growth opportunities that are poised to deliver value for decades. In the Gulf of America, where we expect to grow production to 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, we achieved first oil at the Anchor and Whale projects, and Ballymore is expected to come online around the middle of this year. In Western Australia, our discovered resource has the ability to keep our LNG plants full for decades. Last month, we announced an asset swap that will increase our equity in Wheatstone, which enables long-term asset development and monetization. In West Africa, we have a queue of low-cost developments that are expected to sustain production for many years. We recently extended leases in Nigeria and had a shelf discovery that will tie back to existing infrastructure. In Angola, we achieved first gas at the Sanha Lean Gas Connection project, and we plan to bring online our South N\u2019dola development later this year. In the Eastern Mediterranean, we have a significant resource position we\u2019re continuing to unlock. Expansion projects at Leviathan and Tamar are expected to come online through the end of the decade. Turning to our Downstream and Chemicals businesses, we\u2019re focused on operating reliably and efficiently while executing competitive projects that extend our value chains and capture market synergies. The recently completed expansion at our Pasadena refinery enhances our integrated value chain by running more Permian crude, supplying more products to our regional marketing business and expanding synergies with the Pascagoula refinery. Our petrochemical growth projects in the U.S. and Qatar are more than 50% complete and are expected to contribute to further cash flow growth beyond 2026. Both projects are feedstock advantaged, have competitive cost structures and are well-positioned to serve growing demand. We have several projects in our New Energies business that are expected to achieve key milestones in the next two years. In renewable fuels, we\u2019re in final commissioning of the Geismar renewable diesel expansion and at our Bunge joint venture, construction continues at the new oilseed processing plant in Louisiana, increasing our exposure across the renewable fuels value chain. We\u2019re working towards start-up of the ACES green hydrogen project in Utah later this year, which will produce hydrogen from water and excess renewable power and store it underground for dispatchable lower carbon power generation. The project is one of the world\u2019s largest hydrogen storage projects and will have over 200 megawatts of electrolyzer capacity. In carbon capture and storage, Bayou Bend is working towards a FEED decision for the offshore project, and we\u2019re also developing plans to capture and store CO2 from our Pascagoula refinery. Earlier this week we announced plans to jointly develop scalable, reliable power solutions to support growing energy demand from U.S. data centers. Chevron is positioned to participate in this growth and generate competitive returns through integration with our U.S. natural gas business; Experience in building and operating nearly five gigawatts of reliable, behind-themeter power; and Expertise in technologies that can help provide a pathway to reduce GHG emissions. We've secured slot reservations to purchase seven natural gas fired turbines from GE Vernova with deliveries beginning late 2026, and we\u2019re advancing site selection and engineering work while engaging customers. We look forward to sharing more as our plans develop. I\u2019ll hand it back to Eimear to close out our guidance for 2025 and 2026. Eimear Bonner : Thanks, Mike. In a cyclical commodity business, capital and cost discipline always matter. Chevron\u2019s CapEx and affiliate capex budgets reflect our commitment to capital efficiency while funding a balanced portfolio of short and long-cycle investments. Organic CapEx is expected to remain within our $14-16 billion guidance range. As spend in the Permian and Gulf of America comes down, capital will flow elsewhere within the portfolio to support continued growth. Affiliate c is expected to trend down further as investments at TCO and CPChem come online. We\u2019re targeting $2 billion to $3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. Work is underway to deliver these savings through asset sales; scaling technology solutions, such as expanding the use of robotics; and changing how we work to improve efficiencies. We\u2019re executing our plans to lower absolute costs while delivering growth. Last year, worldwide oil equivalent production was the highest in our history, benefitting from a larger position in the DJ Basin following our acquisition of PDC Energy and nearly 18% growth in the Permian. Excluding asset sales, we expect production to grow around 6% annually through 2026. In 2025, we expect growth to be weighted towards the second half of the year as key projects in Tengiz and the Gulf of America come online and ramp throughout the year. We\u2019re excited about the year ahead. We\u2019re focused on delivering growth across advantaged assets and value chains while reducing absolute costs; starting up profitable New Energies projects and advancing new behind-the-meter power solutions; and continuing to reward our shareholders with higher returns and a differentiated value proposition. I\u2019ll now hand it off to Jake. Jake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. Additional guidance can be found in the appendix to this presentation and the slides and other information posted on chevron.com. We're now ready to take your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Firstly, congrats on getting FGP online. I know it\u2019s a big project. So I wanted to ask about sort of underlying cash flow, excluding working capital. This quarter, at least versus our model the $5.3 billion was quite a bit with what we expected. So could you just walk me through how I should think about any one-offs in there? And help me understand what the sort of underlying basis should be as we think about \u201825? Thank you. Eimear Bonner : Hi, Biraj, thanks for the question. You're right. Cash flow, excluding working capital, was impacted by some non-recurring and accounting items this past quarter. So let me step you through the big ones. Maybe the first is we recognized some tax charges and earnings related to our recently completed Canadian asset sale, and that was around $1.5 billion. It's important to note that these tax charges are offset in working capital. But if you exclude the working capital when you're looking at cash flow, you're still going to see that tax charge. So that's a big one. That's the main one. The second one is we also recorded some charges in the quarter that for earnings, we had identified those as special items. We disclosed them back in December and our capital release. However, we don't make the same adjustments for these items and cash flow. So you're seeing some of that flow through to the bottom line, and that's about a $500 million headwind. Beyond those two items, we did have some other impacts, the combination of affiliate distributions, some unique commercial activity, and that's another $500 million. So when you add up the three elements, that's about $2.5 billion to take into consideration for the cash flow this quarter. So if you've got any additional questions on those pieces acknowledging they're a bit unusual this quarter. I mean Jake can follow up with you after the call and sure you how everything flows through. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. When we're looking at your next two years, I think we have a really good outlay and I think investors are comfortable. I think the question has always been talking about longer term, say, by the turn of the decade, I mean what you're going to do if we put half of that aside. And in here, can you talk about your opportunity set you already had the [indiscernible], for example, I believe there's a lot of discovery you guys have made in Nigeria and Angola. But where are we in terms of bringing those that to the solution and having the project coming on stream? What we need in order for that to become a win out there [ph] and how big are those opportunities there? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Okay. Paul, thank you. Yeah, you're right. What we laid out today is a more detailed look ahead for the next two years. And as you rightly note, there's a lot of significant growth. We wanted to provide you more confidence and visibility on that free cash flow growth. And frankly, it continues to be derisked every day here during the month of January with the whale startup and the FGP start-up, are two significant events that really derisk that. And so that was the primary objective is provide transparency and confidence in that. And I will set Hess aside, but I'll just acknowledge that we look forward to closing Hess, which will make a strong hand even stronger. If you look out beyond the end of 2026, there are a number of things that are going to contribute to continued free cash flow growth. We've got two big chemicals projects that are under construction that will come online late '26, early '27 time window. We've got projects in the Eastern Mediterranean in the near term for both Tamar and Leviathan that will come on towards the end of this year and be ramping into '26 and beyond. And then we've got further work underway, particularly at Leviathan for yet another expansion in the Eastern Mediterranean. I would expect Argentina over the back half of this decade to begin to grow at a rate that's stronger than what we've seen thus far. Contingent upon -- continued progress in policy and kind of government stability and macro environment stability there, but the signs there have been encouraging and positive. You mentioned West Africa. There's a number of opportunities. I talked about a discovery on the Nigeria shelf, Saudi Arabian gas, South Angola, We have a number of other very attractive prospects there. We haven't really gone below 10,000 feet to produce yet in that region. We picked up additional acreage offshore Angola, three new blocks that are undergoing seismic work right now. And we haven't talked a lot about West Africa in recent years given some of the other things within our portfolio, but that has a lot of running room left ahead of us. Venezuelan Partition Zone, huge, huge resource positions. We've been moving thoughtfully for particular reasons in each of those locations, but those present long-term opportunities that are captured and can become very attractive. And we've got a really nice exploration portfolio. In West Africa, South America, the U.S. Gulf, the Eastern Mediterranean that we expect to provide further resource opportunities. We've got technology that can unlock things. And of course, a large low decline base that we can sustain with a very competitive capital investment and good underlying growth rates. So we've seen outsized growth here in recent times, right. Last year's growth 7%. We're guiding to a 6% CAGR on for the next couple of years. That's probably not a growth rate that anyone would expect to continue. But there are plenty of opportunities out there in the 2027 and beyond Q we'll sort through and fund the best of those within a tight disciplined capital budget. Thanks, Paul. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yeah, good morning, Mike and team. Just wanted to better understand the power business and the announcement from earlier this week with GE Vernova. Mike, you've talked a lot about power being a tricky business, and Chevron seen that firsthand over the last 30 years at different points. But and wanting to ensure that you're staying true to your core competency. So how do you think about playing in this ecosystem and ensuring that you derisk it so that you can preserve the upside? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So Neil, I would tell you, you should think of this as being aligned with what we've said we were looking to do, which is leverage our strengths to advance lower carbon energy solutions to meet demand growth in the world. We operate nearly 5 gigawatts of reliable and at scale power today at Gorgon, at TCO and refineries. We know how to build and operate large-scale power generation and integrate it to a core customer. We know how to operate these assets very, very well. We've got technical capabilities that are required to do this. In the U.S., we've got a very large natural gas position. And we've been diversifying some of our gas markets with some LNG offtake. And this allows us to backstop power investments for premium customers. We have said we didn't envision ourselves as a merchant power player, and we still don't. Building power to sell into the grid and just generate merchant power is probably not going to deliver returns competitive with our portfolio, but a high reliability at scale offering that's delivered rapidly is something that's in high demand from customers right now. You can see PPAs that have been done for things like recommissioning nuclear facilities that give you some sense of the value that these have for customers. And we've been engaged in discussions with the hyperscalers for a year or more to understand what they're looking for and understand whether or not that's something that we can we can deliver on it. And we think that it really does make good sense for us. We're got 7 of GE Vernova\u2019s largest turbines with reservation slots for delivery beginning in late '26 and then into '27, and would expect to be on the front end of what will be a real surge in power demand in this country. And importantly, the last thing I'll say is I think most of the people on the call are familiar with the challenges that the grid in this country faces right now and ensuring we keep supply of electricity reliable into the economy as it stands today. Doing this off the grid and behind the meter doesn't further tax and already tax distribution infrastructure, and it doesn't put this investment cost into the rate base and drive up costs for consumers as well. So we think this is something that's good for America. American Energy abundance can help ensure AI leadership. It's good for the public. It will create jobs and it will help to keep rates from rising and it's good for the big customers. They're looking for reliable and fast solution to deliver this power and eventually lower carbon options to reduce carbon intensity. Thanks, Neil Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Doug Leggate : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the opportunity to ask, Mike. I did warn Jake I may have a Part A and a Part B, so it's technically one question, but hopefully, you can -- I'll assume he blessed it. So the incremental disclosure on the bridge to 2027 is really, really helpful. But I wonder -- it's never enough, obviously, but I wonder if you could just benchmark against what you gave us in February 2023, I guess, under similar conditions. So what is the incremental 10, including the debt payback? What does that look like in 2027 versus, I guess, what you gave us before? And the Part B is obviously, Tengiz is the big story here. But a couple of days ago, I think the Kazakh government on the wire is actually talking about contract extensions, which is great news for you potentially, but on better terms. So I was just wondering if there was any color you could offer on that? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So Eimear, why don't you talk about free cash flow for 2027 and then I'll take the concession. Eimear Bonner : Yeah. Thanks, Doug. The short answer is it's aligned with the previous guidance. So we're really reaffirming that guidance. Obviously, since then, there's been some puts and takes. On the portfolio side, we've -- out of PDC since our last guidance. We've divested some assets as well, primarily Canada. There's been some price assumptions changed. But we do have growth laid out today out to 2026, and we see growth beyond that. We've got the CP-10 projects that will be online around that time. We'll have some Eastern Med brine feed projects in Tamar and Leviathan that will come after 2026. Mike talked earlier about the Argentina potential there and the power potential. And then in addition to that, we've got the $2 billion to $3 billion of structural cost reductions that are underway. So the short answer is it's aligned. But maybe many of the projects that we talked about a few years ago have also been derisked since then. So we'd expect to provide the 2027 outlook later on the year. Mike Wirth : Okay. Yeah on the concession, Doug, we're still focused on ramping up safely and reliable. This is a really important milestone, and it signals moving to the next phase in the life of that field. And so we're absolutely laser-focused on getting that right. Early performance has been very stable and very encouraging. As we get through the ramp up to see the plant and reservoir performance, we'll then be able to really turn our focus to the future. This is a world-class asset. We've got a long proud history in Kazakhstan and with the TCO partnership and we certainly would like to extend the concession, but it has to work for everyone. It has to work for the Republic. It has to work for our company and our shareholders has to be competitive. These things take time. These are complex contracts, complex negotiations. And we'll keep you posted as that evolves over time. Okay. And that was a clever way to get two completely unrelated questions in, Doug. So if Jake's blessed that, I better have to talk to Jake, about the ground rules in the future. Let's go to the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question about detailed update today. Mike, I wanted to ask you about policy. There's been in the U.S. now a series of energy-related executive orders over the past week. I was wondering if you could talk through how this might impact some of your oil and gas operations, especially given the large presence you have in the Gulf and then new energy opportunities and we think through the flurry of news flow over the last year. There's also been some headlines in your Venezuela license, if you could address that as part of the response. I'd appreciate it. I know a lot to unpack there, but I would love your thoughts. Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yes, that is a lot Devin. Devin McDermott : Following up with [multiple speakers]. Mike Wirth : But they're all related for you. So let me start kind of at the highest level. For years now, I've been calling for a more balanced discussion about energy. We're finally beginning to see it. We're seeing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection, all being brought together. And in the past, really the dialogue skewed toward environmental protection and much less toward the others. And I think it's a welcome change to see this reflected. It's a conversation that now recognizes oil and gas are a vital part of the energy mix in this country and in the world, which is a reality that we all need to acknowledge. And it's good to see an administration that is intent on leveraging and encouraging American energy abundance for the benefit of our economy, for the benefit of our security, for the benefit of our allies and intends to do that in a way that also provides environmental protection. So I think it's a more balanced approach. I think it's a welcome approach. And the specifics still remain to play out. Many of these executive orders direct agencies to review things, to look at actions that can be taken. And so actual actions, I think, for the most part, still remain ahead of us, but I would expect them to encourage more access for instance more regular lease sales. There is building bipartisan support for permit reform, which is very necessary, not just for our industry but for many other industries where it's become so difficult to build things here in the United States. And so I think it's a welcome reset and one that our country will benefit from. I can't much more about anything. Venezuela is an issue that has been around for quite some time during the first Trump administration, during the Biden administration. And now again, in the second Trump term, sanctions exist on Venezuela. We're the only U.S. company on the ground there. We're focused on keeping our people safe, ensuring that assets operate in a way that protects the environment and complying with all the laws. We don't set policy. We comply with laws, and we engage with the government to help inform them of the potential impacts of policy choices, and we'll continue to do so. Thanks for the question, Devin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Hi, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could talk about the position of the Permian in the portfolio. You've got this 1 million-barrel a day target out there that looks like you're going to hit if you haven't already hit it pretty soon. And I know there was a previous target in the last Analyst Day that was a little higher than that. Can you maybe just talk about the right amount of unconventionals in the portfolio? And do we think about the Permian and the DJ? Do we think about it relative to the total -- is it production? Is it decline curve? How do you think about the right amount of unconventionals for the size of the corporation over the next couple of years? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So let me start. I'm really pleased with our team in the Permian and the performance again in the fourth quarter. We delivered 992,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. We were over 1 million barrels a day in December. For the full year, we saw a growth of 18% and really, really strong performance across all aspects of the Permian. And we expect to continue to grow even as we've now passed our peak investments, and we've started to bring capital investment down. We still expect to see a 9% or 10% production growth in 2025. Something a little bit less than that, probably in 2026. And we're headed towards a lower rate of growth. And at some point, you can't grow a position like this infinitely. That was the criticism of the industry last decade is companies only focused on growing, and they never focused on generating free cash flow and returning to shareholders. And that's always been our plan to do just that. So we'll have an asset that will produce something over 1 million barrels a day for many, many years into the future. And as we can maintain that with a lower rate of capital investment than we've required to get to where we are, that really opens up the free cash flow off of that asset. So we are very pleased with that. We've got 400,000 barrels a day, give or take now in the DJ Basin, which is kind of in that plateau phase where we can draw free cash flow off of that. We closed Hess. There's another couple of hundred thousand barrels a day in the Bakken. You bring Argentina in, and now you're talking 1.7 million barrels a day or so. And this year, we produced 3.3 in change. And so it's kind of 50% of the portfolio. And the nice thing about that is that very modest CapEx you can hold that production flat for quite some time and use that as a big cash generator. And so that is the intent. There's always the prospects that we see technology breakthroughs. We're working on improved recoveries that if economic could open a new phase of growth. And I don't want to predict that, but I certainly wouldn't want to rule that out. And so as we continue to get better and better at this and develop technologies to improve recoveries, we can extend the plateau, we could raise plateaus, but this is a highly economic asset that is a core position that will generate production and cash long into the future. And of course, in the Permian, the royalty advantage that we have is kind of icing on top of that cake. And so that's how we think about it. I can't give you a magic formula, a percentage. But it's -- like I said, it's approaching 50% of our overall production, which is a significant piece. Thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the TCO distribution, and I appreciate the detail between first half and second half of this year. The $5 billion and $6 billion for '25 and '26, is that similar to the $4 billion and $5 billion respectively that you guided to previously just at a higher price deck? And further to the distribution -- it looks like based on TCO's own filings at their operating expenses from 2022 to 2023 have gone up about $5 a barrel. I'm not sure if that's related to the Russian war or something else, but I wonder if that increase in OpEx is contemplated in your free cash flow guidance for TCO, or if that's something you expect to come back down. Thanks. Eimear Bonner : Jason, yes, I can talk to that. The free cash flow inflection that's coming with -- which is actually upon us now that the asset has started up. So we shared in the slide, $5 billion for 2025 and $6 billion for 2026. What's contributing there is obviously the production but also the affiliate CapEx is coming down. So with the project completing and the affiliate CapEx is reducing significantly. And so that's resulted in the free cash flow. We also anticipate that as the plant gets [indiscernible] and the safe and reliable start-up completes that they'll be focused as well on operational OpEx and optimizing that, given the new base business of 1 million barrels a day that they will have. So that can move around a little bit during the year. But generally, we have OpEx coming down there, too. So those are two things that are contributing to the free cash flow in addition to the production. Mike Wirth : Thanks, Jason. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Thanks, Mike. I just wanted to ask about Bolivia. If you've got a good sense of why first exploration well failed and whether you've seen enough to make you want to go again in a different location? Thank you. Mike Wirth : Yeah, Alastair. The first well was the first well. And in exploration, you learn that oftentimes, particularly in a new -- relatively new basin you need a lot of information. And so each well is actually -- while you're targeting hydrocarbons, the real objective is to learn. And failure to learn would be a failure of the well. Failure defined oil and gas happens more often than not. And so we have a very large position on two different blocks in the Orange and the Walvis basins. As people are well aware, others have found some encouraging things on their blocks. And so there's a working petroleum system that exists there. And we're very pleased with the information that we learned. And it does inform future activity, and it helps us understand the geologic history of that part of the basin which is fundamental to understanding how the depositional structures and geology evolved. And we'll use that to inform future activity. We are -- it's not enough, if I heard your question correctly, it's not enough to say we're not interested. It's enough to say we continue to be interested. The other thing I'll just tell you is that the well went down very fast. The cost was much lower than some of the other wells we've seen in that area. And so I think the other encouraging thing that we learned is that the drilling environment there is one that we can execute very well in and keep future exploration wells in a very cost-effective manner. So we'll talk to you more as we evaluate the next steps in both of those basins and continue to evolve our program. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betty Jiang with Barclays. Mike Wirth : Hi, Betty. Betty Jiang : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the Power venture. I want to ask about how do you think about the capital commitment for Chevron related to that venture. It is really impressive that you were able to secure these high-demand turbine spots. So have all the deposits for them being made and just how much equity capital would you be willing to put into it? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yeah. Thank you, Betty. It's still early days, and we're not providing public details on some of the specifics of the joint developments as we move into the next phase of site selection and engineering and the like. We have secured the slot reservations with payments. And those are, again, terms that are confidential. We won't have 100% of this. It will be funded through partners and other investors. And we we'll provide more detail at the time that's appropriate on that. The one thing that I do just want to call out is we haven't changed our CapEx guidance. And so this will be done within the CapEx guidance that we've issued. We intend to develop opportunities that are competitive with other things in our portfolio. And here, you've got the benefit of scale. We've got an early position in the queue. Gas turbine generators are seeing upward price pressure. And so it's better to be early in the queue than later in the queue. And so we'll be focused on capital efficiency here and developing a project that delivers value for customers and delivers value for shareholders. So stay tuned for more details as things evolve later this year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe if I could ask one on the Gulf of Mexico, or Gulf of America, or whatever we're calling it now. You've now got two of the three projects online for the 2025 and 2026 time period with Ballymore coming soon. I mean what -- what have you seen in terms of reservoir performance so far? What have you learned in terms from these developments, both on the, I guess, on the subsurface and on the facility side? And how does it inform kind of future potential for you in the basin? Mike Wirth : Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. The -- the short story is the wells are performing very well. We've got two wells on line at Anchor. We've got a third well that we expect to come online in the second quarter. The fourth and fifth wells, we've got top holes drilled and the top hole section drilled, and we had remaining drilling and completion work ahead of us, a fifth well in early 2026. So we are able to drill and complete in this pressure and temperature regime, which is a new one for the industry. Reservoir performance, frankly, is at or above expectations. And so we're quite encouraged. On Whale, I would refer you to the operator for specifics and let them update you on that. And Ballymore, as I mentioned, online here midyear, and so we'll update you as we see performance out of that. But it's very encouraging. The Gulf of -- we're calling it Gulf of America. It's the -- that's the position of the U.S. government now. And there's a lot of running room out there. We're a large lease holder. There's a lot of acreage that is prospective for tiebacks. There's also acreage that is prospective for greenfield developments. We've brought costs down significantly. We've advanced technology to operate in different pressure regimes. And I think this going to be an important producing basin for our country for many, many years to come. Thanks, Ryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I was wondering if you can just talk about your operations in the Eastern Med today and just an update there. Obviously seen a significant improvement in the political situation in that part of the world, and there are no guarantees that's forever. But as Mike mentioned, you do have some project growth that you're working through there. So maybe just an operational update on how you're feeling about your position there and the risk as you see it today? Mike Wirth : Yeah. So first of all, we're really pleased to see tensions diminishing in the region and hopefully a lasting piece for the people there. The headline is there's no real change to our plans, John. We expect projects that are in execution at both Tamar and Leviathan to come online by the end of the year or into early 2026. There was a pipelay vessel that was demobilized during kind of the height of the conflict. That vessel will be remobilized here during the first half of this year to complete the work that it had underway. So the next leg of growth after those two projects would be a Leviathan expansion. We're currently in feed for that. It would be a significant growth in production for Leviathan. Still work to be done but that's a project that would come online towards the end of this decade and continue to step up the production on that asset significantly. So despite all the activity we've seen in that region, we'll see production up by 25% over the next two years and something closer to 50% by 2030. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America. Jean Ann Salisbury : The ramp is basically tracking to your expectations or even exceeding them and when you might have any more to share about potential debottlenecking potential? Mike Wirth : Jean, you came off mute partly into your question, and you're -- I caught the part about ramp and debottlenecking. Were you asking about FGP? Jean Ann Salisbury : Yes, yes. Mike Wirth : Okay. Good. Yeah. So look, we're a little bit more than a week into this at this point. And so it's very early days. But I will tell you, the operations have been very stable. This is a big complex process operation with crude stabilization, some fractionation, obviously, the high-pressure sour gas injection and temperatures and pressures that are significant. And so seeing stable operations is very encouraging. We have seen production step up. The well deliverability has been very strong, and we've completed all that work last year, but the field performance has met or exceeded expectations. And we feel good about what we see to this point in terms of stable and reliable operations. We'll step things up gradually to be sure that we maintain that stability and reliability. We still have very significant exclusion zones in place, for instance, to minimize the number of people that are in a plant that is just beginning to operate with the H2S concentrations that we see there. And so it will be methodical and very deliberate in raising the production levels up to full capacity. But early indications, I would say, are all positive. And any things we've encountered are well within the range of what would be normal start-up things that you see in a plant like this. So more to follow. Debottlenecking is probably a question for the future. We're really focused on getting the most we can out of this plant right now. And so we'll update you on that. I'm certainly on the next quarter call, we'll have a lot to say about performance at FGP. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lucas Hermann with BNP Paribas. Lucas Herrmann : Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the opportunity. Really just a point of clarification, Mike. You talked about the transaction with Wheatstone, or around Wheatstone with Woodside. You mentioned that -- you talked about better positioned to monetize. When you talk monetize, do you mean monetize the resource that you have? Or do you also imply monetize the facility I look to take capital out of it in some way with a potential insurance pension fund? And if I might just ask one other question. In essence, when you talk about returns on the power business, do you think about returns volatility adjusted or naked, for want of a better phrase? Thanks very much. Mike Wirth : Yeah. Thanks, Lucas. Look, on Wheatstone, we're really talking about monetizing resource over time. And we're going to acquire not only Woodside's interest in the Wheatstone project, but also in Julimar-Brunello and we'll hand over to them our interest in Northwest shelf and some other smaller related things. We've got high expectations for the Carnarvon Basin for many decades to come. We've had a strong exploration track record out there. We've got a tremendous amount of resource and optimizing that resource through both Wheatstone and Gorgon in a way that's economic, that keeps the plants full, that's good for Australia, good for customers, is important, and this gives us more control over that and a bigger stake in that. And so that's really the primary driver. We're not contemplating bringing in a pension fund or anything like that to sell down our position there. The second question or the second part of your question was about returns in power, yeah. Yeah, look, we have a volatility in our oil and gas business. We have a volatile refining and marketing business. We would look to have put in place PPAs that work for customers and work for us. And as a large natural gas producer we obviously have natural gas supply. We've got natural gas commercial capability across the value chain. And so we can use that to help manage exposure and volatility for our investment potentially for customers if that's what they're looking for. But it's very similar to how we encounter volatility in other aspects of our business, and we'll look at it in a way that is consistent with how we look at other things that have associated volatility. Thanks, Lucas. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS. Joshua Silverstein : Hi, good morning, guys. Maybe switching to the refining and chems business. We're clearly in a weak price environment and margin environment right now. Other than maybe improving the product slate and doing some cost reductions, are there things that you guys do characteristically to improve your leverage to the recovery? Maybe bring forward some projects or turnaround to fire some other assets that might be initially challenged? Anything like that? Thanks. Mike Wirth : Yeah. Having spent a good part of my career in that business, margin pressure is a familiar friend, I guess, I would say. And it does spark innovation and there's nothing like feeling kind of the sharp end of the stick to make people continue to find ways to find a little more flexibility in your feedstocks, improve your operating reliability, your cost structure. Make sure you've got all the right handles for product optimization into the market via different products via different channels to go to market and customer relationships and the like. And so I think we'll be looking to do all of those things, but we should be looking to do all those things when margins are good. And we certainly are looking to do those when margins are difficult. I would point to the fact that we're now increased capacity to run light oil at our Pasadena refinery. This is a good example of that. So we can integrate some of our upstream production that we may get a better netback on it versus exports, for instance. Will produce products that can move out into our marketing channels where we might otherwise be reliant on others to supply some of our market needs. And we can integrate intermediates with the Pascagoula refinery. We can optimize during turnarounds and storms and other market conditions by thinking of those two as a system. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities like that, which are capital efficient ways to increase your flexibility and ability to control your own margin outcomes in the downstream. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, Mike, thanks everyone. Mike Wirth : Nice to hear you back on the call, Paul. Paul Sankey : It's a pleasure to be back, Mike. I had a very quick one just about potential corporate actions. But the big idea was I was looking at your CapEx and that 14% to 16% range. I was just wondering what the chances are if you getting towards the lower end of that range because it strikes me that you could differentiate yourselves with lowering CapEx and falling CapEx over the coming years. And further to that, I was wondering, do you think there is potential, for example, for you to cut upstream CapEx once test is completed, how would that work out? Secondly, the volatility of your results. I was wondering, you underinvested in refining. Do you think that's been an issue? And then the wildcard was the potential for mega deals, the exact opposite under Trump and whether or not it might be an idea to go really big as opposed to continuing to sort of try and shrink. And then the final element of the CapEx question was if you're doing this AI gas-fired power, does it -- did you cut back -- what are the areas that you're cutting back CapEx that presumably are now less attractive under the Trump guidance such as it is? Mike Wirth : All right. Well, you have clearly pipped Doug Leggett in terms of getting the most questions into one. So making up for some lost time, Paul. Okay. So let me tick through those quickly. 14 to 16 as the range. Last year, we were at the top end of the range. This year, we're at the middle end of the range. Could we be at the low end of the range? We could. And we'll make that call based on the opportunity set, the competitiveness of those, our view on the market outlook. The real message here is, I think you can depend on us to remain very disciplined, and we're getting more for every dollar we're spending. I mentioned earlier, the Permian is growing with 40% fewer rigs and our plans contain just a few years ago. We're growing at a 7% rate last year, 6% CAGR over the next couple of years. The infamous porcupine charts show that at the time we were spending a lot more capital, we weren't delivering that kind of growth. So we become more capital efficient. And we have to continue to look for ways to deliver energy at lower and lower capital investments. Are we underweight in refining? We've always been more skewed to the upstream. If there are -- if the right opportunity were to come along in downstream or in chemicals, you'd always look at it. In those segments, one of the ways you derisk your position is by not overpaying. And so we're always attuned to opportunities out there. It would have to fit our criteria, which really are assets that have scale, flexibility can operate very efficiently would integrate into good market positions. So there's a set of criteria that we would apply to that. I'm not going to speculate on mega deals, whatever that means. And then look, the AI investment is -- the power for AI is going to fit into the portfolio like other things. The CapEx on that is manageable for sure. And it's spread out over time. It's not 100% equity on our part. And it'll have to deliver competitive returns. And so will it displace something? Will it cause something else to maybe be pushed out in time? How we prioritize those things as a part of running our business each and every day. And so we've got a queue of investments that we're constantly working on. We should not fund all of them. We should only fund the best of them. And this will go into that same process and be optimized within the overall set of investments that we're advancing. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Nitin Kumar : Good morning, everyone. And thanks, Mike for taking my question. Congrats on starting TCO. I just want to touch on the cost -- structural cost reductions you've talked about. Could you break that $2 billion to $3 billion between your upstream and downstream a little bit? You were talking earlier about the margin pressure in downstream. And then as I look at Slide 10 and the trajectory of those savings, it seems like you're a little bit weighted towards 2025. So are they more related to asset sales? Or are there other things kind of in the remaining businesses that are helping? Eimear Bonner : Yeah. Nitin, I'll take this one. Yeah, the $2 billion to $3 billion structural cost reductions, you'll see them across all segments. So let me kind of break down and the focus areas for you a little bit. The first focus areas around asset sales. So you're right, we'd expect to see some reductions this year given the asset sales last year in Canada, for example. So we will see some of those portfolio impacts in 2025. And the second focus area that we have looks at kind of changing how we work. So we're looking at standardizing work that we do and then thinking differently about where we do that work. And that will impact the downstream segment that will impact the upstream segment. So we're looking across all the businesses. I mean an example there would be how we design Whales for certain asset classes. Is there a way to do that more in a more standardized fashion and a more centralized fashion? So that's the second focus area and work is underway on that. So I think you should expect to see savings come through '25 and '26. And then the last one, maybe the one that I'm very excited about is the technology focus area. So this is where we're looking at using technology to do work completely differently. So we mentioned in the presentation, the robotics example, but there's a lot -- a long list of examples that we're deploying today, whether that's drones to inspect our facilities, digital twins to plan our turnarounds. AI to look at reducing cycle times for exploration subsurface work. The technology focus area will also deliver savings. So in terms of the profile, 2025, between $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And then '26, you should see the $2 billion to $3 billion come off then. So in total, $2 billion to $3 billion structural costs of the 2024 base. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning, guys. Question about the Permian. Clearly, you've laid out a disciplined model there to release cash flow, but you're uniquely positioned in that you have JV partners plus the royalty interest. You probably have the best view of the landscape. What are you seeing there in terms of discipline from the other operators? And is it a trend that's going to continue? Mike Wirth : Yeah, Bob, it's interesting. Because of our large mineral rights position, we not only get the financial advantage that accrues through that, but we also get the information advantage. We have a position in one out of every five wells in the Permian. And so we see a lot -- we see a lot from our NOJV partners, and most of that activity is really through five good companies, companies that you all know and cover. And so you've got visibility into what they're doing via what they say we do from seeing AFEs for funding and the like. And I would say people are sticking with their plans. And I think everybody has seen the kinds of things we are, which is productivity and efficiency gains and continuing to look for innovation and lateral length and completion techniques and proppant loading and proppant to water ratios and all the rest of it. And I don't see anybody that is kind of heading back to what the industry was doing a decade ago, which is kind of throwing all the cash right back into growth and stepping away from what they've now established, which is a more balanced return-oriented strategy. And so I can't speak for others. You'll have to ask that question specifically to other companies. But at least what I see would be a continuation of what we have been seeing is the way I would describe it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : Hi, Mike. Thanks for letting me in guys. My question really, Mike, is just on the downstream segment. It's a little bit weak last quarter sequentially and year-over-year. And I'm just wondering, was that more driven by -- I know you had more turnarounds that you talked about having about 25% less of those this year? Or is it just continue to see more, I'd call it, macro pressures there? Mike Wirth : It was a weak fourth quarter. There's no doubt about it. Margins were off. There was some turnaround effects. We also had some significant inventory accounting effects that rolled through the downstream segment and some of the impairments that we took charges for hit downstream on a proportional basis, you see the much more than you would see anything in the upstream. And so I'm not going to call it the perfect storm, but it was a quarter where there were a lot of things that all went in one direction, and it was a negative direction. And so can't affect margins. We can certainly affect turnarounds you've already seen that next year is a lighter turnaround schedule. The impairments or one-off charges and the inventory accounting is a function of LIFO layers and prices and inventory levels is a complex equation. So I wouldn't assume there's anything structurally in that business that says it's deteriorating. But you have these quarters every now and again in that business. Operator : We will take our last question from Geoff Jay with Daniel Energy Partners. Geoff Jay : Hi. Mike, I was just kind of curious about Argentina. I mean, clearly, with Malayan office, it seems like a much friendlier place to do business. You mentioned it earlier. How do you see the politics and the opportunity set changing down there? Mike Wirth : Yeah. Thanks for asking. It's an area that I am encouraged by. We've got a very strong position in the Vaca Muerta both in Loma Campana in the South and El Trapial in the North. The geology works very well. We're very pleased with what we've seen, and we've had a, I would say a moderate pace of activity. More history down in the South at Loma Campana, but encouraging over the last couple of years at El Trapial in the north. I'm also really pleased to see the situation of the country improving. We've seen inflation come down significantly. The banking system has stabilized. There's progress towards reducing and removing capital controls, President Milei is a reformer. And he's got a serious agenda that would make the country more investable for foreign investors. And we're very encouraged by what he says, and we're encouraged by what he's done thus far. I think there's more to come. And certainly, he's made great progress thus far. So we are hopeful that he'll continue to do so and that we will see an environment that increases our confidence in putting more capital to work there. So we're engaged on the ground. And right now, we're taking a look at a midstream opportunity on pipeline that could help us with exports to a good deepwater export terminal. So we'll continue to update you on developments there. But you're right. And we've seen encouraging signs, I guess, in Argentina in years gone by, and then things kind of move the other direction. So we'll be watching to see if this seems to be a more durable set of reforms and that would certainly be an important signpost for us. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Jake Spiering : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.
