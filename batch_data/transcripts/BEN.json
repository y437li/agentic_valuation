    "content": "\ufeff Executives: Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Special Equity Awards Committee Kenneth Allan Lewis - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting officer and Executive Vice President Operator : Welcome to Franklin Resources earnings commentary for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. This commentary was prerecorded. Gregory Eugene Johnson : Hello, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Fiscal year started on a positive note for us as assets under management grew to almost $880 billion by quarter end and translated into a very strong quarter of operating results. We reached new highs for revenue, operating income and earnings per share. Importantly, long-term investment performance remained strong across equity and fixed-income strategies, with the majority of our U.S. registered and cross-border mutual funds ranked in the top half of their respected peer groups. We continue to believe that our broad and diversified global investment capabilities position us well for the current environment, and that is evident in our flows this quarter. Equity and hybrid products had their strongest quarter of net new flows since '07, attracting $6.7 billion. This quarter also marked an important milestone for the integration of K2, as we launched our first liquid alternatives mutual fund for U.S. retail investors. Turning to Slide 6, on investment performance. You will notice that we enhanced the disclosure to now include our cross-border mutual funds, which are sold internationally in addition to our U.S. registered mutual funds. Combined, they represent over 2/3 of assets under management and the bulk of our retail business. As you can see from this slide, long-term investment performance remained strong, and I would note that our key global equity hybrid and global fixed-income strategies continue to have outstanding performance. Franklin Income Fund represents 14% of the total and 28% of the equity hybrid assets for the 1-year period. The fund ranked in the 51st percentile at 12/31 for the 1-year period, down from the 45th percentile at 9/30. The fund's traditional weighting in utilities, which have underperformed as of late, was a drag on relative performance. Ending assets under management continues to increase with assets ending the quarter at an all-time high of $879 billion, an increase of 4% for the quarter and 12% for the year. Average assets under management was up 5% for the quarter at $866 billion. Our mix of AUM by investment objective continues to be well-balanced with a roughly 50-50 split between equity and fixed income, if you split hybrid assets. This diversification provides our clients with a number of attractive investment options for all market cycles. The mix of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged over the prior quarter as AUM increased about equally across all regions with the exception of Latin America. Moving onto flows on Slide 10. Long-term net new flows improved modestly this quarter, reflecting both slowing redemptions and increased sales over the prior year quarter. This was an improvement from the last quarter. This quarter, we saw equity and hybrid inflows offset lower fixed-income outflows. Across the industry, investor concerns over higher interest rates have been driving assets out of more traditional core fixed-income products and into income-oriented equity strategies and a variety of nontraditional and unconstrained bond funds. Our flows have generally mimicked these trends with clients rotating into less interest-rate sensitive high-yield and nontraditional fixed-income products, as well as equity and hybrid funds. In fact, much of the exchange activity we saw this quarter was consistent with that trend. Market appreciation was $36 billion, positive across all investment objectives. This quarter, we continued to see a shift in retail demand from traditional fixed income to equity hybrid and nontraditional fixed-income products. However, our retail business remained in outflows. In the U.S., this was largely a result of continued outflows in the tax-free, fixed-income market. Internationally, outflows were driven by global fixed-income funds in the European sales region, where investors there are reallocating their global fixed-income holdings in favor of our European and U.S. equity strategies. Our institutional business, on the other hand, has fared well in both the U.S. and internationally, and offset the net outflows we saw in our retail funds this quarter. Led by $1 billion local equity mandate in Australia, we saw approximately $3 billion of net sales into our institutional business this quarter. These flows were primarily in global equity and global fixed-income strategies, and the pipeline for both mandates remains strong. We continue to expand our product range and capabilities to meet investor demand and industry trends in both retail and institutional markets. Our global reach continues to expand with a number of new regional opportunities developing. In the Philippines, we received regulatory approval to launch 2 new funds, and we continue to see demand for Islamic finance and Shariah-compliant funds. Regulatory changes in China have opened new doors for foreign asset managers who are now allowed to manage money for insurance companies. Additionally, Hong Kong is in the final stretch of talks China on a mutual recognition initiative, which will enable cross-border sales in these countries. In response to this, we have begun the development of the Templeton Asian Income and the Templeton Global Funds, which will be domiciled in Hong Kong and sold in both countries. Developments in Latin America this quarter include the launch of a local feeder of Franklin Mutual Global Discovery Fund in Brazil and a Mexican bank selected Franklin Templeton Mexico to manage part of their European equity strategy. This is a great example of the success of our local asset management business this quarter, which garnered $2.6 billion in net new flows led by our teams in Europe, Australia and Canada. Although overall net new flows are essentially flat this quarter, we have begun to see significant traction on equity flows in both the U.S. and internationally. Global Equity net new flows increased to $3.1 billion due mostly to a 21% increase in sales. This was driven by increased demand internationally for European equities, and we have seen strong net inflows into our cross-border SICAV versions of the Franklin European Growth Fund and Franklin Mutual European Funds, in particular. Given the macro environment in emerging markets, it's not surprising that we've seen outflows from key emerging markets' products. The Templeton Asian Growth Fund, for example, has suffered from a period of underperformance. We've taken action to keep clients informed about our positioning and delivered an external prospectus piece supporting portfolio management's conviction to the countries and sectors where these funds are more heavily weighted. The global fixed-income category, as a whole, is in outflows this quarter, but the U.S. versions of the Templeton Global Bond Fund and Total Return Funds had positive flows. Although these funds are labeled as traditional global funds, they are unconstrained from a sector, geography, interest rate and currency perspective. We tend to see international sales be more reactive to global events, like the Fed tapering, and are not surprised by the outflows of the cross-border versions of these products. On the flip side, these flows are typically quick to return when things stabilize. We also continue to see strong flows into hybrid funds with the Franklin Income Fund remaining the top-selling fund overall this quarter. Additionally, the Templeton Global Balanced Fund, which combines global fixed income and global equity, remains popular and is proven to be an effective vehicle for global fixed income investors to reenter the global equity markets. Moving on to U.S. equity. Long-term sales were up 11% this quarter, following strong returns in the U.S. equity markets over the past year. In the U.S., the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund remains a top-selling fund in this category as investors continue to search for income. We also saw growth in funds popular among 401(k) sponsors in the U.S., like the Franklin Growth Fund. Internationally, U.S. equity also sold well with strong flows coming into a variety of cross-border products. Tax-free fixed income still experienced outflows. However, we are starting to see signs of this market stabilizing. Redemptions are slowing and net outflows have been on the decline. But generally, higher leaves available on municipal bonds at year end may entice more investors who've been sitting on the sidelines waiting for higher yield potential. Additionally, higher taxes can make the tax exemption of municipal bonds more appealing. U.S. taxable fixed-income flows declined this quarter in line with the industry flow trends out of traditional fixed income that I mentioned earlier. However, nontraditional products within this category have been garnering increased net new flows. And now ken will discuss operating results. Kenneth Allan Lewis : Thanks, Greg. I'm happy to report a strong quarter of operating results. To begin, the fiscal year with revenue, operating income and earnings per share once again reaching new highs as a result of the growth of assets under management and our cost-conscious culture. Operating income for the quarter was $813 million, which is up 11% over the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year, outpacing the growth in assets under management over those periods. Net income was $604 million, a 19% increase from the prior year quarter and 17% from the prior year. And earnings per share was $0.96, up 20% since the fourth quarter and 19% from the prior year, outpacing the increase in net income due to our stock repurchase program that has steadily decreased shares outstanding over time. Total revenue for the quarter exceeded $2.1 billion for the first time, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. The increase in average assets under management was the primary driver of the increase in revenue. However, I would like to quickly remind everybody that last quarter's accounting adjustment obviously impacted the quarter-to-quarter comparisons as well. Investment management fees increased 7%, due mainly to increased average assets under management as well as above-average performance fees of $26 million, with the majority of that coming from K2 products. Sales and distribution fees were about $637 million this quarter, reflecting an increase in the asset base component, which makes up about 2/3 of this line; and increased fees from commissionable sales, which were roughly 12% of long-term sales this quarter. Total operating expenses increased 4% this quarter, with all but the sales, distribution and marketing expense line flat, were down from the fourth quarter. Sales distribution and marketing expense increased 8%, mostly due to last quarter's accounting adjustment, but also from the increase in the related revenues. Compensation and benefits expense was flat from last quarter, as increased salaries and wages were offset by lower variable compensation. We do expect the typical seasonal increase in this expense line next quarter as payroll taxes resume and we get the full impact of merit increases that took effect in December. In fact, last year's seasonal increase is probably a reasonable indicator of what to expect this year. Information systems and technology decreased by a seasonal 14%, but we expect this expense to exhibit a similar pattern to last year. Occupancy and general administration and other expenses both decreased slightly. G&A tends to be more difficult to predict due to the variability of several components, but the current level looks like a pretty good run rate going forward. Now that implies a larger annual increase than I guided to last quarter, however, it is primarily the result of a recent pricing structure change in Canada. This change includes the bundling of investment management, servicing and administration fees together, which we believe will make our products more competitive in that market, and importantly, is not expected to have a material impact in operating income. It will, however, change how we record the related revenues and expenses. Essentially, investment management fees will increase by about 120 basis points next quarter with shareholder servicing fees decreasing by about 2/3 of that increase in dollar terms. General and administrative expense will increase as well to offset the remainder of the net increase in revenue. So a few moving parts, and I know I went through that quickly, so please review the additional information contained in our quarterly filing and contact Investor Relations if you need further clarification. Other income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $48 million this quarter. As illustrated on Slide 19, equity method investments and realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments contributed the most to this quarter's other income gains. Equity method investments typically follow the direction of equity markets due to the nature of the assets. Realized gains from available-for-sale investments will result to pruning or liquidating over 30 seed investments during the quarter, as we've reallocated that capital to other products such as the K2 alternative fund launched in November. The tax rate for the fiscal year-to-date period was 29.8%, a bit higher than we projected at the end of the fiscal year, and that was due to a mix shift in earnings toward higher tax jurisdictions and the impact of losses from noncontrolling interest on the calculated rate. The GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 38.5%, as we benefited from some seasonally lower expenses and the growth of assets under management this quarter. As a reminder, the March quarter tends to be a tougher quarter for margins as we have 2 fewer days to earn revenue and, generally, seasonally higher expenses. And moving onto Capital Management on Slide 23 (sic) [Slide 22], during the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares, which more than offset issuance related to long-term compensation awards, and the board increased the regular quarterly dividend by 20%. The payout ratio for the trailing 12 months was 36% of net income, or roughly $800 million. The decrease from September was primarily due to last year's special dividend rolling off. This is below our recent historical average payout ratio, but it does not reflect a change in our approach to capital management. We remain committed to returning available U.S. cash flow to shareholders via a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases. And I think our track record speaks for itself, as we have returned over $6 billion to shareholders over the last 5 years. Our cash dividend has continued to grow at a rapid pace for several decades now, and we have continued to systematically reduce our share count over time with regular repurchases supplemented by opportunistic accelerations of our program activity. That concludes our commentary on first quarter results. Please see our Form 10-Q that was also filed today for additional information or contact Investor Relations if you need any clarification of our comments. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today. Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including -- in the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. (Operator Instructions). Now I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Hello and thank you everyone for joining the call today with me in our studio in San Mateo is Ken Lewis our CFO. Before we address any questions you may have regarding the earnings release of 10-Q that we filed this morning, I\u2019d like to make sure that you are all aware of our upcoming Investor Day in New York on May 22. Key leaders and investment professionals from across the Franklin Templeton organization are joining us for what should be a very informative day, so hopefully we\u2019ll see you there. If you cannot attend in person, the event will be webcast. The agenda and registration instructions are available from our website or by contacting investor relations. Now turning to our quarterly results. I think overall we feel that it was a very solid quarter. Most importantly, investment performance remained strong, and although we did experience heightened redemption activity in certain products and regions during the quarter, pre-market organic asset growth was strong in several other areas. With that, we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions. So I\u2019d like to ask the operator to open the line. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Ken a question for you, perhaps just sort of curious what\u2019s driving the increase in the comp into the second half of this year? And then, what\u2019s the outlook as you roll into the New Year? Ken Lewis : I would characterize it as planned spending, a little bit of headcount. There is a couple of things on the horizon that might be -- I wouldn\u2019t say are a trend, more of one-offs that may occur. So I was just kind of giving you a heads up on that, but in terms of the general business, there is just a couple of planned initiatives that I thought might -- or we think might increase headcount going forward slightly, as I mentioned. Bill Katz : So would you expect to build off of that as you roll into the new fiscal year? Ken Lewis : No I don\u2019t think so. I think after kind of an initial increase in the next two quarters, it should level out. Bill Katz : And my followup question is just on the Global Bond outflows this quarter, could you perhaps give us a sense of what happened as the quarter progressed and where you\u2019ve seen the deepest rate of attrition? I guess the second part of the question is, do you need to crank up the ad spend to get the gross sales to accelerate? Ken Lewis : I wish it was that easy regarding the ad spend. I think, if you look at the progression and redemptions and clearly that area has been under pressure. I think, first of all, just looking where the majority of the assets came in in Europe and a lot of money as a safe harbor was going into Global Bonds, and then when you had European equities take off, you had a reallocation. So I think that\u2019s more of a shorter term trend in pressure where people are now investing in European equities, especially European, so that puts a near-term pressure. I think for the quarter, the heightened redemptions were around the Ukraine situation and having some exposure, we don\u2019t think very much, I mean certainly 3%, 4% is a well-diversified risk for the fund, but I think if at any time you have that kind of headline risk in a fund, that can lead to some redemptions as well. So, the redemptions were clearly higher earlier in the quarter, and we feel like as we\u2019re progressing in a newer quarter that that trend is certainly improving. And I\u2019ll just also add that if you look at the U.S versus the SICAV fund, it really has been concentrated around the SICAV fund where you have more concentration with gatekeepers and probably heavier portfolio allocations to individual investors that own them for a very different set of reasons with the question of the euro at the time and problems overall in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Michael Kim : Hey guys, good afternoon. First, just a follow-up on the Global Bond Fund, just given sort of the volatility across the FX markets and the impact that\u2019s had on sort of the returns for the Global Bond Fund, I know that longer-term track records remain strong, but do you feel like the recent performance pressures maybe make it a bit harder to differentiate that fund in this type of environment? Greg Johnson : Well, I think any time you have equity markets as strong as they have been, that\u2019s going to put pressure on this type of fund. But again, how sustainable is that going forward. I think that\u2019s the question. And with regard to shorter-term performance, this fund is positioned for rising rates, and if you look at the year-to-date, anybody with longer duration, which is our peer group in the global bond area, had the benefit of rates declining, so that's put some near-term pressure, but the performance looks really fine from a standpoint of currencies and its allocation, so we feel good about it and we\u2019re always going to have under or over in the short-term, but the underperformance is very small and most of that's due to, as I said, the duration of the fund. Michael Kim : Got it. And then second question, just seems like one of the themes that maybe emerging across kind of the institutional equities landscape is just rising demand for more concentrated equity strategy. So, just wondering if to what extent you might be seeing signs of that trend, and then which of your strategies might be in a position to capitalize on sort of institutions looking for higher-asset type products? Greg Johnson : Well, I think that\u2019s been characteristic of a lot of our different funds that have concentration, and certainly you can look at an example, our Asia growth fund and our U.K. (inaudible) fund, which are concentrated -- more concentrated portfolios, so we think that trend as an active manager that making bigger bets does ultimately make sense, it\u2019s going to create more volatility versus the index on the shorter run, but again for institutions that understand that and have a longer-term perspective, I think that that trend should continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Harris : Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Greg, just want to follow-up on that first question that you answered regarding the global bond redemptions. Is it possible to kind of quantify how much of those redemptions were coming from, kind of, European investors moving up the risk curve a bit versus how much is coming from kind of issues surrounding Ukraine and maybe China slowing down? Greg Johnson : No. I mean it\u2019s really difficult, I think we just do our best job, but I think if you look at the global bond fund in the U.S. it didn\u2019t experience anywhere near the redemptions of the fund that primarily has been distributed to Europeans. So, a very different set of reasons and issues I think on each side, but clearly the global bond and total return represented about $8 billion of outflows from our SICAV fund, and the U.S. fund had just about $0.5 billion in total outflows, and that\u2019s a similar sized fund. So you can see just how different the reasons are, and in the same set of issues, I think if performance was an issue or Ukraine was an issue, I think it would hit both. I really think it\u2019s more about you had a heavier allocation for a different set of reasons for the average investor and now they are much more comfortable with more of a risk on view of Europe than they had before. Chris Harris : Okay. Yes, that\u2019s an interesting point. Okay. Follow-up question then on the U.S. equity side of the business, I mean obviously a great quarter for you guys, I am really surprised that how strong it really was and so just wondering, whether this quarter had any kind of one-offs that might affect the growth I mean I assume seasonality had some impact. And then more broadly based on the trends you guys are seeing in that part of your franchise, do you think this rate of growth is sustainable? Greg Johnson : Well, I think it really was the highlight of the quarter. I mean when you look at gross sales at 8.2 billion on U.S. equities, that\u2019s been a big push for the firm to build awareness and distribution on the U.S. equity side. There really were no one-offs as far as large institutional mandates that were funded during the quarter, so most of that was through the traditional mutual funds. I think the $2.6 billion in net flows, overall gross up 35%, I think the only concern would be that one of our best sellers was biotech which has been somewhat under pressure more recently, but everything else, you parade down the line U.S. opportunities fund, rising dividend fund, all have been strong drivers of growth, and I think that will continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Okay. This is sort of a follow-up on the last question. So in domestic equities, can you flush out more, so you mentioned biotech in terms of -- in rising dividends, but the -- as we look at kind of the publicly available data, the strength seemed to be bigger than we would have been able to maybe figure that on our own. So was there something beyond just the funds or maybe it\u2019s coming out of the SICAV products as well, so any more color you could share in terms of products and distribution would help me? Thank you. Greg Johnson : The only thing I can think of that exchanges somehow could come into that number, maybe more difficult to model, but I\u2019m not really sure why that you would have trouble figuring that out. It\u2019s really the SICAV that's been the bigger driver with U.S. growth and biotech in terms of flows versus the U.S. funds. Ken Worthington : Got it, okay. Thank you. And then in terms of K2, what should we be expecting here for the next quarter or two in terms of performance fees, if you could help us with the outlook there, it would be great. Thanks. Jim Giertz : I think if you remember back last quarter, we had -- I think it was somewhere in the 20s of performance fees. So, in an order of magnitude in the June quarter, I think you\u2019re talking about, as of now 20% of that number maybe or a quarter of that number. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee : Maybe just going through the balance sheet and capital a little bit, in the past, you guys have taken on some debt here or there which partially funded some special dividends and share repurchases, and clearly it would seem that you have more capacity to do that, so could you maybe just comment a little bit on maybe what are some of the -- in order for you guys to be comfortable doing that if that\u2019s a possibility, what are kind of some of the metrics there that you take into consideration? Are there specific leverage ratios or credit ratings that you\u2019re focused on that kind of put a governor on your willingness to maybe put a little more debt on to return a little bit more capital? Greg Johnson : Yes, so I think we got a similar question on this last quarter as well. There is no reluctance to take on debt I would say. We don\u2019t have any plans to do so either, but I think we continue our practice in the past kind of look at the overall debt ratio, look at the maturities of debt coming up, look at the interest environment and forecast and just be opportunistic like we\u2019ve been in the past. I think that also out of current cash flow generation, we have the ability to be flexible on the capital management side. The Board does look at the payout ratio that we\u2019ve been putting, putting on earnings report, so that\u2019s why we put it there, and also the total share of the return of the stock will be the two overwriting metrics. Robert Lee : Okay, and Greg, I'm just curious you talked, mentioned in Europe saying better demand in the marketplace for equity strategies and that's coming somewhat at the expenses of maybe Global Bond, but can you maybe talk a little bit about how you feel about your positioning in Europe from an equities perspective? I mean, clearly you\u2019ve built the big SICAV fixed income products but given that you still have some modest outflows from global equity strategies, did you feel like you\u2019re getting your fair share over that movement in Europe from fixed to equities? Is that -- kind of what\u2019s the strategy there to pick off more of that flow? Greg Johnson : I would argue that if you look at the world Europe we -- it's probably our best market for equities overall where if you look at the European growth fund, the mutual European fund, these are all top selling funds and it\u2019s really due to European distribution. So, as a percentage, it\u2019s heavier, the drag in Europe's been over the last quarter or two has been the Asian growth which again is not U.S. equity but in our overall equity number and that\u2019s been the third highest level of outflows for any fund. But the good news is that the performance is doing better there short-term and we had some pension redemptions in Latin America that we will then fund, but we think that's subsided as well. So, overall Europe probably the strongest shelf space and distribution position for us for equities in any other region. Ken Lewis : Rob, if I can just chime in to, I know, you\u2019ve asked about equities but just made me remember -- we\u2019ve been experienced a pretty positive trend on the Franklin income fund in the SICAV products too over the last year. So either that might be kind of an indicator or investors taking on more risk, and then as Greg mentioned, we have some strong equity showing as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Can you update us on how much cash that\u2019s outside of the U.S. right now and also your estimate of how much free cash flow you\u2019re getting from your businesses outside of U.S? Greg Johnson : The cash flow generated, it's about 50% range that\u2019s the generation part I think, it\u2019s in our filing but I feel like the numbers are 60% non-U.S. Craig Siegenthaler : Okay. So 60% of current amount. Greg Johnson : Right. And so when you\u2019re looking at net income, it's probably a descent proxy for cash flow and we\u2019re generating about 50-50. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And given no plans for a tax repatriation holiday in Verizon, what is your plan to do with the cash that sits outside of the U.S. right now and also the future free cash that you\u2019re generating over the next few years here? Greg Johnson : I think the cash is there to reinvest in the offshore business and that we\u2019re going to continue our practice there. And as you know, all of the capital management activity as well as the income tax and all that are come out of the corporate holding company, the U.S. holding company. But there is a lot of cash being generated there as I mentioned, 50% of the income which keeps growing. So, I think we have a lot of flexibility to do both fund our international growth as well as our capital policy requirements. Craig Siegenthaler : And Ken one more question, do you have the CapEx number for just reinvestment in international businesses on let\u2019s say the last 12 months? Ken Lewis : Yes, I don\u2019t have that number, but we\u2019ve made small acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to do that, I\u2019m getting a little feedback on the mic, but I don\u2019t have that number Andy. Operator : And next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Good afternoon. I guess Ken just following up on your comments about the salaries and benefits and where you\u2019re hiring or hiring, can you talk about the regions or the areas which that hiring will take place? And then any other color on any of the other expense line items for the rest of the remainder of the year? Ken Lewis : Yes, I think in general the kind of the planned expenditures relates to portfolio and also some distribution expanding our global footprint through distribution, that\u2019d be the focus of it. The business grows, we continue to support it but number that from a back office perspective, we have those low cost jurisdictions, so it doesn\u2019t impact the comp line that much. And in general I think the only other area that we\u2019re seeing increased spending is on the technology side, so I don\u2019t think it will be a lot, but may be in another 1%. Dan Fannon : Okay. And then just in terms of the redemption trends, Greg you mentioned in hybrid there were some one-off outflows and then obviously international being the area where redemptions picked up. Can you talk about specific regions outside the U.S. that might have been more elevated than others? Greg Johnson : Within hybrid? Dan Fannon : Hybrid specifically about those outflows and then just generally for the rest of the buckets and international? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean, the hybrid, the couple of factors that I think affected the quarterly flows. One, we had two or actually two separate accounts but all related to one client that with K2 that was close to a $1 billion that we previously announced and that affected the quarter and hit the hybrid number, so that was a one-time lower fee $1 billion effect. The other was a large -- one of our large distributors in their model and they had a very significant exposure to Franklin Income Fund reduced that exposure and that affected, it hit some exchange as well and the balance fund but just because of the high yield exposure they reallocated that and that resulted into what we think is again a one-time quarterly pressure because the underlying strength for hybrid in the Income Fund continues to be very good and actually this quarter with rates declining year to date that that fund did better and is back to being top in every period, so it has continued momentum. As I mentioned, the only trend around redemptions I think of note I mean Asia Pacific was actually did very well. For the quarter it was really Europe and focused on the three funds, it was the global bond total return in Asian growth and everything else would have been a great story specially on the equity side, but those three have been under pressure, they are under pressure in Europe and that\u2019s where most of those assets were raised. So, that\u2019s really the only one to highlight. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Ken, maybe just a couple of number things, so I hear you on comp in terms of the outlook, I guess just when we think about the current environment whether it\u2019s on the flows or the market backdrop, I guess when you factor in the outlook on headcount versus that just is there any change or you just saying the 1% based on hiring needs, but then obviously there is variability in the operating environment? Ken Lewis : Yes, I think there is variability in the timing, so that\u2019s why the time's a little squishy there. But generally we think we\u2019re -- when we talked a few quarters ago we talked about keeping expenses kind of in the low single digits range and I think we\u2019re sticking with that, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot of planned expenditures and if the business environment supports it, we know we\u2019ll go through with those plans but it\u2019s something that we have ultimate flexibility on. Michael Carrier : Okay got it, and then two other items which I know they\u2019re always hard to predict and they move around, but just wanted to get your sense on the non-controlling interest just seemed like it was you know more of a positive into this quarter and then the tax rate was on the opposite side and you had a little bit of a headwind, so anything in terms of the outlook, you know on either of those items, obviously they move around a lot but any color. Ken Lewis : Yes the non-controlling interest and all of the activity in non-operating income related to sponsored investment products and VIEs, I mean that\u2019s really hard for us to predict, we try to give you some colors to where, all that\u2019s related to our seed money basically in investment so we try to give you some color in our filings about what those, what categories those investments are in, but I sympathize with your task of trying to project that line item. In terms of the tax expense, we\u2019re still feeling that we\u2019re in a kind of 29.5 to 30% range. Michael Carrier : Okay, all right thanks. Ken Lewis : No, it\u2019s a factor of mix too, but based on the current projections, that\u2019s our position. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Thanks, good afternoon guys. First this question quickly, I think you highlighted in your three recorded comments, in the mini funds there was some relief in the outflows in March and was just curious if you saw that carrying through to April or if that was, if that period could just be a March phenomenon . Ken Lewis : Well you know we don\u2019t disclose flows, because -- and I think one of the reasons for that is we don\u2019t disclose flows inter quarter because it\u2019s pretty short term and things can change, but all of the -- let\u2019s put it this way, all of the commentary that we\u2019ve made you know we do see that continuing in terms of decreased redemptions in muni bonds and some of the other products that Greg was talking about. Greg Johnson : And I would just add that I think it\u2019s encouraging that the gross sales were up over 20%, quarter over quarter and certainly with Puerto Rico having a strong offering and strong demand, I mean that helped the market but overall, really the intermediate to shorter term is where you\u2019re seeing strong inflows and that\u2019s the same for us the Fed intermediates been the strong one. So I think any longer duration that you are still going to be under a little bit of pressure, but certainly a lot better than where they were a quarter ago. Brennan Hawken : Terrific, thanks for that color. And then another one on capital, you all mentioned and you highlighted a couple of times in answering Craig\u2019s and Bob\u2019s question that, and you mentioned prerecorded comments that 50% of earnings in the US, is there to support dividends and buybacks but you know is that a way to adjust and make us think about a 50% of earnings payout ratio as opposed to you know the 60 to 65% ratio that you guys targeted in the middle of last year. Greg Johnson : No I don\u2019t think that changes, I think using the word targeting is even a little bit strong but that\u2019s been a part historical rate and I think we\u2019re kind of, we\u2019ve realized that and we realized that that\u2019s where the expectations are and if we were going to change it, I think we would transmit that well in advance, so there\u2019s really no change there, I don\u2019t think you should imply that there would be a change from the 50-50 comment, but we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic and obviously it\u2019s a function of a lot of things including the market but regarding the international, there was a question earlier on CapEx, but really I think one of the largest uses of our offshore cash is product development and seeding new products. We have a lot of offshore cash in new products that are sold around the world to generate a track record for that. So, in our mind it\u2019s kind of R&D, international R&D that we\u2019re using a lot of that balance sheet for. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Sipkin from Susquehannah, please go ahead. Douglas Sipkin : Yes, thank you good afternoon guys. I hate to beat a dead horse but I think it\u2019s an important topic for you guys, particularly in light of what your comments on the last question. I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile, you guys haven\u2019t changed the target at all, the last two quarters it\u2019s well below the target, I guess what am I missing, because either, and for at least from my vantage point, either you\u2019re kind of cautious on the markets, that\u2019s what I\u2019m reading or maybe there\u2019s a strategic opportunity that no one seems to be picking up, just looking at trailing payout ratios versus your guidance. So maybe you could shed a little bit more light on that I apologize if it\u2019s repetitive, but it\u2019s definitely I think a good topic for you guys, one that matters a lot. Ken Lewis : On the previous targets trailing 12 months, so a while back we had a special dividend and that kind of rolled off, so that\u2019s where you really see the decrease happen. The special dividend at that time was primarily tax driven, there was tax reasons to do that and that is a special dividend and there wasn\u2019t a special dividend this year. So you see that the other factor is in the first quarter of this year, the markets were in a pretty good run and we just felt we kind of scaled back the share repurchase because of the overall macro-environment. But then pulled back in January and elsewhere you saw this quarter we stepped it up probably about a third over the previous quarter. Douglas Sipkin : Got you. So I guess then just interpreting those comments, it feels like maybe the stock's out of place where you guys would be more aggressive? Ken Lewis : Well I think it\u2019s a function of, it\u2019s a function of a lot of things including the overall market and so we\u2019re in there on a regular basis assessing the market and what opportunities are available. So it\u2019s kind of a day by day thing. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eric Berg : I think in response to earlier questions, you indicated that you\u2019re global equity business had a number of pluses and minuses to it with the end number obviously being a minus 1.2 billion. Would you mind just going over a little bit more slowly than -- a little bit more slowly sort of where the strength was? I believe you indicated it was in Europe but if you go over the funds then enjoyed inflows versus those that enjoyed outflows leading to the net outflow? Greg Johnson : The areas of strength within global equities would be our European growth fund which is managed by one of our local asset management team in Europe. Our mutual global discovery is another one that has done well in terms of net flows the Templeton side not -- I wouldn\u2019t say dramatic changes one way or another as far as flows and more even on a net basis. The pressure was really as I said earlier the Asian growth fund which has had about 1.9 billion in outflows and that\u2019s had a tremendous long-term performance but it is a more concentrated portfolio and obviously with pressure on emerging markets and some of the fed tapering issues, those currencies and things and some of those places got hit during the quarter and as I said earlier on the call we had some rebalancing or partial redemptions of some large institutional accounts from Latin America that we hope are kind of one-time hits and the recent performance has been very strong over the last three months. But that would be the summary in general on global equities. Eric Berg : So my second question is really a follow up to the first. As we look to the June quarter, obviously you can\u2019t get into the details of what the flows look like but conceptually would you -- is it right to be thinking of an improvement, a significant improvement in these very substantial outflows from the global fixed income area and at the same time getting more help than you got in the quarter just reported from global equity business, directional is that? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean I think it\u2019s early and why we are so careful because you know how quickly a headline can come out or something can change that can affect the quarterly flows. So as I have indicated earlier, I think some of the headline risk that affected some of those other funds appears to have moved that type of money out and hopefully that that is slowing down and we\u2019re seeing that and I hope that trend continues. But I think you\u2019re right, if I indicated we think they are one time quarterly effects on things then that would mean in a normal environment it should be better. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Marc Irizarry : Greg can you give us an update on K2 and maybe some of the new initiatives on the product side around the alternative opportunity for you guys? Greg Johnson : I think the first goal is to introduce a retail 40 Act fund and that took a lot of work to get that done as we\u2019ve said on previous calls. I think as far as distribution we\u2019re now on 45 platforms, so that was an undertaking as well. And I think we\u2019re near 380, 350 somewhere in that range million in those funds. It really hasn\u2019t the new platforms were kind of the key ones, the bigger broker dealers out there that specialize and have mandates to increase in alternative. So that I think that that side of it, the integration with people continues to go very well with the teams, so we\u2019re still very optimistic. I don\u2019t have any -- we\u2019re also very careful about setting a forecast or what is our expectation, I think it\u2019s to get the awareness out there and educate about the capabilities and then we see where that goes. But I think all of the trends around looking for alternative setting specific goals and this being one that people are pretty comfortable with or still pretty optimistic on the retail side. Ken Lewis : And also following the launch of the U.S. version of that fund, the cross border SICAV versus our funds in the works probably be launched sometime in the fall. Marc Irizarry : Okay and then just on hybrid, you may have mentioned this Greg but the uptick in growth sales during the quarter, can you give a sense maybe where that\u2019s coming, where those since some of the sources of strength there in terms of the uptick in hybrid and is that something also that you\u2019re seeing as may be more sustainable on the environment that we are in? Greg Johnson : I think there is a lot of factors, one the we\u2019ve mentioned earlier that the SICAV version of our Franklin Income Fund is starting to get traction and we had about 300 million in net inflows going into that one, also just the strength of our flagship income fund has contributed. And then some of redemptions in other areas have gone into the hybrid funds whether it\u2019s Global Bonds others that we\u2019ve seen exchanges moving into more of the balanced funds and that affects the overall gross and hybrid. So we think that that\u2019s a trend that will continue and especially the fear of rates rising and having different type of exposure to that will also contribute to more balanced hybrid funds. Marc Irizarry : Okay, then, I know, it\u2019s tough to get too much color around this but just in terms of your seed portfolio on non-op gains, how should we think about what we saw this quarter maybe what the book looks like today and what the non-op, how should we think about non-op free cash? Greg Johnson : I think the best thing and the thing that we can do too is just kind of look to see generally speaking, so a lot of that is our trading investments, so you look to see like what categories are trading investments? As we go through the quarter, if it\u2019s global equity or if it\u2019s fixed income markets, you can kind of get some feel for where that line will be, it gets a little more completed because as funds get successful, we'll deconsolidate the funds, so that\u2019s a little hard to predict even for us, so there\u2019s always going be a margin of error for that but at least in our filing, we show you where the money is invested. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much in terms of composition by investment object over the last few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I guess this is a two part on performance, I\u2019m flipping through the queue. I noticed a pretty material improvement in the one year performance in both hybrid and in fixed income, so much so that, I guess, question is, one, was there a roll-off of a tough period four quarters ago because improvement is significant; and two, given that significant improvement, does that change your near-term ability to cross sell or to sell through both hybrid and tax rate just on these better results because they are much better? Greg Johnson : Well, I think that, I did mention earlier that Franklin Income Fund is a driver for us for hybrid flows to $90 billion fund in the U.S. and it was lagging I think last quarter, and the difference is rates have dropped that has more longer term duration in it\u2019s typical categories, so what rates do we\u2019re are going to drive that fund's performance specifically with exposure to groups like utility that has unperformed a quarter or two ago. So that will drive the shorter term number. It\u2019s not really -- it was just a better recent numbers, not -- there was nothing unusual or dropping off of prior quarter. It was just if rates go down, that one tends to do better than its category because it does have a higher yield than other hybrid type funds in its category. Ken Lewis : And I think last quarter was below the second quarter. Greg Johnson : Just below, right, just below. Glenn Schorr : But tax free is a little bit different story? Greg Johnson : Well tax free for us again, it\u2019s really the function of duration because we position ours for lower volatility, higher tax free income. When rates drop, we tend to underperform in the short run but because we have lower fees, we tend to fine, in the longer term when we find that, that area if I have to wait, total return is less important than certainly equities, as far as how our market looks at them because our markets buying them more for stability and current income than they are trying to get an extra 20 or 30 basis points total return. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Greg Johnson : Okay, well, thank you every one for participating on the call and we look forward to seeing many of you, May 22nd, New York. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties, and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin\u2019s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. This commentary was pre-recorded. Greg Johnson - Chief Executive Officer : Hello and thank you for listening to our third quarter earnings commentary. I am Greg Johnson, CEO and I am joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. There are number of positive developments during the quarter, but most importantly, long-term relative investment performance of U.S. and cross-border funds remains strong across equity, hybrid and fixed income strategies. Assets under management ended the quarter at over $920 billion, a new high for the company and a 13% increase from the prior year. Long-term net new flows rebounded to $2.5 billion highlighted by strong flows into hybrid strategies and a return to positive flows into fixed income. Profitability remains strong with year-to-date operating margin near 38%. Cumulative share repurchases and dividends for the trailing 12 months period was $1 billion, roughly approximating after-tax net cash flow to the U.S. parent company. As illustrated on Slide 6, relative investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border funds is strong with the majority of assets in the top two Lipper or Morningstar quartiles across all standard time periods. It\u2019s worth noting that our various hybrid funds that have been attracting strong flows continue to have exceptional long-term performance. In fact, Franklin Income Fund has top decile performance over all of these time periods and was recently awarded a five-star rating by Morningstar. The cross-border version of the fund has performed just as well. Ending and average assets under management rose again this quarter, increasing about 4% and 3% respectively. Assets under management remain well-diversified by investment objectives, sales region and client type, with the mix of assets essentially unchanged from last quarter, but we are gradually seeing a shift toward equity and hybrid products, as well as to the U.S. sales region. Not shown in this slide is the breakdown by client type, which remains approximately three quarters retail. Our diversified asset base allows our clients to build diversified portfolios within our fund family and has historically enabled us to weather tough macro environments that caused certain strategies to temporarily fall out of paper. This quarter was no exception, as flows benefited from the diversification of our asset base, gaining further traction with various targeted, global and regional sales and marketing campaigns. Industry wide, retail and institutional sales slowed from the March quarter. Equity was the hardest hit. However, fixed income flows had a strong rebound as sales picked up and redemptions eased. Our flows generally mirrored these trends as long-term sales decreased slightly to $47.5 billion, within the average range we have seen for the past several years. But importantly, redemptions slowed significantly to $45 billion, their lowest level in over a year. This quarter we saw traditional fixed income flows remain neutral and some relative flow weakness in equities, but the appetite for hybrid remains strong and global fixed income strategies return to positive flows. The latter two are areas of emphasis for newer campaigns that were rolled out earlier in the year. Those campaigns are intended to support financial advisors with client discussions and highlight relevant Franklin Templeton Funds. An example of this is our income for What\u2019s Next campaign, which is a retirement focused campaign to prepare investors for income generation during retirement. Products highlighted included the Franklin Income Fund, Rising Dividends Fund, Global Bond Fund, and Federal Tax-Free Income Fund. Moving to Slide 11, we enhanced the regional flow disclosure to provide more transparency on flow trends by retail and institutional channels within each region. Retail flows returned to positive territory this quarter following three consecutive quarters of outflows. However, international retail remained in net redemptions predominantly fueled by Europe. With that said, Europe\u2019s retail redemptions declined by 40% and were a big contributor to our improved net new flows this quarter. In the U.S., retail flows improved resulting in its best flow quarter since March 2013. Even with muni bonds continuing to be a drag on flows. Institutional flows improved this quarter, led by global fixed income, where we saw the most interest in our global multi-sector plus strategies. However, global equities continue to experience outflows, due primarily to a few lumpy redemptions totaling $1.5 billion. This quarter we also saw interest in our emerging market capabilities where we had notable fundings in Malaysian equity and Thai equity accounts. The pipeline of unfunded committed wins look strong for the fourth quarter, as we are seeing demand for emerging market debt and global bond plus strategies and we anticipate three larger than average $1 billion plus mandates to fund during this quarter or next. Moving to flows by investment objective, global fixed income improved significantly over the prior quarter with $1.4 billion in net new flows. Strength in the quarter came from emerging market bond institutional demand for global multi-sector plus and strategies, managed by our local asset management teams in India, Korea and the MENA region. The cross border, Templeton Global Bond and total return funds remained in outflows, but both experienced increased sales and lower redemptions. The U.S. registered versions were essentially breakeven again, with net new flows of less than $100 million. In fact, all told, the global bond team realized essentially breakeven flows for the quarter. Our sales and marketing teams continue to focus and educating clients on the funds, and why they are well-suited for today\u2019s fixed income landscape. On the global equity side flows were still slightly negative, but it\u2019s worth mentioning that we are seeing a significant recovery in our emerging markets equity products, which drove the outflows last quarter and came to close to breaking even this quarter. U.S. and cross-border versions of the Templeton Asian Growth Fund, in particular are recovering with significant declines in redemptions over the prior two quarters. Global Equity Strategies, managed by our local asset management teams continue to be a bright spot and two of the best flowing products this quarter were cross-border funds managed by our European and Indian equity teams. In some instances we have been able to successfully export local management expertise for our cross-border funds, which is a nice way for us to build scale in those teams. As investors re-risk towards equity, we have primarily seen flows into our various hybrid strategies as we are actively promoting our balance funds as a way to diversify investors from fixed income into equity, without fully committing to an equity fund. It\u2019s no coincidence that Franklin Income Fund, which drew net new flows are approximately $1.4 billion was our best selling product this quarter. Over the past year, we have also seen a steady increase in demand for the cross-border version of the fund, which recorded organic growth over 90% this quarter and had over $3.6 billion of assets at June 30. It took this fund roughly 12 years to reach $1 billion, and only about three more to add an additional $2.5 billion. We are also seeing strong traction with our Templeton Global Balance Fund for U.S. investors and the cross-border equivalent, Templeton Global Income Fund, which were both launched in 2005, and combine the expertise of our Templeton Global Equity and Global Bond Teams. These funds are top quartile performance over almost all time periods, and have combined for better than 70% pre-market organic growth year-to-date. These funds have appealed to investors looking to diversify away from global fixed income. As we have seen exchanges as well as new money coming into the funds, which have nearly tripled in AUM in the last two years to a combined $4.8 billion as of June. U.S. equity, on the other hand, had modest outflows, along with the rest of the industry. Our Franklin Small Cap Growth and Franklin Rising Dividend Funds with the top flow gainers, but a pullback for our cross-border biotech discovery and U.S. opportunities funds contributed to the variance from last quarter. Moving on to domestic fixed income on Slide 14, flows into our municipal bonds are trending towards breakeven, with just $400 million in outflows this quarter. Despite the industry continuing to see positive net new flows since January, our focus on the longer duration investor has slowed our turnaround because investors generally remain more interested in short and intermediate term funds. While longer term we expect this recovery to fully play out ongoing headline risk around Puerto Rico may continue to affect these flows over the shorter term. With that being said several key funds within this category have turned positive, primarily those with short to intermediate duration. U.S. taxable fixed income net new flows remained slightly positive at $200 million with inflows into high yield and floating rate products more than offsetting the outflows for more traditional fixed income strategies. We continue to execute on strategic initiatives such as international growth, and positioning ourselves to capture retirement assets. This past quarter, we held a retirement plan adviser symposium for defined contribution investment only advisers and well attended client conferences in the U.S. and Asia, which gave us the opportunity to showcase our capabilities. For example, the forum we hosted in New York was attended by a 170 institutional clients, consultants, research professionals and plan sponsors representing approximately 30% of our AUM. That event also allowed us to efficiently leverage the time of many of our senior portfolio managers and business leaders while hosting our first Investor Day, which we hope enhanced your understanding of the Franklin Templeton story. I will now turn it over to Ken for financial results. Ken Lewis - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was $787 million, which was a slight increase from last quarter due to a number of factors, which I will go into shortly. Net income increased to $579 million, a 3% increase from last quarter due primarily to increased other income and earnings per share was $0.92 also a 3% increase. Total revenue of $2.13 billion is an all-time high and a 2% increase from last quarter. Investment management fees and the asset-based component of sales and distribution fees benefited from higher average assets under management and the additional day in the quarter. The increase in investment management fees from last quarter was below the pace of average assets under management growth due to a slight shift in the mix towards lower fee products. The mix of assets under management has been trending towards hybrid, institutional and U.S. registered global fixed income funds and away from emerging markets, which has yielded a slightly lower effective fee rate of around 62 basis points excluding performance fees. Sales and distribution fees increased 1% as the increase in the asset-based component was partially offset by lower cross-border sales. Shareholder servicing fees increased 2%, consistent with the increase in billable shareholder accounts. As you may recall from previous years, Canada typically purged closed billable accounts in the third quarter, but the switch to a bundled fee this year means that they are no longer charging shareholder servicing fees. The purge of closed U.S. accounts occurred in July and 1.2 million accounts were removed, which will be reflected in the financial results next quarter. Operating expenses increased 3% with most of the increase coming from the asset-based component of sales, distribution and marketing expense, which included non-recurring items of about $12.2 million, which if excluded, would have resulted in a 1% increase, in line with the revenue increase. Compensation and benefits expense was $380.7 million, primarily reflecting increased variable compensation due to increased operating income. Also included in variable compensation is the mark-to-market of long-term mutual fund awards for investment professionals. Information systems and technology expense was $54.3 million, an increase of 6%, as some of the typical fourth quarter seasonality was realized this quarter. Occupancy and general and administrative expenses were little changed from the previous quarter. So, looking ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate meeting the 4% to 5% of year-over-year expense growth I guided to last fall though expectations for some specific line items have changed. Our current expectations are for compensation and benefits to more or less be flat next quarter. Technology, occupancy and general and administrative expenses combined should increase somewhat. Turning to Slide 19, on operating leverage, fiscal year-to-date operating income was almost $2.4 billion and the operating margin was 37.7%. As I stated in my comments at our Investor Day in May, we do not run the business to meet a margin goal, partly because the accounting for sales and distribution expenses can have a significant effect on GAAP margins. Our focus is on delivering operating income growth, which is tended to lead to margin expansion over time. Other income net was $96.7 million this quarter, but as you can see on Slide 19, it included substantial gains from consolidated sponsored investment products, which were offset by non-controlling interests. So therefore, better way to look at other income is net of non-controlling interests, which was $52.4 million. The primary contributor to other income was equity method investment gains of $34 million, which was reflective of a strong global equity market this quarter. The tax rate came in lower than expectations at 28.5% for the quarter and 29.4% for the fiscal year period, but that is partly a function of pre-tax income being inflated by non-controlling interest and consolidated sponsored investment products. If not for that noise, the rate would have been in the 29.5% to 30% range we expect. Moving on to capital management, we updated the slides this quarter to augment our discussion of capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares, continuing our track record as a net buyer of our stock, which has steadily decreased shares outstanding and added roughly 2% average accretion per year. The new chart on the bottom of Slide 22 illustrates our five year historical share repurchase activity and although the pace of repurchases did slow during last fiscal year, this was largely due to the large special dividend of $640 million we paid at the beginning of that period. We have remained consistent buyers of our stock and have accelerated the pace of repurchases when market pullbacks offer better opportunities, such as in 2011 and the September 2013 quarter. The good news and bad news here is that there have been few if any material debts to buy over the past year or two. In fact, the S&P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered an official correction in over 1,000 trading days and counting. The last correction occurred roughly 34 months ago, which is a long time when you consider that corrections have occurred on average about every 18 months. Slide 23, is an updated view on capital return, but rather than focus on payout ratio of net income, it focuses on actual cash distributed through dividends and share repurchases. We believe this is a better way to look at it, because the payout ratio is based on net income which is not adjusted for foreign earnings, particularly when compared to peers that have not scaled their foreign operations like we have. That said we did include the payout ratios for dividends and repurchases on the chart for reference. Over the trailing 12 months, we distributed $1 billion, primarily through share repurchases. While feedback expressed by our fellow shareholders is pointing to a variety of preferences one common thread has been a request to distribute as much available cash flow as possible, without unnecessarily triggering tax on undistributed foreign sourced earnings. And that has actually been our practice for many years. Though the pace of distributions has been below that of a year ago, we remain committed to returning U.S. free cash flow to shareholders over the near to intermediate term. Turning to Slide 24, we have updated the net cash and investments chart to include a breakdown of U.S. and non-U.S. net cash and investments for the prior fiscal year end periods. While we do believe in the benefits of having a strong balance sheet, the growth in net cash and investments has primarily been offshore. Total net cash and investments was $8.8 billion at the end of the quarter. To illustrate the fact, that we have historically distributed essentially all of U.S. generated cash flow, this slide shows that net cash investments in the U.S. has averaged about $1 billion over the period shown in this chart. And the reason that we have not shown the breakdown at quarter end, even though it\u2019s included in our filing, is that we did not want to complicate the message by discussing the seasonal adjustments required to account for intra-fiscal year cash flow timing differences. That being said, we would expect our U.S. cash investment balance to be a little higher at the end of this fiscal year, due to some large seed capital investments that we made in 2014 like in the new Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund. Our goal is not to grow the balance sheet, though we are optimistic that fundamental corporate tax reform will eventually occur. That concludes our prepared remarks and we look forward to the live call later this morning.",

    "content": "\ufeff Executives: Greg Johnson - Chief Executive Officer Ken Lewis - Chief Financial Officer Analysts : Operator : Welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Commentary for the Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014. Please note that the financial results to be presented in this commentary are preliminary. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources Inc. which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. This commentary was prerecorded. Greg Johnson : Hello. And thank you for listening to our fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and, I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Importantly, overall long-term relative investment performance of U.S. and cross-border funds remained strong across equity, hybrid, and fixed income strategies. Stronger net new flows into fixed income products and ongoing organic growth of hybrid and income funds were essentially offset by outflows from some of our equity products. Financial results ended the fiscal year on a high note, with quarterly and fiscal year record highs for revenue, operating income, and net income. On the capital management front, cumulative share repurchases and dividends for the fiscal year were just shy of $1 billion. During the quarter, we also completed a multi-year effort to deregister as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve, while preserving limited trust and fiduciary activities for our high net worth clients. As slide six illustrates, long-term relative investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border funds remained strong. Hybrid and global fixed income strategies in particular have done well with top quartile performance across most funds and time periods. In fact, both the Templeton Global Bond and Templeton Global Total Return Funds were recently awarded a Five Star rating by Morningstar in the U.S. Assets under management ended the quarter at $898 billion, down 2% from June, 30, reflecting the market pullback that happened at quarter end. Average AUM on the other hand increased 1% to $912 billion. This quarter, there was a slight shift towards fixed income in the U.S. sales region, but we remained well-diversified by investment objectives, sales region, and client type. This quarter, we experienced lower long-term sales, not unlike the general industry trend and a slight increase in long-term redemptions, resulting in long-term net new outflows $800 million, inclusive of a discrete high net worth redemption that I will touch on. A significant portion of these outflows were offset by exchanges and flows into cash management products, leading to nearly a breakeven net new flows for the quarter. Market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange revaluation on non-USD-based products decreased AUM by $21 billion this quarter. Retail flows turned negative again this quarter due to lower sales activity, which is consistent with industry trends to the positive retail redemptions continued to improve U.S. retail, which was impacted by equity outflows slipped into slight outflows overall despite improved global and tax-free fixed income flows. International retail outflows increased modestly as continued improvement in Europe was offset by lower sales and increased redemptions from Asia. Institutional had a solid quarter driven by an increase in international flows, particularly from Europe where we had a $1 billion mandate fund this quarter, which helped to offset a couple of lumpy redemptions from international clients, also totaling $1 billion. On last quarter\u2019s call, I mentioned that we anticipated three mandates of approximately $1 billion to fund over the second half of the calendar year. Of those three, only one mandate actually funded over the past quarter. Overall, our institutional business had a strong year with much of the success due to the growth of the institutional pooled vehicles 3(c)(7) and 3(c)(11), which was a strategy we continue to broaden. These vehicles allow clients to not qualify for their own separate accounts to obtain institutional pricing for smaller accounts. Not illustrated on slide 11 are flows from high net worth clients, which experienced about $800 million of outflows this quarter. Roughly $500 million of that was redeemed from a tax-free fixed income portfolio by a client for state planning purposes. Moving to flows by investment objective, global fixed income continued to improve attracting $2.5 billion of net new flows. Top quartile performance in our efforts to promote the unconstrained nature of our flagship global bond funds are beginning to pay off with the U.S. and cross-border versions of the Templeton Global Bond Fund and Total Return funds returning to inflows for the first time in over a year. Global equity flows on the other hand were weaker this quarter. The most of the delta can be attributed to three large institutional redemptions, totaling $1.3 billion. On the retail side, global equity was impacted by redemptions across funds with either a focus or heavy weighting in Europe, as investors were concerned about the European economy. On the positive side, the cross-border Franklin India Fund had another solid quarter due to inflows from the Chilean pension system, which also reinvested into the cross-border Templeton Asian Growth Fund this quarter. The Asian Growth Fund has historically been a significant driver of global equity flows from our international clients and returned to inflows this quarter after four consecutive quarters in redemptions. Although the majority of these sales continue to come from South America, flows have also been coming from more developed market such as France, Poland, and Germany, showing the effectiveness of our international campaign focused on emerging market strategies. U.S. equity outflows also increased on lower sales and higher redemptions. We did see solid inflows into our small cap fund as well as positive flows, the popular rising dividends fund, but did experience over $900 million in outflows from our cross-border biotech fund. They contributed to much of the outflows this quarter. Hybrid flows remained solid with the U.S. and cross-border versions of the Franklin income fund accounting for about $1.8 billion of net new flows this quarter. The cross-border version generated particular interest in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Italy sales regions, and the global income fund continued to attract very strong inflows. In fact, our various hybrid strategies attracted $10 billion of net new flows during the past fiscal year. Overall, tax-free fixed income remained in outflow this quarter, as investor preference remains focused on short and intermediate duration in higher yield strategies. However, net new outflows from our funds improved again this quarter when adjusted for the high net worth redemption noted earlier. U.S. taxable fixed income continued to generate slightly positive net inflows, with the U.S. and cross-border versions of the unconstrained Franklin strategic income fund representing our top sellers this quarter. We did see decreased interest in our floating rate funds as investors became vary of reduced spreads on high-yield bonds. Before I turn it over to Ken, I\u2019d like to discuss a few developments on our international growth. Sweden, United Kingdom, Australia, and India combined, generated about $6 billion in net flows this year. In South Africa, our Shariah and Sukuk funds have been approved by the local regulator and are designated to launch in November. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Ken to discuss financial results. Ken Lewis : Thanks, Greg. I\u2019m pleased to report to you a record revenue, operating, and net income. Fiscal year operating income topped $3 billion for the first time and was up 10% over the prior year, while net income increased 11%. Diluted earnings per share of $3.79, increased 12% from last year, outpacing net income due to our continued repurchase activity, which has continued to exceed grant issuance and steadily decrease shares outstanding. We also had record revenue, operating income, and net income for the quarter. Diluted earning per share was $1.02 and net income was $641 million, both up 11% from the prior quarter. Now, taking a look at revenues for the quarter, Investment management fees increased 3% which was above the growth in average assets under management due to an additional day in the quarter, and $12.4 million in performance fees. Sales and distribution fees were $627 million, a decline from last quarter due to several moving parts, the most significant being lower sales and a decrease in the sales-based fees. The asset base component increased due to the longer quarter and higher assets. However, much of that was offset by an accounting classification of rebates from sales and distribution expense to investment management fees and sales and distribution fees. This decreased investment and management fees by $2.7 million and sales and distribution fees by $5 million. For more information, the appendix on slide 27 breaks down asset and sales-based distribution fees on both the net and absolute basis as the 10-K will not be available until mid November. Moving on, shareholder servicing fees were $68.3 million, a slight decrease and consistent with the typical seasonal patterns following the purge of U.S. closed accounts in July, that I discussed last quarter. And other net revenue was $29 million this quarter. Total expenses for the quarter decreased 2%, which is better than what we\u2019re expecting even after normalizing for some accounting adjustments and one-time items that I will explain. Sales distribution and marketing expense decreased 4% this quarter, which was a slightly larger decrease in the associated revenue due to an adjustment to an accrual recognized in the prior quarter and the reclassification of rebates that I mentioned. Combined fourth quarter sales and distribution expense was lower by about $14 million from these accounting items. Compensation and benefits expense decreased this quarter to $366 million, due to lower fixed and variable compensation. Information systems and technology expense increased 12% over the prior quarter due to a seasonal increase in technology, typical of the fourth quarter that was larger than we expected. Occupancy expense was $36.7 million this quarter, an 8% increase due primarily to expenses related to the required restoration of two leased global office spaces that we are vacating. General, administrative and other expense was $101 million this quarter and although this line can exhibit a bit of seasonality in the fourth quarter, there also tends to be lumpier one-time expenses such as those we experienced this quarter. During the quarter, one of Darby\u2019s private equity funds, which we consolidate, recognized a gain of $16.9 million on the sale of a portfolio investment, which triggered carried interest payments of $22.8 million. Now because of funds consolidated that carried interest is not included in reported revenue, however, we did recognize about $13 million of related expense as 50% of the carried interest we shared with the team and the fund also had to expense $1.7 million of legal and professional fees associated with the transaction. So this resulted in an increased compensation and benefit expense of $3.8 million, and G&A expense of $9.3 million. Although the consolidation accounting for this event created some noise and decreased GAAP operating income and the margin, the net impact which included a realized gain of $16.9 million in other income carried interest expense and a non-controlling interest component increased net income by about $12 million. Turning to slide 20, the operating margin this fiscal year was almost 38%, which reflects the growth and profitability we saw this year. Importantly, as we continue to effectively build scale in key markets, revenue has grown faster than expenses. In fact, we now have 18 countries and regions with over $5 billion in assets under management. The fiscal year tax rate was 29.3%, which was a little lower than what I had previously guided due to an increase in income attributable to non-controlling interests as well as a decrease in various state taxes. Other income, net of non-controlling interest was $58 million this quarter. Slide 21 does a good job of illustrating the key components, but I will touch on a few . Gains on available-for-sale investments were $19.2 million. As you may recall, we hold a significant amount of offshore cash in U.S. dollars. Due to the strengthening dollar in the quarter, we had about $44 million of unrealized foreign exchange gains from entities with the functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. This is offset on the balance sheet via other comprehensive income. And finally, consolidated sponsored investment product losses of $4.8 million were net of the $16.9 million Darby Private Equity investment gain I already highlighted. Looking now at capital management, we continue to buyback share systematically, but once again, there were few opportunities for more opportunistic repurchases this quarter. In total, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $178 million, almost a 40% increase from last quarter. And for the fiscal year, we repurchased 11.5 billion shares at a cost of $622 million which decreased average shares outstanding by 8.9 million shares. The total payout for the quarter including dividends was $253 million. The fiscal year payout was $923 million and the company has paid out about $7 billion since the first quarter of 2009, reflecting our commitment to long-term shareholder return. Net cash and investments grew to $9.2 billion this quarter and is predominantly non-U.S. cash and investments. Net cash and investments in the U.S. also increased this year due to the lower level of opportunistic share repurchases that I just mentioned, higher domestic seed capital requirements, and building liquidity in anticipation of an upcoming debt maturity. So that ends our prepared remarks and we look forward to the live call later today.",

My name is Lorraine, and I will be your conference operator today. Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, in the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. [Operator Instructions]. The company asks that you limit questions to one initial and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions]  Now, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Hello and thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO and myself for this quarter's conference call. Financial results and relative investment performance remained solid. The institutional business had one of its best flow quarters and fiduciaries secured one of its largest new wealth management relationships in firm's history. Although net flows were weaker, retail clients showed an increased interest in key products within our U.S. equity tax-free fixed income and global bond franchises. Now, at this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : First question just on the flows in the quarter and then in the outlook. I think on he recorded call, you just mentioned that your institutional is really strong. Then in December you had a spike for a couple of reasons on the retail side. I do not know if you could give any color on how significant that spike was in December, just to kind of get a better run rate axe some of the volatility that we saw around whether it is global bond fund or just the market new environment. Greg Johnson : Right, I think, we felt like it is certainly worth discussing. We did not try to go back and quantify because of the difficulty with omnibus, but what happened with the Templeton Global Bond funds is we had a $0.60 special dividend rate at year end and there is not a warning for that kind of a currency dividend and it kind of got the market a little bit off guard and we saw a real spike in redemptions. Also, it's hard to quantify, because many of the omnibus accounts track that as a redemption and then reinvest it. We think it is somewhere in the $1 billion range potential overstatement of redemptions, but we didn't want to adjust any numbers. We just kind of went the number that we had, but we know that that December number is higher and as we have said January is a more normalized redemption rate. Michael Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. Then, Ken, maybe a couple of things to clarify on some of the expense guidance that you gave, so first just on the comp, I think you mentioned 2% higher in the next quarter. Just wanted to find out if that excludes or includes the $8 million Darby comp related number. Then just two other items that seemed a little bit lower were the shareholder service revenue and the other revenues. I think, other revenues you said this could be at the higher end, so just wanted to get some color on what's driving that. Ken Lewis : Sure. The 2% is our estimate of the absolute reported number, which includes the Darby. Other revenue, we are forecasting that to be lower, because basically because of the bank no longer have that banking business, but the other items that is unpredictable that goes through that line relates to consolidated SIPs. Excluding that, we do think the run rate for other revenue is going to be lower going forward. On shareholder servicing, we think that this is probably about a good run rate for shareholder servicing going forward. Michael Carrier : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Ken Lewis : The shareholder accounts have been stable and increasing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Luke Montgomery : Good morning. Thank you. Just first on the special dividend, obviously, that is appreciated by some investors, but it was about half, what you did a couple of years ago. I know the tax and legislative environments were different then, but if you could give us a little insight as to the discussion with the board on the size of the special and really how that intersects with where you are and your cash flexibility and the U.S. cash balance. Ken Lewis : Sure. Very robust discussion, at the Board Meeting in December, dividend is very much a Board decision. One of the factors that they looked at they felt like it was appropriate to target returning 50% of current year's earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. They looked back at 2014, they saw that we that goal, so that was a key influencer on doing a special and the size of the special dividend. Essentially, as I mentioned in the pre-recorded remarks, I am targeting 100% of the U.S. cash flow seem like a reasonable objective at that time and that was factored into their decision. Luke Montgomery : Okay. Helpful. Thanks. Then I was hoping that you could update us on your latest thoughts around liquidating in the emerging-market portfolios. I think that Templeton Global Bond fund keeps about 15% of total AUM in cash, and I realize also that management liquidity is a quarter of what your PMs do, but does Michael continue to believe that cash level is sufficient? If you could comment on the potential for selling, because there have been some new less than favorable articles in the press that cite the large percentage of certain countries' sovereign debt that you guys are on and how you will be positioned if those drop in value and the fund expenses more redemptions or redemptions. Greg Johnson : I think, obviously, that is something that all of our portfolio managers monitoring and take very seriously looking at liquidity and cash and I think we just felt like some of the coverage, looking at fixed income fund like an equity fund and trying to look at the turnover and extrapolate that for liquidity doesn't really give you the whole picture, so I think the combination of the high cash positions along with the very low duration and maturities of securities that happened within a very short period in the fund, those two factors alone and then sometimes the flexibility of working directly with Central banks and selling positions creates liquidity that is not always measured, so there's many sources of liquidity that I feel like that area is probably one of the best as far as the liquidity, but it continues I think because of the nature of some of the holdings and a 2.2% position in Ukraine gets a lot of focus with the headlines right now. I think they feel comfortable, the team, and I think we feel pretty comfortable with liquidity there. Luke Montgomery : Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Ken Lewis :  Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Michael Kim : Hi, guys. Good morning. First, as you highlighted earlier, just looking at sort of the relative returns across some of your bigger flagship funds. The three year numbers generally remained strong, but some of the funds have been underperforming a bit over shorter timeframe, so just wondering how you are thinking about where you see the biggest organic growth opportunities, particularly assuming the markets remained choppy and risk appetite remained sort of lackluster. Greg Johnson : I think there are pockets of the strong even on a shorter term basis and some of the Franklin funds, Franklin growth fund, another fund that we started a few years back, our focused equity fund was doing very well, so that is kind of gaining traction. I think, looking at the short-term relative underperformance. There is no question that the strong U.S. dollar has taken its toll certainly on Templeton that has a longer term approach and doesn't hedge against the dollar, so this kind of unprecedented move does create headwinds for certainly that area. The other big one that moved just slightly into the bottom, the third quartile would be the Franklin income fund. Again, very consistent with how those funds run with high yield bonds some of the volatility during the quarter in that area. Then also, high yield bonds tend to have a larger percentage in energy and oil that had an impact as well, so that is just slight in the third and does have a big short-term effect on our numbers and it is nothing unusual there. I think, some of the good stories in areas of continued growth, the Franklin, the India fund, which is in our SICAV, had a very strong quarter in-flows and that is up I think about 45% for the year, so that continues to do well. Then the institutional opportunities, I think we fell like the pipeline is as strong as ever in categories still, global equities, emerging markets debt and we continue to see opportunity for growth there. Tax-free has come back to slightly positive flows for the quarter and it has take while to get there, but again we think that that is well positioned and has good relative performance to hopefully get some organic growth. Michael Kim : Got it. That is helpful. Then maybe just a follow-up for Ken. Beyond some of the more specific line item guidance that you referenced, any just sort of broader thoughts on expense growth looking out to the New Year, particularly given sort of the step-up in market volatility and at some point do you maybe start to pull back on some discretionary spending and just curious where you might have some of that flexibility. Ken Lewis : I think, history can show you that, we have a fair amount of flexibility and controlling the expenses and certainly with revenue levels where they are, it is something that is top of mind so we are talking about that I think you will see the expense levels that or you see the expense growth start to level out going out a few quarters as we tapped the brakes on expenses, but that does take a little bit of time to work through the system too, but certainly we are thinking about going back on the expenses. Michael Kim : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Greg, just one kind of big picture question, so as you look out over the next three years what drives Franklin to the next level of growth? I would say Templeton brought in that big level kind of pre-tech bubble, and I think it was income series post-tech and global bond franchise post credit crisis. You have got different initiatives, different regions, different products that also seem like maybe they have potential, so kind of let us know what you are most excited about and what at least has the opportunity to be the focus for Franklin over the next couple of years. Greg Johnson : I think it is hard just to look at one area and say that is going to drive organic growth like global bonds or like Templeton had. I think they are all hopefully, we would like to see is a very diversified organic growth with all those areas and I still think the strength around the hybrid area, the balanced area still continues to be good grower and good potential for organic growth. The tax-free has had a tough run, but there is no reason why in a stable rate environment, we can't get growth back there. If you look at the global bond, I would still argue that the performance continues to be very consistent. It is an alternative category. While it is the 800 pound gorilla in its category, it still has very low penetration for the average retail owner. I think in a sideways, with auto market, that stands out as a very good alternative. You look at one area for us just this year, which shows I think the strength of our distribution and product line and where opportunities we didn't talk about a year ago, but with the yen devaluation in Japan, we have seen our global bond funds really take off in that market and that is at the very early stages. We are just this quarter we had over $1.3 billion in flows into global bond and that's a new channel for us. I think it is hard just to call out any one area. The K2 fund continues to grow. We think that is a nice one and the alternatives we just kicked it up in the cross-border area and we are getting a lot of interest there. As we talked about the institutional initiative, I mean, if organic gets somewhat lost in the numbers, but $4 billion in-flows coming outside of the U.S. into institutional net is again a very significant growth number that we think is getting better and better, so that would be a few. Ken Worthington : Okay. Greta. Thanks very much. Ken Lewis : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate thinking the question just sort of following up on growth may be a little more tactical in nature. as I run my eye across some of your gross sales dynamics, yes, there is a little improvement, sequentially, but when you look on a longer-term basis now last couple years you seem to be sort of a relatively down to flattish type of backdrop. What specifically, what might you be targeting in terms of growth initiatives to try and capitalize the net flow dynamics sort of adjusting for the spike in redemptions towards the end of the year. Just trying to see what gets the nets going at this point. Greg Johnson : We do target organic growth rates, but I mean at the end of the day, you look at where the opportunities are with the specific products in different markets and position, and $50 billion in gross sales a quarter is a pretty strong accomplishment for a distribution, but when redemptions, the pressures of volatility and movement, even in this last quarter there were a lot of our European growth funds, which tends to attract a little bit faster money and added $1.2 billion in net redemptions, which put a lot of pressure on the equity flows. Then you look our Asia growth fund and another one that reversed from a positive quarter to a negative, which was about $1 billion difference quarter-over-quarter, so you hope you can reduce those and get back to steady, but I think its volatility in specific pockets and a lot of headwinds, certainly with currencies in emerging markets, those create pressure and make it just harder to get that organic growth. I think it is difficult to sit here and say, well, this is where it is going to happen or not. I think, again, the focus is going to be on delivering performance, consistent returns. Then hopefully the rest takes care of itself. I know that is [ph] exactly answering the question. As I said before, a more diversified mix and strong performance is really what we can control and hopefully that organic growth takes care of itself. Bill Katz : Okay. That is helpful. I just want to follow-up. Second question is, just as you mentioned the global bond fund is low in sort of early stages of retail opportunity, when you step back and you think about sort of franchise risk. I do not mean to use that term to lightly, one of the lessons I think we have learned with concentration, it cuts both ways. When it looks good, it looks good. When it hurts, it goes bad pretty quickly. How are you thinking about that just given the size of the aggregate portfolio? You used a word 800-pound gorilla in your response to prior question. How you think about that sort of letting that business continue to grow versus thinking about what might be some franchise risk if there was a problem with building that going more deeply. Greg Johnson : Well, I think it is like any business. You want to make sure you watch carefully the risks in the larger portfolios and where assets are concentrated. I think, we do a pretty good job. Also, whether you would consider closing something that is more related to investment performance and liquidity than it would be to the risk to Franklin Templeton, but I think we do have still a very well diversified asset base. If you look at every category, where we have investment management, I would still put it up there against anybody in the industry, so I think like any business you make sure you watch carefully those larger concentrations with assets, and I think we do a pretty good job of that. I think from a growth standpoint, it still has potential to grow, because sovereign debt is large and getting larger. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian, your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Can you hear me? Operator : Yes. Brian Bedell : Yes. Okay. Great. Hi, good morning. Greg, if you can talk a little bit of more about some of the differences between what you are seeing in sales demand in Europe versus the U.S. for really the global and international equity products. Just trying to get a sense of that tempo as we come into the first quarter, again, more on the sales side versus the redemption side? Greg Johnson : Yes. I think the press, it is a little bit different. Our mix in certainly Europe and Asia versus the U.S. and the big drivers for us, tend to be that Asia growth fund, which is sold in all over Europe as well as Asia. You do tend to see more volatility in both gross and redemptions and that is more of a sector-oriented norm, more the platform-driven model and that is really what has put a lot of pressure on the global equity outflows for the quarter, where you had volatility in the currencies as well as emerging markets, they are having a relatively weak quarter against the rest. Europe, obviously, it was, a lot of money moving into it a quarter or two ago and now it seems to be the reverse and probably the same in Asia, but the good news again is that when those markets rebound you will see the sentiment change. I think for the U.S. it is more of a steady state for us and I think the challenge has been, more recently we had a strong rebound in Templeton performance, but again the value approach, the overweighting in Europe and the exposure to the U.S. dollar is going to create some retail headwinds for us in the near-term, but you just have never seen this kind of markets where the S&P has had such strength against the MSCI. I think for the year, what was about 13%, 14% return for the S&P versus 3% for the rest of the world and minus 5 for emerging markets, so that I think tells a little bit of the story right there. Brian Bedell : Then maybe just adding to that on the fee mix shift, obviously if you had the worst fee mix shift coming into the December quarter, as we move into 1Q, I guess, first of all was there anything unusual that changed that. Then second of all, I guess, would you see that trend continuing into the quarter given some of the dynamics of what has happened most recently coming into quarter end? Greg Johnson : Right. I mean, the only maybe unusual thing would be that we had less performance fees. I think that was the delta quarter-to-quarter was maybe like $10 million less of performance fees. Brian Bedell : Okay. Greg Johnson : \u2026so you factor that in, but excluding that, asset under management mix shifts relatively away from global equity to U.S. in percentage terms or relative terms than you are going to see that decline, so it is really a factor of assets under management shift, then maybe also but to a lesser degree, the mix between retail and institutional. Brian Bedell : Right, and you are seeing greater strength in institutional right now. Is that correct? Greg Johnson : We have seen that. Yes. We have seen that last couple of quarters, so that is reflected in the decrease in the effective fee rate. Brian Bedell : Right, Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just want to go back to the balance sheet a little bit. I understand, clearly, the desire to return 50% of cash flow, I guess to U.S. earnings, and that drove the special dividend, but can you maybe talked a little bit about kind of how may be they thought of it that versus a step up in share repurchase, particularly since as you guys rightly point out over the years you have actually done a good job of driving down the share count over time, so I am just trying get a sense of that dynamic. Then maybe the second part of that would be, I know you have some debt that comes due in a couple of quarters. In the past, I think the only reason you really put even leverage on the balance sheet was to fund some specials and share repurchases, so given the capacity you have for additional borrowings and kind of what may be the appetite you can put a little bit more leverage on to step ups some share repurchase going forward. Ken Lewis : Sure. Greg, just talk about the S&P up last year, and the board have the benefit of hindsight looking back and seeing that the share repurchases were not maybe at levels they were previously. Since we are opportunistic that was clearly understood and justified in their minds, so they said this would be a good way to top that up and meet our objectives. Going forward, it does not change really our strategy going forward in any material way, so we will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases. If there is a significant pullback in the market, we will step it up and vice versa, so that will continue. Regarding the debt, the other thing that is kind of in the back of folk people's minds is, the whole discussion about tax reform and there is recent news and talk about a potential building introduced regarding repatriation for infrastructure, so we are keeping an eye on that and that may change the view of the board and the view of management in terms of share repurchases or dividends, so we will wait and see on that. In terms of the debt, you are right. I do not think there will be any significant change in our overall debt position, which I guess implies that we are leaning toward refinancing it, but that decision has not been made yet. We will probably talk more about that next quarter. Robert Lee : All right, great, then I have question maybe actually look at the DCIO business. I mean that has, I think, been a good business for you guys over time, but certainly the DC business has been changing a lot the last several years with growth target date more pressure on plan sponsors in terms of fee disclosures and all kinds of things, so can you may be talk a little bit about how kind of the changes are reshuffling in that space and kind of what the current strategy is or any thoughts on, are you going after kind of an open architecture target date, just trying to get a sense of how you are viewing that market segment? Greg Johnson : Well, I think you have kind a hit on the big changes. For us, going after open architecture target dates is kind of a difficult road, because there is really limited access to do that. I think what has happened part of the reason why U.S. domestic equity and large cap and traditional core funds continues to struggle. As a standalone fund, it is just hard to get access and you are going to have to get access through a target date fund. In the past, you could get on the platform as a standalone independent fund. Today that is very difficult, so target date, especially where you have proprietary client contribution plans continue to be I think I am appropriate way for individuals to get a better diversified portfolio that changes over time. For us, I think the net effect is that you have more specialized funds, which are still accessible or still in demand on those platforms, but it is just going to be harder and harder to get say the Franklin growth fund get distribution in a DCIO plan versus other types of products that could be a small cap or could be a global bond ones that are viewed as separate from the core holdings. I think that the net effect, I mean, DCIO is still very attractive channel of growth for us certainly versus defined benefit. We put a lot of resources into it and we have seen incremental growth there, but I think the target date area is just hard for an independent asset manager do well versus people that have the proprietary plans. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Yes. Good morning. A quick question on the global equity sales, it seems on a gross basis, and the trend has been pretty steadily downward in that and for those products. Can you help us understand what is driving that and what efforts are being made in order reverse that trend? Greg Johnson : I think as I have mentioned, I mean it is just this kind of strength of the dollar has created headwinds for Templeton and then Europe more recently, so I think we are always looking at ways to strengthen the process and diversify and look at risks. Those are the things that we are doing, but as I said earlier what are you focused on, you are focused on investment performance delivering long-term results and that is really what we are trying to do there, but I think we are more sensitive now to the difficulties and just one factor, which has been the strong dollar and looking at whether or not you would hedge those or kind of things you can do going forward. Those are the kind of things we are going to look at, but as we have seen in the past the short-term numbers can turn pretty quickly and general consensus is the dollar continues to run, but who knows. I mean that can turn too and that all of a sudden short-term relative performance looks fine, but I would agree with your assessment, that is an area where we have lost share and one that we are very focused on right now. Brennan Hawken : Okay. If we think about it on the constant dollar basis, what would those numbers look like on the gross sale side? Greg Johnson : Yes. Again, I just do not really look at, we study the market share numbers and I just do not have that in front of me what the gross sales for the global equity looks likes over time. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks. Greg Johnson : Try to get it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Greggory Warren : Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know we touched on this a little bit sort of the near-term performances issues, so I am not going to go down that path. I was just kind of curious when you think about sort of the global international bond portfolio, I know you have talked about the fact that it is negatively correlated to U.S. interest rate. We should see better performance out of that platform as rate start to rise. Do you think you face a deferred headwind sort of that investor mindset that they should not be buying fixed-income funds when rates are rising? Ken Lewis : Yes. I think there are some absolute some truth to that, and I think certainly and that is why we debate even health advisers place it in the portfolios to say, this is part of their fixed income and it is almost we would argue it should be an alternative or global macro or something other, because the duration exposure is so low and it is part of the redemptions that we saw when rates rose earlier was exactly that that people to say we were going to lower exposure to fixed income, so you do a risk there. I also think that the market will differentiate fixed income once you have a real rising rate environment and you look at returns and this will stand out something that holds up very well in a rising rate environment. I think that will be the bigger driver over time. If you do well in the rising rate environment, there is not going to be many places to go and hopefully that is where you get some attention and growth. Greggory Warren : Okay. Good, on that front. I guess my other question relates sort of to where we are looking at expenses and margins for the year. I think you noted in the pre-record call and also a little bit here, but our compensation expenses might be a bit higher this year than it was last year and try to make up for another in the P&L, but is the assumption that margins won't be significantly better than they were last year, there we are not going to see sort of expansion of margins. Is that sort of a takeaway we should have from that? Greg Johnson : I think it is revenue story as much as it is an expense story. We have seen assets under management level declined last two quarters. That is eventually going to reflect itself in the growth rate of revenue year-over-year. When we have some flexibility on expense side, and we will react to that, so it is really challenging to say what the margins will be the same or different from year-over-year. I think the best guidance I can give you is to look back to see what happened in 2008, 2009, 2010, and some of the actions we took back then to see what flexibility we have. Greggory Warren : Well, I hope it doesn't get that bad. Ken Lewis : That's a worst case scenario. Greggory Warren : Okay. Ken Lewis : Which I think we reacted pretty well there. Greggory Warren : Yes. It was fantastic. We have gone through that period. Thanks for taking my question overall. I will get back you if I have anymore. Ken Lewis : Okay. Thanks. Ken Lewis : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eric Berg : Thanks very much. Good morning it is Eric Berg from RBC. Greg, it seem like a number of your competitors, your direct competitors are reporting strong flows in fixed income despite the prospects for rising interest rates whether it is in passive strategies or in active strategies that are less than traditional, unconstrained total return. There are a number of competitors that I could cite that that are reporting solidly positive fixed-income flows. I have sort of had one question with two related parts. How are you feeling about your over all around the world fixed-income flows and what are the prospects near-term? Greg Johnson : Well, I think the fixed-income picture, while there is certainly a consensus that rates are going up, the other consensus is not within the next year, so fixed-income has performed extremely well and those with the longer duration have done even better. Then you have had a little bit of dislocation in the marketplace as we know and that created some movement. I am sure there is one firm that is not enjoying large fixed-income flows right now. That has resulted in some other ones having very strong in-flows. I think, we have very strong funds in those areas, we have seen growth not to the level that the other more institutional-oriented players that matchup take a little bit better as far as what the consultants are going to drive and we are getting some of that opportunity, but probably not to the level of a couple of others. I still think that is a good opportunity for us and one that, again, we have seen incremental growth and positive flows, but I think not to the level that the couple of other names have and that is really what you are speaking to and I would still think that I would put that in the list of still a growth opportunities for us, we have funds, we have strong records in that area and sometime it just get pushing up between the two or three more obvious names there institutional markets. Eric Berg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. Greg Johnson : Okay. Well, thank you everybody for participating on the call and we will look forward to speaking next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Franklin Resources' earnings conference call for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc. which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Eugene Johnson : Hello, and thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO, and I today to discuss second quarter results. Overall, there was a number of positive developments in the quarter, however, much of that was overshadowed by redemption pressure on global bond funds. Importantly, overall relative investment performance remains strong, and we are encouraged by the continued strength of our institutional and high net worth businesses as well as improved flows in several key areas. I'd now like to open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First, love to flesh out the success you're having on the institutional side. We've seen a number of quarters of success, was hoping to get more detail. So what part of institutional is resonating best with Franklin? So I think last quarter you said it was really non-U.S. institutional wins. Is it insurance companies? Is it pension and endowment? Again, any better color there? And then what segments are you highlighting to them? And then I guess the last part of this question is, is there anything in the marketplace you see helping your success outside of the additional committed resources? Gregory Eugene Johnson : I mean, I think it really reflects the effort that we started years ago, and made it a corporate priority, where we felt like the retail side was well-represented across the world and, really, institutional, we didn't have the penetration that we felt we should have. And as we've said in prior quarters, I mean, most of that has been outside United States. We spent a lot of time developing relationships with sovereign wealth funds. A lot of others have opened up insurance companies, and other areas in certain markets that were not opened to outside managers have opened up. And with our strong presence in many of those markets, I think that's resulted in sales as well. The area continues to be more fixed income. Templeton still has strong relationships, and we saw some significant Templeton wins in this past quarter. But really, a lot of it has been around the fixed income side, and global ag and emerging markets debt. And that continues to be where we see the strongest pipeline. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then the follow-up, just on DCIO. How big is DCIO for you now? What's the strategy behind the push? And I guess similar to the other one, what products are you highlighting for the channel? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Well, it -- I don't know what the exact numbers. I'm sure we can get that for you. But for us, we've always felt that the defined contribution, especially an investment-only open architecture, will work in our favor. It's been relatively closed market for record keepers, and the trend and pressure towards open architecture, it opens up more opportunities for us. And you can take even within the segment the opportunity around target-date funds. It's very hard to sell your own target-date fund if you're not -- if you don't own the recordkeeping, but the more recent trend of even opening up target-date funds to outside managers within their proprietary product I think is a near-term opportunity and be a near-term focus for us. So you look across the product line, I think it -- we're well-represented on the equity side. And certainly, with Templeton and global bonds, it's a relatively new area in the investment only. But the majority of the opportunities are always going to be around the equity side and global equity side in the DCIO market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Greg, you mentioned on the Global Bond, you're just seeing the redemptions pick up, and I think you mentioned that most of that was being driven outside the U.S. So just curious, during the quarter, obviously there was a lot of volatility in the market, but was there anything that you would kind of put your finger on in terms of what was driving that? I know in the fourth quarter there was cap gains and stuff that was driving it. And then from a marketing standpoint, can you just -- what's -- what are the wholesalers doing to try to, I don't know if it's educate or try to get clients to understand what the product is? And when you go through this volatility, how to try to maybe steady some of those redemptions? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think it is challenging, and part of the challenge is that it's a relatively new category and one that we have such a dominant share in. It's hard to really see how you're doing against peers and what are the expectations of investors. And I think we said last quarter the redemption spiked for the U.S. fund, and that actually improved significantly quarter-over-quarter. The big spike was in Europe, and really, it's even harder sometimes to get a handle on what the end shareholder is thinking about when much of that is sold through platforms and gatekeepers. And if we drill down further, we can see specifically the markets where we had very fast and strong growth are the ones that are having higher redemptions. And if talk, as I have talked, to our distribution, they feel that there's a couple of factors working there. One, there was such a high level of fear in markets like Italy of where the euro was heading, where that market was heading, and a lot of a client's portfolio got put into global bonds. So they think a lot of this is a reallocation now in a more normalized environment where the euro looks stable. European equities are always going to be the dominant share of any European's portfolio. That really is the trade right now, so a lot of money moving back into European equity. So we can -- it is specific really, the high-level of redemptions that we're seeing, to those specific markets in Europe that probably had the highest level of concern over where the euro was heading, and we got those quick, large sales is where we're seeing the greatest pressure. And it's I think somewhat challenging from an education standpoint. For those that feel that they want to get back into equities, that's really what they're going to do with a portion of that portfolio. And from our perspective, a couple of things. I mean, I think that fund in that market will do better when it's a risk off environment in some ways and certainly when it comes to the euro and European equities, and then if rates rise at some point because it's positioned for that as well. So I think those are 2 of the key areas in turning around the more near-term flows. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you just -- you gave some expense guidance on the prerecorded call. I think -- I just want to make sure, the G&A, I think this level you' re saying : comfortable with. IT, I think you're saying 1% to 2% for the year. And then just occupancy, didn't know if there was anything there or on comp, whether it was in the quarter that was unusual or the go forward? Gregory Eugene Johnson : I think that the maybe one of the unusual events in the quarter that affected all those line items was FX. So just that alone, while it did not have a significant impact on operating income on the expense side, it did have a decent favorable impact on comps. So that's maybe order of magnitude of $6 million or so. And then you probably have another maybe $3 million, $4 million in the other expense lines related to FX. So that's one reason we expect expenses to go up. So I think if you look at the comp line, I'm expecting that to go up a little bit, maybe 1% occupancy, yes, I'm expecting that to go up a little bit as well. And then just to be clear on the information systems and technology line, that guidance is projected 2015 versus projected 2014. So that would imply a pretty big increase next quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : First, just to follow up maybe on, Greg, your comments on DCIO. Just curious to get your thoughts on sort of the recent proposals from the DOL, and any potential issues more broadly or how that might impact your business, if at all. Gregory Eugene Johnson : Yes, I don't think it's going to have a big impact on our business. It's because, again, we're more of the content provider. We're not the point-of-sale person in that. And I think regardless of what happens, they're still going to need DCIO plans. So I don't think that fiduciary standard would have a big impact for us one way or another. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then maybe one for Ken, just to follow up on the outlook for expenses more broadly. I think last quarter you sort of talked about reserving the right to tap the brakes so to speak, just assuming AUM and revenue growth flattened out. So just wondering if you've maybe started to rein in some initiatives at this point? Or is it still kind of steady as she goes? Kenneth Allan Lewis : It's somewhere in between, I would say. We're talking about initiatives, but kind of in the, if you will, the easy-to-cut expenses, things are already in motion to slow that down, slow down hiring a little bit. So that's been communicated throughout the organization and we're seeing some of that come through the income statement. And we will see that too. But it does take time, and there's always a little bit of a lag to these things. And I guess I'm guiding up on expenses a little bit from decisions that were made in the past, and that will probably come through the next couple of quarters. But today, we are definitely taking a little bit closer look at expenses and putting a little bit more pressure on cost savings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. You called out K2 as having some nice momentum and getting some scale, and then you also mentioned in your prerecorded call that you have a couple of products in the wings. How quickly do you think those products can come to market? And how quickly do think you might be able to leverage them to add an incremental layer of growth? Gregory Eugene Johnson : I think they can come to market pretty quickly within probably 3 months or so. And what -- I think the hard part is really getting the first one out there on platforms. And I think that's really where we've made key inroads, is having I think 72 platforms now that that's represented on, so that will make it easier for us to bring the next. And it really now is starting to get momentum here in the last few months where we're seeing larger trades and more interest, and now it's up to I think $840 million between the 2 funds. So it's always -- the first few years on a new product are always tough to get going, but this one, I think we are all very optimistic that we can expand that and really start to make a meaningful contribution to flows. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, that's interesting. And then, Ken, just to clarify. I thought I heard in the prerecorded call that G&A would look like last quarter, not this particular quarter, but fiscal first quarter as we look out to the next quarter. Is that right or wrong? And then just heading back, when you think about the comp dynamics, I think you called out that there was a little bit of a decline for variable compensation due to lower sales. So sales pickup, is there still operating leverage that can be driven off the comp line looking ahead? Kenneth Allan Lewis : I think there's a little -- yes, I would agree with that. On the variable comp side, there's -- we have some room there. Regarding the general -- G&A expense, I'm talking about the quarter that ended December. So more like that level versus... William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So $90 million, if I recall correctly, somewhere in that ballpark. Kenneth Allan Lewis : Yes, we're in that ballpark. Right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : You mentioned the expense benefit from FX but said there wasn't really much impact on operating. So it's fair to assume then that the negative revenue impact is pretty close to 1-for-1 on the numbers you gave? Kenneth Allan Lewis : I wouldn't say 1-for-1. I think there was a positive impact on operating income but just wasn't material relative to operating income. It definitely impacted revenue and expenses, but they offset somewhat. Not entirely though. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : Okay, good. And in that vein, is there any one currency or index we could use to better forecast the foreign exchange revaluations in other income? Kenneth Allan Lewis : Yes, I think in this quarter it was the euro-dollar, which I think is up I believe 13% or something like that. And so in this particular example, we did have -- we have a subsidiary that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar that holds U.S. dollars. And so it's just kind of an oddity of the accounting rules. It does get offset in other comprehensive income, but it does add to the volatility in income statement. So -- and [ph] that was a euro to dollar. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : First question I have going back to flows. So if I look at the broad franchise, I mean, one of the attributes of you guys is you have a lot of big franchises, whether it's global bonds or equity income or from the Templeton equity strategies, mutual shares. And I guess one of the challenges you have is some of -- multiples of those, I guess, are suffering through some not even really high rates of redemptions but enough to kind of put them in outflows. So if you look across those, are there any 1 or 2 that you could look at where right now you're having some flow issues? Maybe it's the Franklin income products, where you feel like you're starting to feel like maybe it's settling down or you feel more optimistic about the ability to kind of get those franchises flowing in the right direction again? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think it generally will relate to where your shorter term performance, what is driving that, on whether you're going to be optimistic around a turnaround. I think the good news for Mutual Series, which historically has always had exposure to Europe and always benchmarked against the S&P, that's been a real drag. And they hedge, Templeton doesn't, so their more recent numbers are looking much better on the mutual side. And certainly, Global Discovery is doing well in the global equity side, and I think that will continue to be a near-term driver of flows that we're pretty optimistic about right now. And then I think the silver lining with Templeton, that because of Templeton's historical philosophy of not hedging the dollar, that's been a significant drag on relative performance as well as on just assets for us. And that, combined with the value discipline of, again, overweighted in Europe, that's been a near-term drag. And that in the last month or 2, the dollar seems to be leveling here, which is helpful. And then Europe for the first time, as well as all markets outside of the U.S., outperformed the U.S. So maybe that's the beginning of a longer-term trend that from our asset mix would be I think very beneficial. The other area, hybrid area, for us, you had a little bit of backup in the high-yield bond market that created some fear there. But again, we feel pretty good about the hybrid and Franklin income flows despite that anytime you have a high weighting of high-yield bonds, you're going to have more energy exposure and that created the shock over the last quarter. And that seems to be a little bit better. So those are the areas that I think we're more optimistic about in turning flows around. And then you take an area like municipal bonds. It's been under pressure the last few years. That's turned around into positive flows here over the last quarter. Hopefully, we can start to see a pickup there as well. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Great. And maybe going to capital management and the share repurchase. You mentioned that you put in place a, I always forget -- the 10b5-1 program. So is it possible to give some color around that? Kind of maybe size or how you -- the structure of it around strike prices, things like that. Kenneth Allan Lewis : Well I'll try to give you a high level because it's just fairly complicated when you get into the details of the mechanics. But I guess the first question is why did we do it now. And what we were seeing was kind of a reduction in tradable volume for us. And we felt like this would help us meet our -- we're not changing our capital policies or strategies, but it would help us meet our goals because that was sort of a challenge for us in time. And so the idea that during the period where we would voluntary block ourselves out from trading, we have this 10b5-1 plan, so it just opens the window up for more trading days for us. And in general about the mechanics, it's -- we try to be more -- buy more when the price is down during that period and buy less when it's up. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then maybe one last question. You called out that the high net worth business as being an area of some relative flows and growth. I mean it isn't a business really over the years that has been talked about too much. So could you maybe refresh us, kind of size it and what you're seeing there in terms of new business flows and maybe if there's any kind of incremental investment or expansion of that, that's taking place? Gregory Eugene Johnson : I think our goal is to grow that business and make it a more meaningful contributor and get scale from size. And so that -- whether that's through an acquisition or continues organically, that's really -- we know that needs to be bigger. I think we're just pleased, and I wouldn't call it a trend. It's just a lot of work's been done to get some, I think, major wins with that group, and we want to just highlight that. But it's something you wouldn't just expect to happen every quarter to have $1 billion in net inflows going into that segment, but it's progress in the right direction. And on a base of $10 billion or $12 billion or $14 billion, wherever it is, today, that's meaningful to that business and important in growing the bottom line. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So question here on the excess debt capital you guys raised. It looked like you raised about $400 million for a -- to pay down $250 million of outstanding notes. Would the excess then be used to boost U.S. domicile cash and potentially fund some buybacks? Kenneth Allan Lewis : Yes, that's one [indiscernible], but yes. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. And then there's also been chatter -- on the capital front, there's also been chatter on the D.C. out of a potential repatriation holiday. And could you talk about how you would view a reduction in the tax rate in order to bring some cash back stateside? Kenneth Allan Lewis : Yes, I think that the devil's always in the details on these things. But clearly, conceptually, if it was advantageous to the shareholders, and from a tax perspective and from a capital management perspective, we would take advantage of any repatriation law that was enacted. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great, and then last one, quarter-to-date, we've seen emerging markets bounce nicely. Can you give any color on what you've seen here quarter-to-date, whether or not some of the trends that you noticed sort of and highlighted here in recent months, whether or not that's been continuing and maybe even gotten a little extra fuel as we've seen emerging markets bounce? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think we're careful about trying to give any kind of indication where we think flows are going this quarter. I think, as I stated, it's helpful to have the stronger performance certainly in areas that have been dragging, like emerging markets. And I think that will help a lot of our different products, but it's probably too early for that to translate into a shift in flows right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So year-to-date, your performance fees are tracking down a fair amount relative to last year. Just wondering if you guys can comment a little bit on that dynamic and maybe what the outlook might look like for the second half? Kenneth Allan Lewis : Yes, sure. I don't think that we'll have a repeat of last year in the second half of this year. I think what drove most of the performance fee -- the incremental increase in performance fees in 2014 was from K2. And at this point, it doesn't look like that number will repeat itself for the second half of the year. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, follow-up, kind of a bigger picture question. The global macro team, just curious to get your guys expectations for how that team is going to operate. And if everything goes according to plan, what kind of impact might that have on the franchise? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Well I think it, hopefully, will result in just better collaboration with the different groups. We've always been a company that has had a lot of autonomy with its investment groups. In the groups, there are different sources, different research organizations for information. And we just felt like we have such a strong team in place with a team of PhDs and led by Michael Hasenstab, that it makes sense to try to leverage that. And certainly, the other factor of near-term performance with what central banks are doing I think is becoming more important to traditional stock picking that we tend to do. So it's not something that we're going to push on the groups. It's just a way for us -- for them to have another resource and a view that I think will result in an overall more consistent view for the various different groups in the company. And part of that is thinking about currency when you're looking at global equities. And whether you decide to hedge or not, that's up to the various groups, but this will be a strong voice and a strong opinion on looking at currencies and how to add alpha through currencies instead of just leaving that up to the individual group. So I think that's where we'll see probably the majority of change. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Maybe just staying on the theme of global macro team, maybe Greg, if you could talk about the potential to launch new products that are based on some of the global macro research, particularly in alternative, and whether that opens up any new distribution channels. And then, as you mentioned, this helps create a lot of different ideas and unified research perspective. Is there any view that you would centralize any type of -- centralizing any type of research, I guess, throughout the firm in terms of pushing that down onto investment mandates? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Yes, I think it's early to talk about what effect it would have on products. I think the near-term question is when we look and discuss Templeton and the philosophy around not hedging and how that's been so detrimental when you have this kind of move for U.S. investors, a year where the dollar's been up 25% against a basket of currencies. So I think those are kind of in more near-term discussions. You wouldn't go hedge everything, but you would certainly consider hedging some of the funds or some of the classes of shares for those that want to have that protection and potentially lower volatility. So I think that's where you'll see the near-term effect on products, but that's still something that we're discussing with the groups. I think the other part, how does it affect our solutions, our tactical asset allocation, I think all of that we're still working towards coming up with what we think is the most efficient way to leverage all of that expertise we have in-house. But I think, first and foremost, for that group is they manage close to $200 billion, and that's really where you want the -- their focus to remain. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just maybe a question for Ken on the info systems. Can you talk a little bit more detail about what your -- what the plan is there in terms of what you're working on that's driving the elevated expense in the second half of the year? Kenneth Allan Lewis : Could you just repeat the question, please? Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Sure, yes. On the info systems expense, so the shift up. And we're up -- we're going to be up 1% to 2% on a year-over-year basis. So the shift up into the second half, if you can talk about, a little bit about what you're doing in that area in terms of project build, and I guess whether that's going to continue into next fiscal year as well. Kenneth Allan Lewis : Yes, this information systems and technology line, it's pretty hard, it's very hard to predict. There's a lot of big projects underway and there's project plans, and sometimes they come in on time, sometimes they get delayed. But we do and have had some fairly big system initiatives underway. They tend to be more operational in nature, HR systems, fund accounting systems, that kind of thing, and they tend to be multiyear. So I guess the only point I'm trying to make here is the expenses have been lower, and I just didn't want people to think that, that is a good run rate going forward. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes, that's fair. And then maybe just while we're on the topic, is there any thought to ever outsourcing things like fund accounting and some of the administration on the investment side? Kenneth Allan Lewis : That's something that gets looked at quite -- well I wouldn't say quite frequently, but certainly every couple of years here. And to date, the conclusion has been not to change that. Although every time we go through that exercise, we do identify ways we can improve our existing structure and systems and processes, which is -- that's a current discussion right now too. And that's part of the technology projects that I'm referencing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Two questions, really just kind of follow-ups from some of the things that I've heard. So just on the new 10b plan, is the assumption that I guess you guys put it in place because you weren't able to achieve your capital return goals previously and this may help that? Kenneth Allan Lewis : I think it's more that we thought we would have trouble meeting our goals in the future, and this would help that. It was just becoming more and more difficult to meet our goals, that's how I would characterize it. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then secondly, just shifting maybe to Global Bond, and I believe you guys touched on it a little bit so -- but just judging by the performance, which has been reasonably fine and obviously looks like it's gotten a little bit better here in April. What do you think has been the driver of the outflows? Because it feels like it isn't so much performance, maybe some of the headline stuff or macro stuff. I'm just curious what you guys' perspective is because it looks like it's performing reasonably fine. Gregory Eugene Johnson : Well, I would start with the global bonds kind of overshadows good stories underneath, and it's such a unique category. And I think it's fascinating that our 2 best-selling funds are global bonds right now. Last quarter, the Global Bond Fund, Global Total Return was #1 and 2 in gross sales. So there's still plenty of investors that want that exposure. It's just a -- I think it's just, again, a unique set of -- because you have shareholders throughout Europe that just have a whole different view and came into that with significant portions of their portfolio, that, that creates some near-term disruption. But it's also our best-performing area still and on a consistent basis over time. So I think that, when you have $4 billion in outflows in one quarter, that's going to overshadow a lot of stories underneath. So I think the other, as I've said before, I mean, Global Equity with Templeton, just the headwinds there by the dollar and the philosophy of not hedging, that's a pretty strong -- especially on like the Templeton Foreign Fund, creates some strong headwinds in the near term. So I think that that's another area that is somewhat unique. And then you take other areas, like I've talked about Mutual Series, why that has been a bit of a drag over the last few years but could be -- could turn around fairly quickly. And then areas where our deep value like our -- we've always had such strength with Rising Dividends Fund. In this kind of market that's more tech-oriented that's going to drag as well, that they tend to be more defensive funds. So some of the funds that we've led with have been a little bit more defensive in this type of market. Now we have growth funds, Franklin Growth Fund has very, a very strong track record across all periods. We're getting good flows there, but it kind of gets lost, I think, in the story. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Greg, just one question. Do you think, broadly speaking, fixed income investors are more willing to stick with the asset class in the past, despite the prospect of higher interest rates, because of the changing nature and the more expansive nature of fixed income investing? Gregory Eugene Johnson : Well, I think that remains to be seen. I mean, we really haven't had a significant rise. We've had a couple of blips on short term that have kind of moved back quickly. So I think there's always a market for fixed income. And the difference with fixed income is if rates go up, you attract new investors as they go up, and people that want to lock in liabilities and things, that creates demand in a down market for fixed income. So I think there's always -- there will always be a place for fixed income regardless if it's rising or not. I think the unconstrained question is one that we will see how that plays out and how those funds really do in a rising-rate environment. And we think our Global Bond Fund with negative duration will do very well in a rising-rate environment. That's what I said earlier. That's probably one of the catalysts to get increased flows back into that area. So I think there clearly is a concern on investors' parts for rising rates, and that's going to affect people going obviously into lower -- or longer-duration assets right now. But I think there's always clearly a place for fixed income. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a little bit of a modeling follow-up. Ken, as you look out into the next couple of quarters, can you give us an update of what you're going to have in terms of purging some of the dormant shareholder accounts? Kenneth Allan Lewis : Oh, yes. We don't -- yes, we probably won't know that till July. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's too soon. Okay. Kenneth Allan Lewis : That -- you're right, seasonally, that's when that happens. Operator : And it seems that we have no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Gregory Eugene Johnson : Well, thank you, everyone, for participating on our call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Kenneth Allan Lewis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Executives: Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Operator : Welcome to Franklin Resources' Earnings Commentary for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2015. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources, Inc, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. This commentary was pre-recorded. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello and thank you for joining today to discuss the third quarter results. I am Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. The current market environment with heightened concerns over volatility, currency exposure, fluctuating energy prices, and rising rates presents a number of challenges to investors. First, I'd like to share a few highlights for the quarter. Delivering strong investment performance for our clients remains our top priority and we're pleased to see that relative investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border fixed-income products remain strong with the percentage of assets in the top two quartiles increasing since March overall standard periods. The outperformance of our global fixed-income funds helped to ease redemption pressure on those funds resulting in lower outflows. The U.S. and cross-border Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies funds, which together attracted over $600 million in net flows for the quarter have been our fastest growing new fund launch in the history of the company. The cross-border fund is now available in 23 countries after launching in 14 new countries since March with 9 more in progress. Despite the current headwinds tempering flows we continue to deliver solid financial results and distribute excess capital to our shareholders. Operating income was up for the quarter at $770 million, a 2% increase despite flat revenue. And on the capital management front we've returned $1.4 billion to shareholders over the trailing 12 months through dividends and repurchases. We also continue to enhance our product offerings and during the quarter launched a new range of Retirement Payout funds for Defined Contribution participants. Our retirement planning has historically focused on asset accumulation. Products to optimize the distribution of those assets in retirement require further innovation so we designed these products to support the transition to this draw down phase. Turning to investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border funds on slide six, overall relative performance of our equity excluding hybrid and fixed-income strategies remained solid with the majority of assets ranked in the top half their peer groups. Of course, there are many ways to look at performance and asset-weighted view of peer performance is just one. In our 10-Q filing this morning we disclosed performance by investment objective against the benchmark and against peers. Looking at that view equity performance strengthened against passive benchmarks for the one-year, three-year and five-year period while having mixed results against peers, which was opposite of what we saw for the U.S taxable and tax-free fixed-income strategies. Underperformance of the Franklin Income Fund, which represents almost 30% of the assets in the equity and hybrid category, shown on slide six, weighed on aggregate performance for the one-year and three-year periods due to weakness in interest rate sensitive utilities, consumer discretionary and energy sector holdings. Although, the fund had a good start at the beginning of the quarter with strong absolute relative returns, the market pulled back across several equity sectors later in the quarter which led to a decline in relative performance. As noted, other equity-focused strategies have generally had good relative performance. The Mutual Global Discovery Fund, for example, outperformed its peer group across all periods as of June. On top of strong performance we have been working hard to promote this fund with new marketing materials highlighting our truly active management investment strategy and the consistent low-volatility track record. In general, I believe that as a firm we are well position for investment capability and strategy perspective particularly when interest rates began to normalize. Such an environment has traditionally correlated with the outperformance of value investing. Additionally, many of our fixed-income strategies have been defensively positioned in terms of duration for some time now. Assets under management ended the quarter at $867 billion, a decrease of about 1.5% since March. However, average assets under management increased slightly during the period. This divergence was due to the market pullback in June. The mix of assets under management by investment objective and sales region is consistent with what we recorded at the end of March as we generally experience only gradual changes in the mix from quarter-to-quarter. Net new outflows increased to $11 billion primarily the result of 19% decline in long-term sales which was felt across all investment objectives. Flows drove most of the decrease in lending assets as market depreciation was only about $2 billion this quarter. From a retail perspective, we faced continued headwinds during the quarter as a result of a confluence of market factors that impacted the short-term performance of several U.S. and SICAV flagship funds. In the past we have seen that it takes time for funds flows to recover following periods of short-term underperformance. Often we see a period of sharp redemptions followed by a period of slower sales which eventually recover and start driving improved organic growth. This quarter redemptions stabilized, but we did see a pronounced decline in sales particularly in some of our largest funds. In the current market climate a number of our flagship funds have been impacted at the same time. We are confident however that this is the part of a natural business cycle and believe the demand for these products will recover has investment strategies of our portfolio teams play out. In the meantime, we continue to keep advisors informed about the current positioning of the portfolios and the perspectives behind the portfolio managers' conviction. We also continue to look for opportunities to cross-sell and do enhance our product offerings. Also contributing to the overall decrease in sales this quarter was a drop in institutional business volumes as that segment snapped its streak of quarterly sales growth. While we did book a large funding for a global equity mandate, a handful of large redemptions resulted in net outflows in excess of $3 billion from global equity accounts while fixed-income strategies generated positive net sales. Clearly, this was a disappointing quarter from a gross sales perspective, but net flows of our institutional business are always impacted by the timing of individual mandates and redemptions as well as client interest, which we think remains very strong. Looking now at flows by investment objective, global equity flows declined this quarter due mostly to the institutional redemptions I just mentioned, but also because of the increased redemptions from the Templeton Asian Growth Fund. To the positive, we continue to see interest in European equity-oriented products managed by our Mutual Series team, including the Mutual Global Discovery Fund that had almost $300 million in net flows this quarter. Additionally, global fixed-income outflows improved a bit this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond and Total Return Funds continue to deliver strong out-performance versus their peers and benchmark. However, short-term absolute performance in broad market flows out of fixed-income due to fears of rising rates and market volatility, continue to pressure net flows. This has remained largely a retail channel phenomenon as institutional investors have not redeemed as heavily and net flows remain positive in that segment. U.S. equity outflows increased a bit this quarter, but we continue to see interest in a number of growth strategies, including the strong performing Small Cap Growth and DynaTech Funds. Hybrid flows turned negative this quarter due to outflows of about $1.6 billion from U.S. and cross-border versions of the Franklin Income Fund, due to the performance issues I discussed earlier. As I mentioned previously, our Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Funds generated over $600 million in net inflows and the cross-border version was among the best selling funds firm-wide this quarter. Taxable U.S. fixed-income slipped into outflows this quarter due to a large drop off in institutional sales as well as outflows from some high yield and government bond funds. Tax-free fixed-income funds also experienced outflows this quarter, though we did see continued interest in intermediate term strategies. I'd now like to turn it over to Ken to discuss operating results. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Greg. Overall, the quarter's financial results were strong. Stable revenues and disciplined expense management drove the growth in operating income, which increased to $770 million. However, the impact of non-operating items decreased net income to $504 million and diluted earnings per share to $0.82. Looking at revenues, investment management fees remained essentially unchanged at about $1.3 billion this quarter. Lower performance fees and a slightly lower daily average fee rate were essentially offset by the additional day in the quarter. Sales and distribution revenue was $567 million this quarter. Lower average non-U.S. assets and a decline in sales drove the decrease, but this was partially offset by a higher U.S. assets and the impact of a longer quarter. Shareholder servicing fees were about $67 million and were relatively unchanged over the prior quarter and other revenue was about $27 million due to the increased interest income from some consolidated products. Looking now at expenses on slide 18, sales and distribution expense was $694 million this quarter and the majority of this decrease was due to the changes in assets under management that also impacted sales and distribution revenue. Compensation and benefits expense decreased this quarter to $364 million, which was lower than I originally anticipated back in April, due mostly to lower variable compensation as well as a foreign exchange benefit of about $5 million. Based on where we are now, I continue to anticipate that the full year compensation expense will only increase by about 1% over 2014. Information systems and technology expense increased to $58 million this quarter. Although it's hard to predict the exact timing of these expenses, as I mentioned before, this expense tends to be higher in the fourth quarter due to the fact that some larger projects like software renewal and infrastructure development are typically finalized in the second half of our fiscal year. Investments in our security and communications infrastructure and desktop server and storage updates have driven these costs higher this year. And we continue to have a healthy pipeline for strategic projects that will enhance our fund administration, performance, risk and human resource management platforms. Due to these items, I now expect the full year expense to be in the range of 2.5% to 3% higher than fiscal year 2014. Occupancy expense decreased to $31 million this quarter, and general, administrative and other expense increased a bit to $85 million. Looking now at profitability, the operating margin increased to 38% for the fiscal year-to-date period and we remain focused on expense control in the current environment. The quarterly tax rate increased to 28.9% due to some prior quarter benefits that did not recur which brings the fiscal year-to-date rate to 29.2%. We continue to expect the fiscal year rate to be within the range of 29% to 30%. Other income net of non-controlling interest negatively impacted earnings this quarter by $28 million. By far, the biggest detractor was the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which resulted in realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses of $30 million. Interest expense increased to $13.7 million this quarter, while the rate of our 10-year notes issued in March was actually lower than that of the five-year notes that matured in May. There was a net increase in debt outstanding and we obviously only realized a partial quarter benefit from the maturity. Moving on to equity capital management, we repurchased 4.3 million shares during the quarter at a total cost of about $218 million, which represents an increase over the prior few quarters and was one of the highest quarterly levels in the past several years. In fact, open market repurchases increased 20% versus the prior quarter despite an 11% decrease in 10b-18 buyable trading volumes. As you can see on slide 23, over the course of the past year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders via repurchases and dividends, pushing the nominal payout ratio well above the 50% level which approximates our U.S. cash flow generation. Finally, we are pleased to see signs of increased bipartisan support for international corporate tax reform on the horizon which may include favorable repatriation provisions. With that, I'd like to conclude our comments. Thank you for listening.",

Please note the financial results to be presented in this commentary are preliminary. Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources\u2019 Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Hello. Thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO, and me today to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings. As we detailed in the recorded commentary earlier today, results were impacted by a number of converging market factors that created headwinds for performance and flows, particularly in our flagship funds. While it\u2019s still early, we are encouraged by the rebound in performance of the Franklin Income Fund and Templeton Global Bond Fund over the past month. Importantly, financial results were solid and we demonstrated strong capital management by accelerating share repurchases during the quarter.  We would now like to open it up for your questions. Q - Luke Montgomery : Good morning. Thank you. So last quarter you offered some commentary on gross sales trends being down. This quarter they weakened further and I think they\u2019re the lowest they\u2019ve been since the financial crisis. I guess a skeptic might wonder whether you stumbled into a sustained dry period for products that are going to get traction with the intermediaries. At the same time I think you are still very well diversified across product offerings. You got good salespeople and I think on the whole performance looks decent. So perhaps you could disabuse me of that skeptical view and tell me where you feel optimistic about products or categories that could pick up the baton and drive sales from here? Greg Johnson : Well, I think, first of all, I mean you have to look at the quarter and you had extreme volatility and you had headlines almost on a regular basis with one crisis after another. And for us some of those headlines directly affected our flagship fund. So you had the Ukraine with the global bond fund, you had Puerto Rico with Muni. So, I think it\u2019s hard to separate how much that combined with a very weak quarter for certainly emerging markets versus the developed markets and global markets in general, a lot of volatility. You\u2019d expect to see people kind of wait and see what happens. I think the area that we still see strength as far as a new product would be the K2 fund where we are close -- are now about $2 billion. We have raised about $600 million in net new flows for the quarter, so that would certainly be one. But I think the majority looking at the lineup and I would put mutual series in that category where it\u2019s focused on Europe and the U.S. and those were two of the best performing markets, put the mutual discovery fund in very good position in the global equity category, and we are seeing a lot of interest there. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any systemic kind of, or other than your two main funds have underperformed near term. They drive a lot of the flows and they tend to mask everything else. And then just the fear of the Fed raising rates that was there for the quarter and any fixed income fund was under pressure as well. So I think it\u2019s hard to get advisors to jump in when you have the uncertainty of these major events like the Fed raising or not to go into fixed income. Luke Montgomery : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then on the comp line, maybe I thought you could put some context around how you\u2019re driving that down, particularly as you think about year-to-date and projected fiscal first quarter profitability, how that\u2019s affecting bonus accruals for example. And then more generally, if you could comment on how you can manage comp with respect to market levels. Do you like to smooth it, or is it more pay to the environment? Ken Lewis : Sure. Yes. So comp this year was down 1% year-over-year. And a large part of that was based on the financial results of the Company and the revenue decline. That philosophy and our methodology for calculating the overall bonus pool, which is dependent on operating income, among other things, it will continue. So I would expect that to be in line with what we\u2019ve done historically. So as I mentioned, expenses for the year, we are looking to decrease expenses. We are also looking to make some investments. Last quarter I thought it would be flat. I think it will be a little bit better than that compensation is the largest expense that we have, so I would expect that to be down as well. Having said that, there is seasonality in many of these lines. The one thing I\u2019ll mention in comp is we do have merit, the increase is coming. We\u2019ll have about one month of that next quarter. So it should be a little bit higher on a quarter versus quarter basis should be a little bit higher than this quarter. Luke Montgomery : Thank you. Ken Lewis : Overall, I would expect it to be lower. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question. Michael Kim : Good morning. First, maybe just at a high level can you talk about potential exposure to assets managed for sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East? Just trying to get a sense of maybe risk of some attrition, assuming commodities pricing remains under pressure. And then related to that any sense of the relative fee rates versus the overall weighted average revenue yield for the firm? Ken Lewis : I\u2019ll take the first one. I think that you\u2019re exactly right. I think the attrition and reduction in some of the big sovereign wealth funds and we actually saw the effect of that this quarter where we had $1.4 billion out of one of the sovereign wealth funds and it was really just due to reallocation based on their exposure to Asia, having now a smaller pool of assets and it wasn\u2019t performance related. So there is some pressure there. I don\u2019t think there is anything I would call out beyond that. I think that was the one area where we had significant assets and it was a partial redemption of that account. But I don\u2019t have a number, nor do we publish a number, of our overall exposure there. But we haven\u2019t seen any other pressure that I\u2019m aware of for redemptions from the downsizing of those funds. Greg Johnson : Yes. And we have seen some a little bit of pressure in the effected fee rate. But I think that we don\u2019t expect that to continue in a material way, but we\u2019re still seeing some of that and that should bleed into next year as well. We would see the effective fee rate decrease a little bit next year, I would expect. Michael Kim : Okay. Fair enough. That\u2019s helpful. And then just given sort of the elevated fund outflows more recently, just any plans to maybe step up or adjust your marketing or sort of educational initiatives as it relates specifically to the global bond fund, just given the negative duration and relative returns of that portfolio, just to differentiate it, assuming rates, do start to trend higher at some point? Ken Lewis : Yes. I mean I think we have been very active in just that, getting the message out that this fund is positioned for higher rates. And it\u2019s difficult to get to every shareholder, but especially when you have large gatekeepers in places in Europe that control the big percentage of those accounts. So we have been very active in just that. The messaging that this is a very different category. But at the end of the day you probably do have a lot of people that bought it at a time when you had very high returns and in a lower return environment and also the competition from just equities doing better in Europe. As I said before, you will see monies move over. But you\u2019re still right. There is a perception of any fixed income fund that it will not do well in a rising rate environment, and our marketing message has been very clear about trying to differentiate that. And part of the reason we took that global macro group out of our fixed income group was better to differentiate what that group is doing versus a traditional fixed income fund. Michael Kim : Okay. And then just final question. Just trying to think about capital management. Clearly, you stepped up the share repurchases activity this quarter and you\u2019re now, I think, paying out more than 100% of the U.S. cash flow. But just trying to think about those dynamics within the context of a potential special dividend like you have done in the past? Greg Johnson : Right. You know, when we had the special dividend last year, I talked a little bit about it after the fact. And I mentioned that there is usually a very robust discussion of capital management by the Board during the Board December meeting. So I really can\u2019t say what they will decide in December. But I guess I remind you of last year. One of the factors they considered was the percentage of current year\u2019s or the previous year\u2019s net income that they return to shareholders. That number at the time was below 50% and this year it\u2019s almost 90%. So I think that would be a significant factor in the decision. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll decide, but I\u2019ll let you make your own assumptions about that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Ken, just on the capital management, one follow-up there. When you look at -- obviously the pace was very active this quarter. But even when you look going forward, the valuation is still -- you had this level when the Board kind of considers what those options are. Is that one of the driving factors? Are there a lot of other factors that go into that decision-making? Ken Lewis : Yes. I think I would -- I think that the factors that they consider are the regular dividend and the special dividend and the volume, the historical volume of share repurchases and the anticipated volume going forward based on stock price. So as we\u2019ve shown, we are opportunistic and we do tend to purchase more shares when the stock price is lower. But it is also systematic. And it is one of the things they would consider. Michael Carrier : Okay. And, Greg, just on the -- some of the flow dynamics. And not really focused on this quarter, because there is some crazy things going on, but when you think about maybe on like the structural side and you hinted at in like the VA space some shifts that are going on there. And then when I look at -- on the flip side some of the new products that you launch, whether it\u2019s K2 or some of the allocations in the international fixed income, maybe not this year but over the longer term, it seems like there is some structural drivers that are going in your direction despite some of these headwinds. So just wanted to get an update on where you see that demand? Maybe it\u2019s longer term that\u2019s driving some of the interests in these products versus -- you highlighted on that, like page 11 on the slides where from a cyclical standpoint you can see some pressure in shorter periods of time. So just basically how you\u2019re positioned for maybe the longer-term growth trends that you\u2019ve seen in the industry? Greg Johnson : I think our history has always been to try to be innovative, whether it\u2019s with pricing or new funds and do things that stand the test of time. So I think you\u2019re right. The VA, there is some lumpy activity that\u2019s hard to get a handle on what more of your operating flows -- to try to forecast and see where things are going because the VA business has been an important part of our U.S. retail. In the last quarter you had $3 billion of redemptions in -- for inactive firms that no longer support that business and it\u2019s in a runoff mode. And that\u2019s probably about a quarter of the firms that are in that business. So you\u2019ll still have some headwinds in that category continuing. They will probably be more one year event, but certainly challenging. I think as far as where the world is going and things that hopefully we\u2019re thinking long term about, as we\u2019ve said in probably the last two years\u2019 worth of calls, how we have continued to build and develop our solutions capabilities and building tactical asset allocation funds and multi-asset funds that are starting to get good records and good traction. And to us that capability enabled us to do something creative with Citi and our global footprint put us into a different position versus competitors to come out with a suite of funds for a new market for them, where they will go after it in more of a digital way for relatively smaller accounts. But I think having that product capability of doing more of the tactical and more funds that are more oriented towards a specific group that bring in all of the asset classes, I think that\u2019s very different than your traditional fund of just one class. And that\u2019s still going to be very important as advisors, to continue to build their own. But I think having the capability to do more tactical allocation will be increasingly important. I think that\u2019s the area that for us I think offers a lot of growth. I think the expansion in the alternatives, we\u2019ve seen the success and I think the early traction of our long/short of our -- the fund that\u2019s out there right now and then having a credit capability in there is another sleeve and we\u2019ll continue to build on that. So that\u2019s another area of growth. And then we have a new offering with a Flexible Alpha Bond Fund, which is another area of having more of a pure unconstrained bond fund like some of our competitors have that hopefully in a rising rate environment could do well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the insurance dynamic you mentioned on the prerecorded call. It seemed like some of it was associated with some de-risking from previous periods, but you also mentioned ongoing. So just trying to get a sense of what is your exposure to that channel and thinking about also more looking forward, is the DOL and some of the changes around disclosures and that, is that having any factor in some of these changes now, or is it more, as you highlight, de-risking? Greg Johnson : I think it\u2019s de-risking and just the guaranteed benefits and the liability and how they have thought about that as a business and some just have -- the insurance companies have gotten out of that and the companies like Hartford and Sun Life and Jackson National, big major firms are no longer doing that. So when they go inactive, some of them will lock in the liability. Some of them will go indexing or just do different things. So I think for us the total is about -- and I probably shouldn\u2019t even quote this off the top of my head but 17 billion remaining in that category. What percentage is at risk is probably -- I am not sure either there, but probably a third of that still, I would imagine, just based on looking at the numbers. Daniel Fannon : Great. And then the puts and takes around that institutional dynamic. You highlighted the win of 5 billion or so I guess. Greg Johnson : Right. Daniel Fannon : And then these ongoing redemptions. As you think about where else on the positive or negative side, you kind of see the kind of short to intermediate term kind of shaping up? Greg Johnson : Well, I think the win -- and that was in Japan with the pension client that funded in the first week of October at close to $5 billion and probably good news that it was relatively good timing to date on that category. And it\u2019s a very influential account that we think could -- we could see real momentum in that marketplace and even in the last year, some of the successes for the Company, and Japan would certainly be right up there with 3 billion in net inflows for the year and India with over 2 billion in net inflows for the year. So it really is a story around how these \u2013 the hybrid category with the income fund and the global bond category has been overshadowing a lot of activity underneath. And I think that\u2019s the key to flows getting the relative performance turned in those and the big drivers there are going to be energy, oil, and the emerging markets\u2019 currencies, are going to be the real game changers in near-term flows. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Worthington : Hi. Thank you. In terms of the kind of expense outlook for next year on the prepared remarks you talked about kind of 3% to 4% expense reduction. AUM has fallen much, much more from the peak. It\u2019s still kind of a challenging market and there is definitely performance issues. I guess why is 3% to 4% the right amount? What\u2019s kind of the pathway to get there? And I believe also in the prepared remarks you talked about that being offset by investment. I guess talk about the priorities from the investment front? Thanks. Ken Lewis : Sure. Well, we know that in this industry there is typically a lag in the revenue from the -- when maybe three, six, eight months from after asset general management declined. So the time we were doing our budgets, that was -- that seemed like 3% to 4% seemed like a reasonable target. And that, just to be clear, excludes selling and distribution expenses. So the reduction including selling and distribution expenses would be much higher than that. But a lot of that are things that we don\u2019t control. So I just wanted to exclude sales and distribution from the number when I gave it to you. Having said that, we are constantly looking at expenses, and we have -- we just have ongoing discussions about actions that we could take, actions that we might take, should revenues decline further. So it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not 3% and forget it. So we\u2019re constantly looking. And then there are things that we could do in the next fiscal year to reduce expenses further should we need to. But we want to be mindful and very thoughtful about where we cut expenses so that we don\u2019t \u2013 so that we don\u2019t hurt the business and impact our strategies in ways that we don\u2019t want. So that\u2019s the thinking there. Greg Johnson : And the \u2026 Ken Worthington : And what are -- are there any specifics you can share like how do you get to 3% to 4%, is it are you cutting comp or is there certain projects that can be delayed? Can you flesh out a little more how you get the 3 to 4? Greg Johnson : I think a lot of is it comp. I think it\u2019s a combination of everything that you said. And then -- and I think the 3% to 4% represented things that we could do and be confident that we could do in the short-term. We are looking at old initiatives, old business lines, and rationalizing them. Are the things still working? Do we still need the level of investment that we had? Can we repurpose those investments? But those are longer term and it would be premature for me to estimate what they might be in the future. So that\u2019s why I really didn\u2019t talk about them. But those are the things that we are looking at. And then, Ken, the second part of your question was initiatives. Things like smart beta we might want to invest in. There might be a systems improvement that we might want to do. And the caveat that I gave in my prepared remarks was they are there and we built in cushion to do that. But things get worse, we probably -- we might not do that. We will do smart beta for sure. Ken Lewis : And I think about the challenge is always the timing. I think the fact that you lost $100 billion in assets in one month, the budgeting process started long before that and it\u2019s hard to adjust real time to managing these groups. I think the point is that we recognize that there are headwinds out there. The market has been challenging. And we\u2019ve set our first goals out there quickly and we are going to review all aspects of the business to see if we can make more meaningful cuts than that percentage. But even 3% to 4% is meaningful when you take it in the context of you have merit increases, you have occupancy, all these things going up. It\u2019s actually more than 3% or 4% to really get your controllable down by that number. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you. For the follow-up, Greg, you mentioned a number of times some of the more recent investors and the Michael Hasenstab fund complex may be more susceptible to redeeming given the performance issues that the fund is working through, is it possible to kind of frame what the dollars you think are more susceptible? Like again, even if it\u2019s really vague, like that would be helpful. Is it $25 billion from here? Is it $50 billion, is it $100 billion? Like how much is, in your opinion, in that susceptible or at-risk bucket? Greg Johnson : Yes. I mean, I have no idea. I mean, you could take a wild guess there. But again it\u2019s going to be -- it\u2019s all relative to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and the fact is that that category, even on the three-year returns and five-year is much lower than where it was. So that makes just -- the point is you need absolute and relative performance to get momentum. And right now, it\u2019s competing with equity markets that have been much stronger over those longer periods and that\u2019s put pressure on them, and then also competing with the fear of rates going up. So my opinion, the markets change quickly; you can get a tailwind pretty quickly by what\u2019s happening in other sectors in the market and even a rise in interest rates. These funds will stand out clearly against a huge pool of capital that we could capture back in quickly. So, it\u2019s hard to guesstimate based on the current numbers. You had a very disruptive quarter there where the risk on trade -- risk off trade and movement back into treasuries and the euro versus emerging market currencies was exactly counter to how that fund was positioned for that period. You are going to have periods like that. And I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate that for the year going out, as far as what it to expect on redemptions. But I think it\u2019s something we try to factor in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Plead proceed with your question. Bill Katz : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. So Greg, using some of your slides from your presentation at page 11, you talk about the dynamic of growth versus value and being able to overcome that after a good crises. Strategically, how are you thinking about capital deployment? I appreciate the repurchase and when you were trading on enterprise value with the VA in particular, but just big picture? It sounds like there are pros and cons around the tactical flow dynamic. You\u2019re doing a nice job on expenses. But is there strategic urgency to broaden out the platform so we don\u2019t have to worry about whether the Dow is going up or not and put that in contrast? When it comes to BlackRock, trades at a substantial premium, I think the market says they can earn through and grow through almost any cycle, right? And for you it seems like you need a good value market to really drive flows looking at your own chart. So how do you think about maybe diversifying the franchise through acquisition to balance out some of that perception? Greg Johnson : I mean I think, Bill, you\u2019re right. Anything that we can do that creates a stronger platform for our distribution group, an all weather type platform for what\u2019s happening in the markets would be attractive. We are certainly open it to that. I think you\u2019re right. Any time you are facing headwinds in a lot of areas, that probability becomes greater. I would put that all in the category of us continuing like we always do, looking at every available company and meeting with as many as possible and trying to strengthen the line-up when it makes sense. So, yes, I would agree with that. Bill Katz : Okay. And then, Ken, you gave some nice color here on the expenses. Could you range it a little bit? If we were to be in a more bullish backdrop relative to expectations do the expenses come back quickly, or is there sort of appreciate the lag and the averaging AUM? How much flex do you have here to protect the margins if actually markets start to go up the other way? Is there sort of release some of the savings here and overspend if you will? I am trying to get a sense of the sensitivity. Ken Lewis : Yes. I think over the past maybe six or seven years we have gotten a way of increasing expenses wildly when the markets go up and then decreasing them. We have gotten a little more stable. Having said that, there is flex, and we do flex. I guess one way to think of it is in terms of new initiatives, there are things that we feel, okay, we must have that so we\u2019ll invest in that in any market. And then there are things that are nice to have, and those things, when times are a little tougher, we put them to the side and then when times get better we invest in them. But I think we\u2019ve been pretty good with keeping it somewhat range bound, the expense growth rate from year to year regardless of the market conditions. And then cutting them when we need to, obviously. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brennan Hawken : My first question is on quarter to date. You provided some color in beta helping out, which was helpful and gave us some color on some of the mandates you have won. Is there any way you can give us a look quarter to date at where you are as an organization as a whole as far as flows go? Greg Johnson : No. I mean, we really stay away from that. I think we have tried to just highlight any -- if we know something that\u2019s large and unusual, sometimes we will bring that up just so when the monthly numbers come out you have a better guesstimate on what\u2019s happening. But we really stay out of trying to forecast anything. Brennan Hawken : I recognize that. I was hoping given some of the remarkable unusual levels of volatility in the results maybe we could make an exception. Worth a shot. Next question is on performance stats that you give. And with the equity in hybrid numbers, if we stripped out the Franklin income fund from those figures where would the one-year, three-year, and five-year percentages stand on that slide 6 for you? Greg Johnson : Yes. It would look, obviously, very different. It would be -- if you take it out, it would -- it would look about 50/50 between those in the first, second, and third and fourth, but much stronger on the three-year, five-year, and ten-year. Actually, when you look at the large Franklin -- the Franklin growth fund, the Franklin U.S. opportunities, our core focus are all doing extremely well for all time periods and actually had positive flows. Those again get a little lost in the shuffle, but very good performance with the Franklin equity funds. I would call that as one of the few highlights for this quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris Harris : Thanks. I appreciate the outlook on slide 11 giving us a little bit of history as to what may happen going forward. And I guess that leads into my question. In your experience in the business, inflows and performance are trending this negatively, how long does it usually take for things to kind of normalize or come back? If we look at slide 11, the history would seem to suggest a couple of years. And I know it\u2019s driven by a variety of factors. Obviously performance and so on. But is that generally, you think, a reasonable base case? Are there other factors that could swing it wildly one way or the other? Greg Johnson : I think I mentioned the two that would swing it much faster. And I don\u2019t think there is a norm for when things turn. It\u2019s all what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and how are you positioned against where people think the market is going. And I think the two big drivers that roll up for us, if you look across our groups, would be energy. You know, where a lot of the value players did -- they didn\u2019t have heavy weightings going in, but they may be putting heavier weightings ins at the price is falling. And Templeton is one of those that has bought more energy. The high yield market with 20% of the index and the income fund having a heavier exposure. Anything that happens in the near term to oil is going to have a dramatic affect on that short-term performance, which then could, in turn, switch flows around fairly quickly. And it just -- it depends on what\u2019s happening in the rest of the markets, too. How quickly you\u2019ll accelerate that versus what the domestic market is doing, what the global markets are doing. Those are all factors. And it\u2019s just been -- for anybody in the global space, anybody in the value space, it\u2019s been a very tough run here for the last eight or nine years. Chris Harris : And then my follow-up question on smart beta. Sounds like you are, obviously, very interested in doing something there. Curious to get your thoughts whether this could be something that you would be building organically? Would you potentially acquire something? And then how would you distinguish a Franklin offering in what is a pretty crowded space already? Greg Johnson : We recognize all of that. I think I can\u2019t give many details on the -- what we intend to do there because we filed an exemptive order and haven\u2019t filed a registration statement. As we said before, we are looking at our own rules-based type ETFs but we can\u2019t go anything else. For us, it is a crowded marketplace, but having some low-cost beta with a little bit of -- hopefully a little alpha on top of that fits nicely into our own -- I talked about earlier the suite of solutions and having -- whether it\u2019s through our high net worth channel or through our own target date funds and things having our suite, it has a place just there today in existing products, and then how we expand into areas that we haven\u2019t had exposure to complement our traditional area where we see people, that would be attractive too.  And then again, as we\u2019ve said earlier, we look at everybody out there and if something gets us there faster or is complementary, we are open to doing an acquisition as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Hill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Hill : You\u2019ve seen some nice traction on the K2 products. I was wondering how you think about the investment there. Do you think that\u2019s mostly done on the platform and what the pipeline might look like going forward? And I also -- would you consider any other sort of small acquisitions potentially like an alternative manager to help that out? Greg Johnson : Yes so I mean I think the -- most of it is platform driven. It took a while. It took a few years to get a long enough record to get as we said, I think we mentioned that on prior calls that we\u2019re getting into the major broker dealers and on their platforms and getting approved. And that took three years and that\u2019s really why this year we\u2019ve really seen acceleration there along with the strong performance even in the protection of the downturn. It\u2019s done exactly what it should be doing. So it\u2019s been very attractive there. I think the other side is we have had much better kind of line of sight on what\u2019s happening in that space with K2 having relationships with so many different types of managers, and that may be something that we expand or take different stakes and different types of managers over time. And we\u2019ve had many introductions and discussions along there as well. So I think there is always a challenge to translate things to a pure liquid alts fund and that doesn\u2019t suit every type of alternative manager. And even these funds, it\u2019s a little bit different to meet that daily liquidity requirement.  So I think there are some constraints versus everything that\u2019s out there. Kenneth Hill : Okay. And then as a follow-up. The 60 million of unrealized losses you guys called out on investment on the prerecorded call; can you remind us again what types of investments you may hold there and then how we should think about that line here this quarter given some of the rebound on the market? Ken Lewis : Yes. I think the oversimplified easiest explanation is that the majority of the lines that -- the majority of the investments that are causing the volatility track pretty closely to the MSCI world index. If you kind of use that as a basis going forward, you would get closer than if you didn\u2019t do that I suppose would be a way to say that. Greg Johnson : It\u2019s where most of the volatility will be just in the seed capital in funds that have global equity exposure and emerging markets exposure. And then we have some investments in hedge funds that specialize in that as well. Kenneth Hill : Okay. Fair to assume some rebound based on what we have seen quarter-to-date thus far? Greg Johnson : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell : Thanks. Good morning folks. Greg, maybe if you could just -- I know it\u2019s tough to look at October in the near term here. But I guess over the next say one to two quarters as you think about the macro backdrop versus some of the performance track records and how to contrast that in terms of conversations that your sales force is having with financial advisors and also some of the conversations you are having with your institutional clients about -- and what\u2019s more important for flows near term? Is it -- do you feel it\u2019s closer tied to macro backdrop, whether we have rebound, of course, in emerging market and energy or do you think it\u2019s a little bit more about the relative performance in the funds versus peers? Greg Johnson : Well, I mean, again I don\u2019t know how I would answer that in any -- I think that it\u2019s a function of absolute both that the sales force has to paint a macro picture on why it makes sense. And that also helps retention. They need to do that. So I am not -- I think the story to me that\u2019s compelling on what turns it around is you have had such a run of the developed markets versus the emerging markets and the valuations are still -- are much more attractive, I think, in a lot of these other markets. And I think the currency kicker there -- to me, when I again take a step back and look at headwinds and look at what will turn things and the consensus that China will have a hard landing and that, that will affect the region at a time when you have already had currencies selling off at a level like the Asian financial crisis to me, that\u2019s the story for a global equities that the currencies are already at such a level that you should get appreciation there. The low level of currency should help those countries as far as their economies and while certain ones do have more of a direct hit from whatever happens in China, all of them don\u2019t and all of them have been affected.  And to me, that\u2019s the story that our sales force, I think, is out there talking about, that you can buy stocks at a cheaper value with better growth rates than what\u2019s available and developed, and also have I think the good potential for a currency. This has been pretty much an unprecedented run of the two against each other. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s good color. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on Greg, you talked a little bit about potential acquisitions down the road or just to fill out the product line. I guess does that require repatriation legislation, or do you think that\u2019s something you can still do without that? Greg Johnson : No. I think it\u2019s clearly something we can do without it. I think assuming you have no repatriation, or do you, it becomes more attractive to do something outside of the United States than inside for obvious reasons. We have a very strong balance sheet in the U.S. and have the capability, obviously, to do debt if we needed to do that. So it wouldn\u2019t keep us from doing anything anywhere I think at this stage. Brian Bedell : Okay Great. And then just a clarification on the 3% to 4% decline on expenses, Ken, is that net of investments or would investments dilute that? In other words, you get less -- Ken Lewis : Yes, net -- the investments would reduce that number. So the reduction would be less than 3% to 4%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Warren with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Gregory Warren : Yes, good morning, guys. Actually, I was a little pleased to see sort of the sales numbers on the equity side. They weren\u2019t as bad as what I had been projecting. So that looked pretty good from that perspective. I just want to touch base on something we\u2019ve talked about in the past and it\u2019s a positioning of your global international equity funds and the trouble you have had generating consistently positive flows for that business, but when you look at the performance relative to the index, the MSCI index, it\u2019s the not bad. I mean, over all time frames you are actually doing better than the index. It\u2019s just that when you are running up against the world stock category, Morningstar\u2019s category, you are actually trailing a bit. I am wondering, if you have taken a look at what\u2019s really differentiating you guys? Why is it that there is a spread between where you\u2019re performing and where the rest of the group is performing and whether or not that\u2019s something that can be addressed? Greg Johnson : Yes. I think that that is partly due to the history of not hedging with Templeton. And that\u2019s going to have some impact on how we do. And if you look at the risk you manage in a fund, some would say currency is close to half of that risk and we have chosen not to manage that risk. So that would be something I think we have spent a lot of time evaluating and plan to do some of that on some of our smaller funds to at least be able to compete, I think, more effectively and not have the dollar dictate what you\u2019re going to do relative to your peer group in the short run. Gregory Warren : Okay. And that\u2019s something you are working more closely with Michael Hasenstab platform on, correct? Greg Johnson : Correct. Gregory Warren : And then just a separate side note here. I mean, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s brought it up this period. We are getting closer and closer to that DOL ruling from the SEC. Do you do a lot of business in the advisory channel? I mean, I know from a commission based perspective a lot more money -- new money is flowing into no load funds, lower sort of fee structures, no commission based funds. But I am just curious on 12b-1 fees. What is your sense? What are you hearing as far as whether or not this is going to put a dagger in 12b-1 fees going forward? Greg Johnson : I think -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to put a dagger 12b-1. I think the question of how within the DOL proposal, how will any fees in the future for servicing and also the question of which products are approved. I think the point, we have less exposure than most in that sector. There has been heavy push back, I think, from some of the portions of the proposal and I think most of our comment letters around trying to create a class of approved shares, which would indicate, obviously, more indexing versus active. And hopefully that has been taken off the table. But like everyone in the industry, we\u2019re still very concerned with what the net effect of this will be. And if you take out any ability to pay for advice in the equation, the net effect is you are going to have less people getting help and that\u2019s certainly been the case in the U.K. and I think that\u2019s the case we raise with regulators here. But they are pretty determined and they have gotten a lot of good feedback from the industry and a lot of good feedback, hopefully, from the Hill. We will see where it ends up. Ken Lewis : But I haven\u2019t heard outside of that, on 12b-1 that would indicate that there is any future question of 12b-1 surviving or not. Gregory Warren : Yes. It just feels like there is a lot more unanswered questions right now than there are positive things we can latch onto. Thanks for your color. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question. Robert Lee : Thanks and good morning, I appreciate the patience. I apologize. You may have talked about this earlier in the call that I got on a little bit late. But, I\u2019m curious. You mentioned in the prerecorded comments and I think earlier in some of the Q&A, you talked about this new product rolling out globally with Citi. Can you maybe -- because you called it out, it seems you probably have pretty big expectations for it. Can you maybe explain a little bit -- in a little bit more detail what that is and why it\u2019s somewhat unique for you in strategy or structure? Greg Johnson : Well, I think it is unique. I think it speaks to the strength of our global footprint and working with some of the large financial institutions. This really is a new category. It\u2019s not an existing relationship with an advisor. It\u2019s really how does the bank address the smaller balances that are out there, but still significant, that wouldn\u2019t make sense for maybe a one-on-one advisor to service, but a way they can effectively offer products to help those people. To me -- and I wouldn\u2019t say the expectation is going to hugely move the needle for us in the next three years with what\u2019s raised here, but I think it\u2019s a point of the changing distribution landscape and how that the digital world is not just the traditional direct channel doing it or robo advisors or whatever you want to call it. It\u2019s also firms like Franklin Templeton that can go out and use the depth of our resources in building solutions and then going out and leveraging the relationships throughout the world. We\u2019re going to do this in Asia and Europe and the U.S. and in a cost efficient way, in a low-cost way, hit a new market. And I think this is, to me, an exciting first step in opening up the distribution landscape to do more of these types of things with -- whether it\u2019s with brokered dealers, partnerships, or who knows in the future where you do things direct to small accounts. It\u2019s just a first step. And I think an exciting one where we developed a new type of product that really has alternatives in it and has all the different categories within it, including we have lower passive cost funds in it, as well. It\u2019s not all Franklin Templeton in it. That, I think, gives it more credibility and hopefully can lead to a new market and significant sales over the long term. Robert Lee : Great. That was helpful. And maybe thinking more broadly about the distribution force, how should we -- or how are you thinking about -- I mean, you have a lot of strategies around the world. Some selling well. Some not so well. I mean, how are you trying to focus the sales force versus, there is defending franchises, such as equity income and global bond and maybe some of the others. And there is the new initiatives, whether it\u2019s K2 and the Citi initiative. But there is only a limited -- the pipe is only so big to put all this stuff through. So how are you trying to orient your sales force to -- what are they most focused on right now? Is it defending the franchise or this new stuff? How do you play one off against the other? Greg Johnson : I think you have to be consistent. We try to not -- I think it\u2019s a huge mistake to just go to where least resistance is in a sale. And we try to go out there and be consistent about our story and talk about where the obviously, if the client has X amount of assets in a given category, we better spend our time talking about that. If we didn\u2019t do that, and I think our sales force has been around long enough to know that you are going to lose that relationship and credibility pretty quick if you are not talking about the areas where you are having underperformance. So, yes, I mean, a big part of it is focusing on retention and really also painting a picture of why these things should turn around. And I think that\u2019s what you have to spend your time on. But also always have something that is in the channel that\u2019s exciting that they can talk about. That\u2019s also adding value and always having something new, whether it\u2019s K2, whether it\u2019s a Flexible Alpha Bond Fund, or a Franklin Growth Fund. Those are things you want to talk about. So I think it\u2019s always a balance of the two, and we\u2019re very careful about -- and watch very closely on all presentations that are made in the field to make sure that they are focusing on where the assets are first. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Eric Berg : Thanks very much. As you think about -- well, first, let me say I appreciate the heads up at the beginning of your comments encouraging us to take a look at the videos on your Investor Relations site. I will do that because it will help me understand further the answer I am looking for. Here is my question. As you think about the nuances of the investment style and approach of the folks running the Franklin income fund and Michael Hasenstab\u2019s group, other than currency, which you just mentioned a moment ago, are there other dimensions to their investment, let\u2019s call it personality, that has caused their underperformance? Because after all everyone -- they have got a lot, large group of peers. Everyone is looking at the same oil price, the same collapse in commodity prices, broadly the same depreciation in emerging market currencies. So what is it about his style or her style that is causing them to be where they are right now? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean I think, first of all, you take each category and go back a year or six months ago, you\u2019d have top decile for every period. If you have top decile for every period, you are taking more risk generally than many that would manage closer to the index. And we\u2019ve always said this is a very unconstrained approach. And any time an act -- a real active manager will underperform and grossly underperform in certain markets. You don\u2019t -- you\u2019re never top one, three, and five every period if you are a true active manager and really don\u2019t worry about being that different from the benchmark. Take the Franklin Income Fund for example. It\u2019s the highest yielding fund in its category. We know it underperformed generally when rates go up because we will always have more duration in that fund and everything held equal in the short run, that will happen. He can do some tweaking around that but people buy it for the stability of that higher income and it truly is a hybrid, not a pure equity fund. So the peer group even gets a little bit confusing. I don\u2019t think the energy -- and it\u2019s not the first person to buy a fixed income in that category and one that we feel like there hasn\u2019t been a lot of differentiation within the group and that there are still are many companies at the prices today are going to do fine. You\u2019re paying debt first that\u2019s the main thing and many of these can service a debt. Now, there has been some that have obviously not done as well through this period. But it\u2019s an active bet and active bets in the short run can make you look kind of silly. And that\u2019s the nature of being a true active manager. So I don\u2019t think anything has changed. I think you just have two that have headwinds at the same time. And again, the long-term performance still looks good. Clearly in the global bond case, I mean this can turn around in a couple of weeks as far as the short-term numbers. Eric Berg : Thank you. And my second and final question relates to variable annuities. It\u2019s sort of a similar question to my first one. Is there any reason why Franklin Templeton should be affected more than others by this pull back from variable annuities by some life insurance companies? Greg Johnson : I don\u2019t think we are being, I think there\u2019s other ones that are private companies and others that have significant assets and that probably the two, three biggest firms in this category, two out of the three are private. So you are not -- you don\u2019t hear about them. But everybody is equally being affected by them getting out of that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Last one I guess on capital measurement again. Can you talk a little bit more on I guess your ability to continue paying out over 100% of free cash flows generated in the U.S., and I guess more importantly the willingness to lever up to buy back more stock to maintain the total payout at current levels? Thanks. Greg Johnson : Yes. Sure. I think that -- yes, that\u2019s a great observation obviously that can\u2019t go on forever. But we do have flexibility. So we have short-term flexibility where we have inter-company borrowings that we can do. We have the ability for debt. And if we feel the need to do it, as we\u2019ve shown in the past, we will increase the leverage of the Company. But I think what drives it is us being opportunistic when we feel like there\u2019s opportunities to buy the stock at a good price. And then from there, all the other decisions flow. So I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s restricted really. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cyprys : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on some of your earlier commentary on M&A. Just curious in terms of how you are thinking about prioritizing what products could make the most sense to add in terms of rounding out the products there? And then just more broadly, what are some of the criteria you have when it comes to M&A? Greg Johnson : Well, I would say that -- I mean, we\u2019ve talked about some of the areas would be in the alternative space of something made sense there in the high net worth space if something made sense there. We talked about that in the past. I think whether there was a large scale manager outside of the U.S. that was complementary and could get some synergies out of that would be interesting for us as well. And I think something on the institutional lower cost side that we could leverage through the retirement channel here would be interesting as well. So those would be a few. But I think we, as always, we try to look at pretty much everything, try to get a better sense of value and what\u2019s out there. So I wouldn\u2019t preclude anything. But as far as a wish list, those would be the ones that we would -- you could have an international manager without a U.S. distribution, which could be complementary. Those are the kind of things we would look for. I think -- and obviously, like anybody looking at this space, you want something that has a strong repeatable process with consistent results over time and the right kind of culture that can fit in and the right kind of incentives by doing it. And that\u2019s where I think, as we\u2019ve said in the past, just going out and buying hedge funds or alternative managers can be somewhat challenging as it\u2019s hard to align the right incentives after somebody who is solely responsible for the results is selling most of their upside in that deal. So that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t really done many of these types of acquisitions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question for today comes from the line of Bruce Bohannon with IBM. Please proceed with your question. Bruce Bohannon : Thank you, gentlemen. I pushed the button too early. But thanks for letting me in. You announced earlier that there were some management transitions that recently occurred. I just wanted level set and understand Mr. Johnson, Greg, are you short-term, intermediate term, are you still on fire for this Company? I think it\u2019s an incredible Company. I saw a rumor that you may have been retired on October 1st, which is obviously not true because you\u2019re here. Please and thank you. Greg Johnson : I hope not. You know, I am absolutely long term and I think that this -- the fire burns probably too much every day for me. But this was in no way I think this was recognition of two people that have been here for a long time and we think make -- we really think makes us a stronger organization. Just the demands on travel time and this helps me, I think, organize in a way where we can better use our strengths in the Company and Vijay and Jenny bring a fresh energy and perspective. I think also the realignment of our executive committee, now having three of our senior investment people, is something that I think is very important for the Firm going forward and really bridges the gap between the management guys and the investment guys and puts us all together as one team. So in no way should it indicate and I hope that\u2019s good news, me having any change. But we are excited about these changes, and I really do think it\u2019s going to put us in a much stronger position to address the areas that need to be addressed. Operator : Thank you. Gentlemen, we do have one final question coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Siegenthaler, your line is live. I am sorry, that seems to be our final question. I will turn the call back to Mr. Johnson for any final remarks. Greg Johnson : Thank you again for everyone participating on our call and we hope we have some better news next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect line at this time thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. You may now begin. Greg Johnson : Well, good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me today to discuss first quarter earnings. Although we faced a number of headwinds impacting investment performance and flows, we\u2019ve been through periods like this before. And it\u2019s one of the reasons we value diversification and a strong balance sheet. As we work through these challenges, and maintain our focus on expense management, we will continue to invest in a number of long-term growth opportunities, including strategic beta ETF, liquid alternatives and related solutions while delivering our value-added services to a growing customer base around the world. And now, Ken and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : All right, thanks guys. Greg, maybe first one for you, just on the flows in the quarter and the outlook, you hit a few things on the pre-recorded call. But it sounds like the institutional business continues to gain some traction. So just wanted to get an update on maybe the pipeline and what you\u2019re seeing on that front. And particularly given maybe some of the pressures in the market in where institutions are looking to put some money? And then on the retail side, it seems like the pressure on Franklin income and Global Bond, it has been out there, it seems like there is more outreach to the client base, and just any kind of reaction to that? Greg Johnson : Normal searches with Global Ag and global equities. I think of note, and what has happened over the last say three to six months, some of the pressure on global currencies, affecting various countries and then looking for those countries to diversify, I think we\u2019re seeing more opportunities in the Global Bond space in Asia right now, as those currencies have been hit and with further risk of some going down to diversify away from their local currency. I think anytime you have periods where you face challenges and headwinds in performance, certainly a risk-off environment that any income funds that have heavy - high-yield exposure are going to be under pressure. And we just want to make sure we communicate the value and really the appropriate kind of understanding of risk in those funds. And when you get the kind of spreads that you have today, from treasury, as you do have room for even some defaults and those and still continue to do very well against treasury. We think the markets have been under stress certainly in these areas as expected, Franklin Income Fund affects any high-yield funds like our high-income fund. And we just want to make sure that we continue to get as much information out there and hand-holding to help advisors deal with their clients right now. Michael Carrier : All right, thanks. When you hit on the institutional question, I don\u2019t know, my phone wasn\u2019t working I didn\u2019t hear the start of that. So, I didn\u2019t know if you mentioned anything on the pipeline? Greg Johnson : Well, I think, I would say the pipeline, the opportunities in the pipeline would be more global bond opportunities like the win that we had in Asia over the quarter, we\u2019re just seeing more interest whether it\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Funds or government entities in diversifying from their own currencies that are under pressure right now. Michael Carrier : Okay, got it, and then Ken, just a quick one for you. Given the pace of the buybacks, just wanted to see if you can give us an update on maybe the U.S. versus the non-U.S. cash balance. And just given the level of cash flow you\u2019re generating what\u2019s the outlook on buybacks? Ken Lewis : Sure. So, the buyback activity is in relative to history, it\u2019s been pretty elevated last two quarters. And I could essentially say that U.S. cash has remained unchanged. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s remained unchanged year-over-year as well. So, we\u2019ve been having plenty of U.S. cash generation to cover our needs. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, good morning. I just want to follow-up on the Weddell news yesterday because you guys also have a high composition of A-class mutual funds. So, I\u2019m just wondering, do you have any load waved A-s that currently sit in fee-based accounts? Greg Johnson : Yes, we do. And that\u2019s been a growing portion of our sales as more advisors have gone to the wrap advisory fee accounts. Craig Siegenthaler : Do you see need in the future of those transitioning from a low-wave A to I-class or is your rev-share less? Greg Johnson : I don\u2019t, I mean I think part of the reaction I don\u2019t want to speak for Weddell. But for us, remains to be seen on the fiduciary rule which we have I think - we\u2019re expecting something out in 90 days on that. But we don\u2019t think it would affect our existing A-shares in any way. And if, there are different rules around use of those in advisory programs, we already the no 12b-1 class available. So it would be easy. It\u2019s really, I mean, for us, it\u2019s up to the broker dealers and advisors to interpret those rules to best fit their business models, but I think we would have all the share classes and we do that right now. Craig Siegenthaler : And then, I don\u2019t know if you have this number handy, but if I look at your U.S. mutual fund business, do you have the mix that sits in fee based accounts and the mix that sits in commission based accounts? Greg Johnson : I don\u2019t right now. I think the, I just looked at the number, on the top of my head, it said right now we have about 40% of sales going into the no 12b-1 share class. And that\u2019s grown from 30% in the prior year. I would still say that our A-share count is higher with the 12b-1 just due to our distribution model and our strong partnership with Edward Jones that still favors that class. Ken Lewis : And can I just add that it does also vary by fund on that mix. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay, thanks, I appreciate guys taking the questions, good morning. Ken, I\u2019ll start with you, you\u2019ve given a little bit of expense updated expense guidance in the pre-recorded call, I appreciate that. Could you talk a little bit about I guess some disclosure was given through the 10-Q. Some of the disclosure, where the severance is occurring and if the markets, and what are your underlying assumptions for markets with this guidance and I guess the markets would have continued to still work themselves lower. What kind of incremental flexibility would you have to try and protect margins? Ken Lewis : Well, I think, regarding where the expenses been incurred, I think geographically maybe the majority of the expense is U.S. based. Across business lines, it hasn\u2019t, we haven\u2019t really impacted the investment management sector of our business. It\u2019s been spread out pretty much across the board other than investment management. So, the assumptions regarding, we talked about a target of 3% to 4%, and that was few months ago. What this market volatility has led us to conclude is that we should just be looking at all of our business and seeing where we can increase efficiencies, leverage efficiencies and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and that\u2019s going to be a theme for probably the next nine months. And that\u2019s just based on the volatility we\u2019re not assuming that market is going to go up or down. But it\u2019s obvious to let that volatile so we need to be looking at our expenses closely. Bill Katz : So, is there, if the markets were, just to clarify, if the markets were to sort of continue to work their way lower away from volatility, so down returning for the short-term, could you, is there more levers to pull to sort of protect the margin? Ken Lewis : Well, we think there are more levers to pull but as I said, it\u2019s just - we\u2019re looking at the entire business almost without regard to the markets. So it\u2019s just an opportunity for us to make sure that initiatives that we started years ago, we still believe in investing things that we believe in now, and just try to kind of reengineer all of our processes. Bill Katz : Got you. And just to follow-up to Craig\u2019s question, your thoughts here. Your very big picture, you\u2019re doing a nice job in some of these ancillary businesses, K2 continues to grow, you\u2019re sort of investing in I guess smart data portfolios. But when you step back and look at your portfolio, you do have a lot of relatively sizeable flagship retail funds with some choppy sort of short intermediate term performance. What measures are you taking to try and protect those assets particularly in the retail channel? And then, sort of corollary, any thoughts of maybe ramping up the marketing spend, or was that just sort of wasted dollars as given the backdrop with the only way down? Greg Johnson : I think it\u2019s a good question, and one that was really performance driven like anything in this business. And we\u2019re on our 10th year now of growth outperforming value. And you kind of look for a glimmer of light out there hope. And certainly in January, it\u2019s been very choppy market value did outperform growth for the first time. So I mean that would be the kind of the key driver to get more attention to some of these flagship funds that have been lagging. And we looked at some of the big laggers that have been in January, made some ground, back with rising dividends, mutual shares and mutual quests had a very strong January. So I think if that trend continues, that would be important. I think the other part, as Ken said is really looking at our entire business and validating everything we\u2019re doing. And I think part of the changing distribution landscape advisors, looking at our industry and what they need differently, I think if you have redundancy with certain funds or it\u2019s just not clear, what that fund offers in various categories that advisors need, we may need to tune some of the line-up or merge some of the line-up. And that\u2019s something that we really are looking at now. And that can drive some cost savings ultimately longer-term as well. Bill Katz : All right, thank you guys. Greg Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Kim, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Michael Kim : Hi, guys, good morning. So, first, Greg, on the pre-recorded call, you highlighted some initiatives to better position the institutional business by building out some infrastructure optimizing the product line-up. You also alluded to pricing. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of how you might be thinking about either the level or structural fees in that channel and just kind of the potential impact from an economic standpoint as you move through that process. Greg Johnson : I think that\u2019s always a challenge on the pricing side especially when you have funds in the marketplace and sensitivity to making sure we have consistent pricing across. I think the comment was just more on some of the development that we\u2019ve been doing also with the Smart beta ETF as I said before, I mean, I think that allows us to get some lower cost vehicles out there that have market beta at a much lower cost. And that\u2019s going to be attractive to certain institutions as well as within our solutions and outcome group. But I think the, I don\u2019t think there is anything really to call out on the pricing side that we look at, I think we continue to study the markets and try to be competitive. And then we all know the pressure on lower fees continues. And we\u2019re trying to meet that or develop new capabilities that don\u2019t conflict with some of the retail styles that we can build-out capabilities. Michael Kim : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then also on last quarter\u2019s call, I think you mentioned about a third of the $17 billion in sort of the sub-advisory variable annuity channel was at risk. So, just following sort of the $5 billion redemption last quarter, does that suggest that sort of related AUM at risk from here is the minimums or immaterial at this point? Greg Johnson : I think there is still probably another $5 billion at risk right now with one of them, but, and from there, I think we have today low 40s, $42 billion in those sub-advised assets, that\u2019s 6% of our base. And I think of risk, I\u2019d put another $5 billion for the changes that are taking place in that market. Hopefully the other side of that is we are because of build-out we have with our solutions group and some of the development, and we just got our first mandate of managed volatility fund, so that is an area that hopefully we can more than make up the loss of the $5 billion coming up. Michael Kim : Got it, okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, just first simply on the new marketing materials that you gave out on Global Bond and the Income Fund. When was that rolled out and then you said in the prepared remarks that there was good engagement and interest by clients. What does that really mean? Are you actually seeing any indication that redemptions are slowing or sales are increasing? Thank you. Greg Johnson : I think we rolled it out right around the end of the year, around January 1. So, early to quantify any behavioral changes there. I think what we\u2019re trying to do is get the tools in the advisors\u2019 hands so they can quickly sit down with their clients and walk them through logic on why you would stay put in a period where there is a lot of headlines around high-yield and stress and liquidity and make sure that they have a broad understanding of what is going on with those funds. I think the other point I would make just around, because I think that\u2019s the question I would look at is when would, you see your flagship flows returning. And I think when I look at the income fund, its long history and it is a well-diversified portfolio. But it\u2019s always one that doesn\u2019t fit neatly in any category. It will always have high-yield exposure and it will always be the, what the highest yielding in its category. So, it would be naturally a little bit more risky than its peer group. So you will expect to have periods where it lags performance. I think the other side of fixed income I\u2019ve said before, when the market settle and high-yield settles, and you\u2019ll have very attractive spreads to what certainly treasuries are today. And you\u2019ll have a 6 plus yield on a fund that\u2019s done very well long-term. I think it\u2019s very easy to get momentum back in flows, little bit easier than an equity fund that just the attractiveness of that coupon and the history. And that\u2019s where I would expect to see a turn. So, I think it\u2019s really just when the market settle, when the high-yield bond market settles in, I would expect to see that fund start to get lower redemptions and hopefully better sales. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you. And then on the, I guess from now $5.5 billion mandate which I believe all that funded this quarter. There was the initial amount then there was like a stub piece that was added. What is the potential here for more money being mandated from this investor? It would seem like there is a lot of money out there, change in strategy, I guess my erroneous view is that that was kind of a one-time thing. But does this have the potential to be the gift that keeps on giving here for couple of years? Greg Johnson : Yes, and I think not only that, that relationship but other institutional mandates in that market as well. And it\u2019s a high-profile relationship there that gives us better visibility in that market. So, hopefully we can extend that into a few more relationships. But it\u2019s one that we hope we\u2019ll grow. Ken Worthington : Okay, awesome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hill of Barclays. Please go ahead. Ken Hill : Hi, good morning guys. Greg Johnson : Good morning. Ken Lewis : Hello. Ken Hill : In the pre-recorded comments you mentioned a new head of global ETFs and then the registration of the strategic beta ETFs. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you\u2019re looking to package those with some of your active products and what you\u2019re hearing from clients, maybe the demand for it ahead of a launch like that? Greg Johnson : Well, I think the need whether we use someone else\u2019s ETF or our own between, in our own line-up we know we have the need for lower cost beta in outcome oriented or solutions type products. So that\u2019s something that we feel we have an immediate place for those ETFs. And then, I think it will take more time and marketing to develop more presence and probably a broader line-up. But it\u2019s just our first step into the ones that we think, internally, we don\u2019t have to go out and use somebody else\u2019s ETF, we can use these and that there is some demand from the retail channel as well. I wouldn\u2019t try to quantify that right now but enough immediately to make it meaningful to us. Ken Hill : Okay. And then last quarter you guys spoke about potential acquisitions. Just wondering how the thought process there might have evolved, given how you look at repurchases and capital returns with the stock price and then also the value of other companies you might be looking to purchase there to fill in perceived gaps maybe. Does that look better or worse than it did last quarter and how are you thinking about that for the course of the year? Greg Johnson : I wouldn\u2019t, I think it is unchanged, kind of the strategy, how we look at M&A, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed. I don\u2019t think the level of repurchases changes that. As we always say, and we say we\u2019re opportunistic, one of the facts is the share price and the market. But the other factor is what are the uses of cash, if we were identify a target then we would probably scout back on the repurchases to balance it out. But, we continue to look for opportunities in M&A and that hasn\u2019t changed. Ken Lewis : And I would say from my perspective, it\u2019s more probable just based on what\u2019s happened in the marketplace. Unfortunately we\u2019ve been sitting with a lot of cash and that puts you in a unique position. And I think with the sell-off and a lot of asset managers and the sell-off in currencies around the globe, the potential for doing something I think is a lot more attractive today, just looking at currency moves around the globe than it was before. So, we are actively out there and are hopeful that something will come that enhances the line-up and adds value long-term. Ken Hill : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks; good morning. Ken, I guess a couple of specific modeling items. The G&A you mentioned on the pre-recorded call, there was a one-time item that boosted it. If you could give us a sense of what the starting point is normalized going forward? Ken Lewis : Yes, I think we would expect that line to be more like it was in 2015 on a quarterly basis than what it was this quarter. Maybe that implies I don\u2019t know the exact number of the item but probably in the neighborhood of $10 million. Dan Fannon : Okay. And then just to follow-up on the last comment on M&A. Can you talk about some of the things you find interesting, whether it be from a product perspective, geography or is it just scale? Like how do we think about what you view as realistic in terms of adding to your existing suite of products? Greg Johnson : I think it\u2019s really all the above, I mean, it could be a large scale that you get efficiencies from distribution and servicing, it could be parts expanding the high net-worth business, it could be the solutions\u2019 outcome, it could be real-estate, I mean, it\u2019s a lot of areas that we\u2019re looking at. But I think the probability of the rate situation offshore, even with Asia type funds that are very much at a favor right now I think would look attractive for us long-term. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Greg Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Yes, hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on the comments you made about the, I think you said 40% of the sales are in I-class and the rest carry some kind of distribution. With those that carry distribution, do you happen to have visibility into what portion is in retirement accounts at this point? Greg Johnson : No, I don\u2019t have that number. And obviously that\u2019s the relevant one as far as the potential with the fiduciary rule. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Greg Johnson : We can certainly get that for you. Brennan Hawken : That would be great. Any additional, I know in the last quarter\u2019s call you were asked on DOL and at that point it didn\u2019t seem like you wanted to make many comments, given it is not final. But now that we have the rule in OMB, right? So, we\u2019re a couple months, at most, away from final and it\u2019s expected to be largely unchanged. Do you have any sense of the extent to which this might impact your AUM, rather, through the broker-sold channel? Greg Johnson : No, I think it\u2019s still too early. And I don\u2019t think it has an immediate impact, I think what it does is, it has an impact on your future sales in those markets. And I think you\u2019re absolutely right in every indication, despite record comments and concerns raised, it\u2019s something that looks like it\u2019s going to move pretty quickly and try to be enacted before next January. And whether that results in lawsuits, I think that\u2019s still very much out there as a possibility to take this up. But we are going to work with our partners and try to work through what will be a very complex transition to deal with this new rule. But again, I couldn\u2019t quantify what that means other than it\u2019s not a positive. Brennan Hawken : Sure. Yes. No doubt it is going to be difficult. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Thanks. Good morning, folks, just a little bit more on the strategic beta initiative. I mean, first, how substantial or how, what kind of breadth of product do you want to ultimately develop in this area? And then if you can talk a little bit about the distribution game plan for the products and also is this partly in response to potential DOL with these products, they obviously become more attractive in a DOL or in a kind of fiduciary rules? Greg Johnson : No, I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in response to the DOL world, I think it\u2019s just in response to where we see growth and needs in our line-up. Again, as I said before just getting a cheaper beta that doesn\u2019t conflict with your other funds will be important for us. I think the question on how big this market and whether or not at some point there is a vehicle that makes it more efficient than you typical 40-act and transfer agent type driven product, I think those are all questions that are still very much out there. So, we just felt like the business is too large for an asset management company to ignore and whether it\u2019s again through acquisitions or organic growth, that\u2019s going to affect our plan on how we roll this out. We think it has to be a separate effort but also part of - you get the leverage from your existing wholesaler group as well. And how big, I think again, I think we\u2019re starting kind of small but we will continue to roll-out or acquire new ones as we see fit, it\u2019s just kind of getting that space and building a team there and growing it. Brian Bedell : Is there any desire to develop actively-managed nontransparent ETFs, you have obviously a number of applications in the SEC for that to de-leverage your own investment management products? Greg Johnson : I think that\u2019s a possibility that we are looking at. So, I think that like everyone we\u2019re studying that and it is certainly a possibility to do that if you get the right regulatory relief on that and if it makes sense in that specific vehicle. It\u2019s something we certainly would consider because there are efficiencies you can gain. Brian Bedell : And then just lastly on the, question for you, Ken, on the costs, obviously if you - regarding the flexibility, if we are in a longer term difficult market environment, does it cause you to look at the out-sourcing of fund accounting, administration and back office as one of those potential longer term cost saves versus maybe looking at more deeply at the investment management segment of the business? Ken Lewis : Yes, so, and I think I\u2019ve mentioned, we talked about this subject before. That topic regardless of market conditions has come up over the years. And we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis on it. But so, I wouldn\u2019t say, I think that market volatility as I mentioned causes to just look at our entire business, all the business processes, all the business lines and rationalize everything. And I would include outsourcing of any type. Brian Bedell : You would include that? Ken Lewis : I would include that, yes. We would look at that again. Brian Bedell : Okay. And yes, that\u2019s a little bit of a change from you guys, I think, have been more steadfast on keeping that in-house in the past. Is that sort of, little bit of a change in view or was it always something you\u2019re considering? Greg Johnson : Well, I think it\u2019s not a change of view to look at it the conclusion may or may not be different this time. There are very valid reasons for us to do some of these things in-house, some of - our business is very, customized and very difficult to outsource everything. So, I don\u2019t know that philosophically we\u2019ve changed what we think is important to our customers and our business but we will look at it. Ken Lewis : And I would just add, I mean, again, in any environment this is something that we would look at. And because of our structure and capabilities in lower cost regions like India, we\u2019re very, cost competitive to the market in those services. If we were not, then that\u2019s something that we have to consider. So those groups know that that\u2019s something they need to validate, they need to press cost down and they\u2019ve done that effectively. So it really hasn\u2019t given us a reason to go out and outsource it. Brian Bedell : Right, understood. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions, going back to the M&A question, I\u2019m just curious. A couple of your peers have done some acquisitions and I guess I\u2019ll call it the FinTex space, so whether you want to call it Robo Advisors or something else, and I was just curious, your thoughts about maybe not those specifically, but kind of your thoughts of opportunities to enhance or strategically position your business with acquisitions that maybe we wouldn\u2019t normally think about for you guys. Greg Johnson : Well, I think certainly the industry is exploring that space. And looking at lower cost alternatives, it can reach broader groups through digital marketing and the capabilities that exist trying to get to the millennial in a different way than the traditional broker-dealer advisor model. So, for us, that\u2019s another one that with the FinTex space and looking at Robo Advisors is something we certainly are studying whether or not we need to go acquire one or to build that capability, I think that\u2019s a question that we\u2019re looking at today. And I think the opportunity for the industry as distribution landscape changes, as we go to more advisory driven models as in traditional barriers between a broker-dealer funds sold group versus a direct group, continue to erode and disappear at a pretty quick pace. I think the opportunity is what does that mean, for investment management firms. And I think that\u2019s why a lot of groups are looking at. And for us, I mentioned, the partnership that we\u2019re doing with a large global bank and using our solutions capabilities targeting the emerging affluent market through digital marketing to existing customers in the bank. And that\u2019s very similar to what a Robo Advisor can do. And these are funds that are multi-asset and have a lot of different, they have other managers than Franklin Templeton in them and we can do that. So, that\u2019s somewhat of what a Robo Advisor can deliver. And to me, there is not a lot of magic there to what a Robo Advisor can do versus a solutions group can do or anybody modeling out. And I think the direct space, the Vanguards and the traditional people in that space or swab have a pretty good head-start of dealing with them in a marketplace as far as Robo Advisors. Robert Lee : Okay, great. And then, maybe just one follow-up, just trying to, the macro business which I guess is housed within the Global Bond business. I mean, that\u2019s a place you got that big mandate, hopefully more, you kind of talked about as a place of success. I\u2019m just kind of curious, could you kind of size maybe how big that book of business is? And kind of give us a feel for, in addition to this $5 billion-plus mandate, kind of the growth trajectory of that? Greg Johnson : Well, no, I mean, it would be very difficult. I think it\u2019s still well it\u2019s called a global macro mandate from that group. It\u2019s really more aligned with your traditional global bond. It has a separate account. And I think the opportunity we still feel is a significant one. And I think there has just been some recent pressures around global currencies and a short-term lag in performance but we still feel that\u2019s kind of a pure alternative category to rates rising or equity markets dropping that it really does provide a nice cushion to a portfolio. So, we think it\u2019s still, it has a very large potential in a market. And I think like last time, when did it do well, it did well when the equity market sold off and other markets were under pressure. And it had good relative standout numbers. And I think when you have that you\u2019ll see large flows there. And I think as I said before, I think the feedback we\u2019re getting from the institutional side in Asia if that opportunity is real today, in getting other separate accounts in that space. But I don\u2019t know if I could quantify that. Robert Lee : Great. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eric Berg : Thanks much. Greg Johnson : Good morning. Eric Berg : A number of your competitors in the alternative area have described the rapid widening of credit spreads in the energy area and in the high-yield area in general. And in the bond market in general, you have created just tremendous investment opportunities in the area of what they call stressed and distressed investing, rescue lending, these sorts of opportunities to invest in fixed income that is involving troubled companies. It\u2019s, again, stressed or distressed. Understanding that your primary business is traditional investing, to what extent do you have the capability, product capability and human resources to spend in this opportunity if, in fact, you think it if, in fact, you agree that it exists? Greg Johnson : Well, I think that\u2019s a perfect question to lead to our introduction of our, the fund that we just rolled out in the last year, as our K2 long-short credit fund. And really again to meet that need in an alternative category and we feel it really does offer a way to lower risk in a portfolio and really seize these opportunities that come because of stress in the marketplace, because of liquidity constraints and forced selling by some long-only holders that you want to have the ability to capture that. On the other side, and that was a category of one of many categories but the one that we felt made the most sense to introduce now and we\u2019re just in the process of rolling that out to complement our $2 billion plus in the global macro space with K2. Eric Berg : Very good; thank you. Greg Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gregory Warren of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Gregory Warren : Yes, thanks, good morning guys, for taking my question. I know we touched on share repurchase a little bit here, but I\u2019m just wondering what sort of capacity do you feel you have to make share repurchases this year? I mean, from a cash perspective, there are limitations, given how much cash is held overseas. And you spent $400 million in the first quarter and, arguably, the stock is cheaper right now. Do you anticipate being able to spend as much in the current quarter? And what sort of quarterly run rates are we thinking about going forward? Ken Lewis : Yes, I would just say the quarterly run rate is dependent on several factors many of which we\u2019ve talked about today, M&A, share markets etcetera. We continue to think the stock is at good value, we purchase shares in January, you could see that from our filing. And we don\u2019t, we have many options in terms of capacity. So I don\u2019t see that as a near-term issue at all. I think future share repurchases are just dependent on many of the factors that we talked about previously. Gregory Warren : Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. Thanks for taking the question. Greg Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up just for a moment, just on the expense side equation here. The pre-recorded call you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting expenses to be about 3% to 4% below 2015 levels, but it sounded like you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect all those to come through hit the bottom-line because of the execution relation cost on that. So, I guess just want to make sure I heard that right and not those expense cost to be fully offset in \u201816 and how should we think about the run rate there into 2017 and the expenses coming through them? Greg Johnson : Yes, your question was a little garbled so I\u2019m going to try to answer it, but if I didn\u2019t hear it right, please correct me. So, right, so we are thinking if you compare \u201816 to \u201815, we were targeting 3% to 4%, we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s 4%. That\u2019s inclusive of some of the expenses it\u2019s going to take, some of the restructuring expenses that I mentioned in the pre-recorded remarks. Our attention now is focusing on 2017. So, we\u2019ll do some modeling in 2017 and as I said, we continue to look at all the business lines and then once we come up, if we have additional guidance we\u2019ll provide them in future quarters. But it\u2019s an ongoing process. Michael Cyprys : Sort of 3% to 4% would fall down to the bottom-line that\u2019s not offset because I think that\u2019s inclusive of the? Greg Johnson : That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s inclusive. Michael Cyprys : Okay, great. And I guess just could you elaborate a little bit more on what sort of actions you\u2019ve taken so far because expenses did come down in the quarter and sort of what you\u2019re thinking about next? You did mention earlier some thoughts around out-sourcing. But how high-up and realistic is that on your priority list? Greg Johnson : Sure. So we\u2019ve had some staff reductions that\u2019s part of it, we had voluntary retirement plan that we talked about in our filing. So those were the examples to date and then looking forward I did mention, there was a question about out-sourcing but there are several things that we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re looking at offices, we\u2019re looking at business lines. Of course the variable competition is a lever that we can use and did use this quarter to a degree and so, all of those things are on the table. Michael Cyprys : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments. Greg Johnson : Well, again thank you everyone for participating on the call. And we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me to discuss the company's second quarter. Although we continue to experience net outflows in the March quarter, the nature of the mid-quarter market rebound marked an encouraging transition for us. As many of the weakest performing sectors of 2015, we're among the strongest performers in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, investment performance of many of our key strategies improved as did redemption trends. Overall, our financial results were solid as we continued to exercise expense discipline, notwithstanding some notable onetime items that are discussed in more detail on our 10-Q which was also filed this morning. Now, Ken and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Ken, if you could clarify some of the one-time items in the quarter, I know you called out some of the $40 million or so in severance but I believe there were some other things in the G&A line and others. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. We did have an impairment charge in G&A that was about $30 million. That was offset a little bit by contingent liability. So those were the two major large lumpiness in the G&A account. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : I guess in the context of last quarter, we had 3% to 4% expense decline for the year and now you're seeing 3%. What are the variables in terms of that change? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, one of them was that impairment charge. We weren't counting on that in the 3% to 4% guidance. And also looking out for the remaining quarters for the year, we might have another non-recurring charge in the fourth quarter, although that could roll into the first quarter as well. So those are two things that weren't known last quarter that we're factoring in as well as there's a lot of moving parts to this. We're rationalizing business lines and departments and all that. So we're just refining our estimate. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. I guess and then, Greg, as my follow-up, if you could talk about the DOL and now that the final rules are out, and how you guys are thinking about that? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think a lot obviously has been discussed already. I mean, it affects a huge part of the industry. I think, for us, it's difficult to get an exact number on the amount of assets that it potentially could affect, but we did our best, and with omnibus accounts, that's a little bit tricky. But we estimate that it affects about $130 billion of our assets. I think we're probably a little bit lower than most because of our heavy concentration in retail assets offshore, as well as municipal bond funds, and the fact that the key area around 401(k) tends to be in U.S. growth, and that's an area where we don't have huge penetration. So I think, overall, a little bit lower, but like everybody in the industry, very concerned about and still trying to understand what a 1,000-page document means to our business. And that's really where we're focused today is working with our advisors, working with outside legal assistance and really making sense of the proposal. I think the good news is that some of the most unworkable items have been adjusted, but that obviously a very difficult rule that will eliminate advice to many people that need it most and that's the smaller end of the market. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. I guess my first question, I'm just curious if it's \u2013 I mean if we can \u2013 you have a couple of new initiatives underway. You mentioned the NextStep strategies in the prepared remarks, and I know you've obviously taken some steps in the ETF market. Can you really kind of update us on maybe where you are with both of those? And then and particularly NextStep maybe kind of fleshing that out, what the opportunity is there and is that part of the relationship you have globally with the Citi? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I mean that is and it's addressing that area of the market using technology and trying to penetrate those that may not be large enough to be able to get individual help or advice. So it does address a new market for us. I think our partnership, a lot of that was based on our global reach and the fact that we can help them get the marketing message out in markets like Asia and Latin America where Citi has such a strong reach. I think that will take a while to develop, but it is off and running now. The other area is just around the alternatives and multi-alternatives, and we continue to extend our capabilities there with the Long Short Credit and Global Macro Fund that was recently introduced. And then our Liberty shares ETF, which will be available in June, and we expect to continue to build out that line as well. Those are just a few of the newer initiatives. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And maybe going my follow-up, just curious if you could give us an update on the institutional demand you're seeing for the global bond and related strategies. I know that's been a place in the prior quarters. You've talked about seeing increased interest and activities. Can maybe update us on that? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We are seeing that, and I think that's clear when our team's out visiting various countries and meeting that there is a strong interest in diversifying their currency exposure. So we continue to see a strong pipeline there. And I couldn't give you an estimate or number of when, but that would be highest, I think, on our list of opportunities in the institutional space. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. thanks for taking my questions. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. So just coming back to the $130 billion, did that include all retirement accounts, variable annuity, commission-based IRA, 401(k), and is there anything else in there? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it doesn't. I think that one did not include annuities, which you probably would \u2013 you'd want to include in that number, and that's probably another $50 billion in sub-advised annuities which obviously could be affected as well. That's a good point. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then just a question on M&A. Is my understanding both the UK and Canada fall under the U.S. in terms of how you're domiciled from a tax standpoint? If you guys wanted to acquire a business in the UK, could you restructure the business so you could use your international capital to do that acquisition? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Craig, could you just repeat the question a little bit? You're a little faint. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sure. So, I believe the UK and Canada are under your U.S. domicile from a tax standpoint. So, I'm just wondering \u2013 and you've recently done Rensburg. But I'm wondering, if you did a future acquisition in the UK, could you use your foreign capital to do that acquisition? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The answer is yes, we could. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It would not require a restructure. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It wouldn't even require a restructuring. We could do without that. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Did you use foreign capital for Rensburg? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't recall. We probably did. Yeah. We probably did. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much. Just want to come back to the impairment you took on K2. I guess that's been an area of growth for you, so I'm a little surprised to still see the impairment. So could you talk about what drove the impairment? And then, if you just sort of step back and you talk about maybe your incremental appetite for alternatives which seems to be a pretty big area of growth still for the industry. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So the impairment wasn't related to K2. In total, it was related to a specific component of the K2 business, which would have been the old business contracts that we put a value on. And so we were just adjusting that value based on there've been a couple of redemptions and there've been sales having met the original projection. So, that's why we impaired it. So, it's just that one stream of business, if you will, not the entire enterprise. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just your bigger picture view on appetite for alternative capabilities? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I hand that to Greg. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, I think we still view it, as you said, in a strong area of growth and we're going to continue to look at expanding the product line in less traditional types of investments. So, we're \u2013 whether it's M&A or building it organically, that's certainly part of our plan. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And this is follow-up. You had mentioned in your pre-recorded call, maybe just happenstance, but you had listed deals first within your use of cash \u2013 cash flow. Sort of wondering if you step back, how you're thinking about capital management priorities given when the stock recovery versus growing out the business. And within M&A, what kind of things are you looking at? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think that it might have been happenstance. Probably that ordering \u2013 I don't think it was intentional. And I say that because nothing has changed in our strategy, our capital management strategy. I mean, we don't say the stock is up or down so now we'll place more or less emphasis on M&A. They're all kind of independent positions. And we're continuing to focus on M&A \u2013 evaluate M&A opportunities. That hasn't changed. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Thanks for the time. Going back to the expense guidance quickly, I just wanted to clarify that the 3% decline does include kind of all these onetimers we're talking about. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It does. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then on the DOL, can you speak to Schwab decision to stop selling loaded funds today from the standpoint of your own exposure to them, if at all? And then more broadly, what that could mean for your sales, in particular, if that becomes a trend for the broader distribution world? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, I have to say I wouldn't make much of that decision. I doubt they do anything in what we \u2013 particularly you called loaded sales and everybody looks at the A share sales and assumes somebody's paying commission. For us, it's now less than 9% of our sales have a commission on them and we are traditionally what you'd call, I guess, load-based firm. So for Schwab, that's an \u2013 I would say it's a non-event that they're not doing that because it's probably less than 1% of their sales. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Right. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the world, as we know, continues to move towards fee-based and with the fiduciary changes probably more with R6 or shares that don't have 12b-1 fees associated with them, you'll see more and more of that. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : And you say 9%, that means kind of all kinds of commissions frontload, 12b-1, et cetera. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's 9% of U.S. commissionable sales. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, guys. Good morning. First, Greg, I know you called out the two global equity institutional redemptions at total $1.8 billion, but it sounds like there were some other lumpy institutional redemptions related to allocation changes and/or sovereign wealth fund redemptions. So just wondering if you could sort of provide any more color on maybe the size of those losses and/or the strategies impacted, and any sense of sort of the residual AUM that might be at risk for further attrition. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think the \u2013 there's probably another \u2013 there were two accounts that were \u2013 at total $1.8 billion global equities, one Middle Eastern sovereign wealth and another in Australia doing a rebalancing of a global equity. And then really only \u2013 there was only two other large global equity that were about $300 million apiece in Canada. It's interesting. I think looking at quarter-to-quarter, our global equity was actually \u2013 while the net number was very high out, it was mostly due to this institutional redemption fee. Retail trend is actually better, and I think the retail trend is important, too, to call out just in general that it was a lot better than the prior quarter with redemptions declining as well during kind of a choppy quarter. It's really the institutional quarter-over-quarter change in flows that mask, I think, some of the improved trends within the retail side, especially the hybrid side. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. That's helpful. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Nothing else to really, I think, call out on the large institutional ones. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then just to come back to M&A, any color on what you're seeing across the landscape in terms of pricing and/or competition, particularly in light of the recent rebound in the markets? I guess been hearing anecdotally that maybe the pipeline is starting to pick up, if you will. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean I would just \u2013 Ken can jump in. I think that's right. I think when you're kind of in market lulls and volatile periods, you don't really see a lot. And I think that's been kind of true that there hasn't been a ton of M&A activity. And as markets rebound, I think that people start thinking about it, so I think that's fair. I don't know if we could say specifically that we've seen that, but that certainly has been the case historically and pass it to Ken. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I agree. We haven't seen any specifics \u2013 changes in the trends. I mean, there are a number of targets out there that are always being rumored to sell and whatnot. And perhaps some of those are changing from non-actionable to actionable, but we haven't really seen a pickup in opportunities. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Gross sales across the board look weak over a multi-quarter period and it's driven by those cyclical and secular issues. Are ETFs in these multi-asset products, do they have big enough potential over, say, the next three to five years to offset the redemptions that Franklin is facing? And if those products don't have the potential, what's your next step into kind of driving the business back to positive organic growth? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it's hard to ever know. I think the multi-asset's a huge category that continues, I think, to garner more attention in the distribution channels and I think for a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more the flagship areas like the Income Fund, which somewhat has been a multi-asset before people started calling it that. You've seen a pretty strong rebound in two quarters of performance, and that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth. If these trends continue, that have really been moving that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from, just the fund alone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to $1.9 billion this quarter and that continues to improve. So, that's always been a big driver of net flows. I think the Global Bond one is a little bit harder, a different category and not \u2013 while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration in rates continuing to decline. Need to back up in rates. If the rates back up, that will see significant organic growth and I think pretty darn quickly because it'll be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment. So, I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that it can grow. But certainly the multi-asset category is a huge one and you've seen what's happened in Europe with it. So, there's no reason why that can't happen here in the U.S. as well. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just had one on repurchases, so you guys have come \u2013 had a few really strong quarters of repurchase, but I'm assuming some of that was opportunistic in nature. I'm just wondering how to think about that moving forward and kind of what level at your stock price might cause you to purchase more or purchase less from a U.S. cash perspective. Thanks. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So, I think \u2013 I was anticipating I might get this question looking back at our history over the last eight or nine quarters and I think the message that I want to give is that our strategy for repurchases is consistent. I don't see anything today that would cause us to change what we've done historically. And sure, it's definitely in terms of activity ramped up when the prices declined in the opposite, but we continue to believe in the stock and we'll continue to be opportunistic. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I know you guys mentioned in the pre-recorded call expanding into some of the local markets. I think Poland was the one you mentioned. Just wondering the strategic rationale for that type of investment in a smaller market versus maybe some of your key geographic centers on the distribution front. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it's a question of resources being taken away from some of the bigger markets because of our initiatives in the smaller one. I think we have always felt that part of the competitive edge we have is our presence in all these different markets. And for us, Poland is also one of our operations and servicing centers for Europe, and we have a lot of employees that have strong presence there and it is a growing middle class in that market. And you take markets like a Taiwan that, for us, years ago, somebody would've said why are you bothering with that. But they can become very meaningful if you have an early dominant position. So it's not taking away any resources for us; it's just continuing to build out that retail capability where it makes sense, and you add it all up and it can be very meaningful. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the color there. Thanks. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks a lot. Greg, on your \u2013 the pre-recorded call, you just mentioned as the market rebounded, both performance and redemptions were showing signs of improvement. I just wanted to get some color on what you saw. And then, I think sometimes when we look at the one-year to three-year performance, you've mentioned when some of the larger funds are maybe just under the 50 percentile. So just wanted to get any color on the larger funds, if they're kind of approaching that threshold to see the performance start to pick up. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, I think it is significant because I would look at the first two months of this last quarter as in a risk-off environment where it was \u2013 the underperformance was getting worse every day and just the last six, seven weeks, it's been probably the best overall performance and we talked about some of the concentrated exposures that we have overall as a firm. But I think that to me, it's almost also a leading indicator to the market where we were saying, hey, it's been 10 years of this growth value cycle and, all of a sudden, value is starting to outperform and you look at even emerging markets had a better quarter. Value was up 7.5% and growth was up 3.3%. So you have \u2013 I think the turnaround and what people have been looking for whether it's currency is doing better abroad, oil obviously rebounding, and that affects probably four major groups' performance right now with the energy exposure and also the high yield exposure in the Income Fund. I think all of that can turn pretty quickly. I don't know exactly which ones are right. I haven't looked at that to say the three-year number who is within two percentage points or that. But I think the more important number is the market kind of gets the drivers for our bigger funds and I think for the first time in a while, we're getting some wind behind us as far as the relative performance goes. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And can you just \u2013 a quick follow-up. Just on the impairment, I think you mentioned there was maybe an offset. Just wanted to try to understand maybe what the net impact was on maybe the G&A line just to understand from \u2013 what the build-off (25:03). And then I think you also mentioned about $20 million in performance fees. So I know those are hard to predict but maybe just in terms of locks or when you typically realize the outlook there. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Maybe it's better to just give you what we're thinking about in terms of G&A going forward. We do think that that line is going to come down a little bit so we're not expecting a lot of upward pressure there, keeping in mind that there's a lot of market-driven items that go through that line. So assuming a flat market, we just generally expect for the remainder of the year for that expense to come down from where it's been in the last two quarters. So, I mean, I'm not avoiding your question. It's just that you don't want to, like, waste all the time with the in-and-out accounting details. But generally speaking, we're thinking for G&A and other to kind of come down a little bit from where it's been the last two quarters for the rest of the year. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the performance fees. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sorry. Yeah. The performance fees, yeah, they are hard to predict and they impact over $20 million. If I think about it in terms of seasonality, typically we might have a little bump-up next quarter. So I mean, it wouldn't be unusual for us to see some performance fees next quarter and then, the fourth quarter, typically we don't have too much. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. A larger question, big picture question I guess on the flows. If you look at this quarter relative to last, things got a little worse, but we've talked about some of the drivers, the institutional impact and so on. But also I guess there's another impact and that's the market selling off as much as it did in the first part of the quarter. And so I'm wondering, I know this is probably really hard to gauge or frame up, but how much impact do you guys think that had on the flows? And I guess what I'm getting at is if we sort of didn't have this mini blow-up in the market, might the flow picture looked even better than actually what occurred? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it would. I mean, I don't think there's any question it was \u2013 when the market sell off to a 10% down through the first couple of months, that \u2013 and generally what is a very strong month this January. So, it's always very hard to say what would it mean, what would the number look like, but certainly, it definitely had an impact. And especially as I said for us, I mean, the positions that we had and with the dollar, oil and energy value growth, everything kind of moving the wrong way for the first couple months, that didn't help in the key areas where we had the largest assets. And we've seen the impact, and redemptions were actually a little bit lower for the quarter, which is kind of counterintuitive a little bit, but gross sales dropped quite a bit. That's what generally happens in that --when you get in that really volatile period. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it, okay. And follow-up question on the taxable U.S. fixed income business. There's still outflow in there. Can you speak to that? Is that primarily a performance issue? And if so, what's the driver? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The U.S. taxable? Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Correct. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, I think a part of it was just the high yield exposure and for us having a fair amount of assets in the high yield area and the overexposure to energy there, I mean that led to some of the outflows. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Greg, just go back to the $130 billion of assets that you thought were at risk from the Department of Labor perspective. If you could just stratify the 401(k) part of that, I think we were spending \u2013 less than $20 billion of that would be 401(k). And then, if the rest of that is IRA-related, are you just looking at the accounts that are with brokers in that regard? So would IRA assets be higher than that, overall? And then, is there \u2013 to any extent you think pricing dynamics might change in a post-DOL world, would that influence some decisions, longer term decisions on changing pricing structures in your funds including 12b-1s? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, as I've said, I wish we had an exact number because it's a little bit hard to collect and we did our best to collect from various sources. And I think the 401(k) specific number, which mostly is investment-only business, is about $31 billion, $30 billion, somewhere in that range. And IRAs are probably in the $70 million to $100 million range, I guess, is our best guesstimate there. And I think when you say it \u2013 I wouldn't say it's at risk. I mean, I think there's clearly \u2013 it means there's going to be some changes in how they're serviced and how we service and how we deliver through the advisor community, and still a lot of work to be done there. We have the share classes already in place that are being used today and some of that could move to those types of classes. We think the net result will be there will be more motion of money and we want to make sure, first and foremost, that we're doing everything with our advisors to make sure that the burden \u2013 we can help them manage this huge change. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that's helpful color. And then I think, Greg, on the last quarter comfortably, you mentioned there were some large variable annuity accounts, so we're doing allocation changes. And I thought you said there was one that looked like it was susceptible coming in that. I don't think that came in the \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong, did that come in this quarter or is that something that still remains a potential redemption? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That got moved back for a while; I think probably six to nine months from hitting this quarter. So we'll keep you posted when we get better color, but it's still, I think, still hanging out there. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys. So one more to DOL, if I may. So, speaking through \u2013 obviously the rule is still fresh and I'm assuming we're all kind of collecting information from various distribution channels on how things will continue. But when you take a step back, the $100-plus billion as I'm assuming it's grandfather and obviously because the sales already occurred. But taking a step back, do you guys think performance will be a much bigger kind of point of influence on the way financial advisors decide how to allocate assets from here? And I guess the reason I'm asking is if a fund underperforms for a brief period of time, is there greater risk redemptions other than new contract (33:08) versus what we've experienced in the past? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean, I do think it's early to speculate on those types of thoughts. And obviously, it'd be nice to have clear rules and, here, we don't in a lot of cases on the suitability and standard and how it's enforced and risks, and how advice is delivered. And I think a lot of that has to be vetted and figured out and a lot of legal fees to get there. And then, you're still going to have some exposure in doing it. So even the question of figuring out performance and what time period is the right one and at that at end of the day, anybody can question an underperforming fund versus an index during any given period. And I think those are the questions that we have to somehow address. I think at the end of the day, a lot of it is always performance-driven and more than ever. Today, you have more consultants involved in the selection of the platforms. So I think that has been in place for a while. And regardless of a fiduciary rule, I think that was just the trend where a lot of the 401(k) plans having a strong kind of \u2013 consultants helping pick the options, I think, that performance will always be critical. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right. Thanks. And then kind of just one follow-up on expenses. You guys have done a good job maintaining margins at the current levels and keeping expenses well managed despite of severance and a few other onetimers kind of running through the numbers. Just curious if you were to kind of strip all that out and say, okay, the base line is maybe a little bit over $2 billion for the year, how much more room do you guys have to drive the non-distribution expenses lower into the next 12 months or so assuming markets are flat? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think we're at the point \u2013 I think there's room. I think there's room to drive the expenses down more in a number of different areas. And kind of \u2013 what's left, though, is a little bit more complicated to sift through and come up with definitive plan. So, it's going to take a little bit longer to execute those cost savings than the ones we've done so far. But that doesn't mean that there's not more room to trim expenses, it's just going to be harder to see that impact in the P&L in the short term. It could take longer. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I see. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more just on your last point on some of those additional expense savings that could come through that could take a little bit longer, what some of them might be. I think in the past, I mean you referred to potentially greater outsourcing. Just any update on that and just generally how you're thinking about additional actions that you could take on the expense side. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think it's more just looking at the way we do things and challenging our business processes that may have been set up when the business environment was different, and just seeing if there is ways we could leverage technology to do things smarter and better and more efficiently and gain more scale. That's the point I'm trying to make. When you start to take that approach, it gets a bit more challenging and time-consuming to go through and that. But those are the type of things. So specific lines of business, perhaps specific functions. Just are we \u2013 is our processes best-in-class right now or can they be improved? That's what we're looking at. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just trying the M&A. Just curious how active the dialogue has been on the M&A side and to what extent we gotten close on a deal and if that's the case, sort of what's been the hang-up? And if you could just talk more broadly to your M&A strategy, what sort of AUM or deal value magnitude you think makes the most sense, characteristics that you're looking for right now? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, there's different ways of looking at M&A. I mean, we never start with, okay, we need an AUM target so let's look at the targets that have that assets under management and consolidate. It's more of a strategic-driven approach and the debt you have to marry with what the supply is and what the targets bring to the table. So everyone \u2013 every single deal that we look for the strategic rationale tends to be bespoke and adjusted for that target, so very difficult to generalize like in terms of AUM targets or specifics. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just on the activity of the dialogue, have you gotten close to anything and what's sort of been the hang-up, if you have? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean, again we have dedicated people that are out there looking at the industry and like I wouldn't say anything been closed and we probably wouldn't mention that anyway, but we're going to continue to look. And as we said on the last call, it continues to be a priority with the offshore cash to utilize that in a way that enhances shareholder value and that's really what we're trying to do. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think looking back, if there's one common theme for why deals weren't done, it tended to be cultural fit Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. On the area of expenses or in the area of expenses, would you say that if the equity market were this volatile as it has been and if equity prices were higher, not off the way they are compared with a year ago, would you still say that given the state of the business, what's going on in your industry, that there would still be a need to lower expenses? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think there would be perhaps more of a desire or want than a need, but we would still focus on that. And I think that that's a lesson that we've learned during the last two downturns that it's human nature when times are good to relax the purse strings and do things and do the nice to haves. But I think as a firm, we've grown up and realized that we need to be disciplined so that we don't get into those situations where we have to have massive layoffs or something at downturn and disrupt the business. So... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But I would also add \u2013 I mean, your question just beyond what are the obvious issues the active manager faces in today's marketplace with \u2013 and changes in the distribution model and regulatory environment. Even in a robust environment, you'd probably, yes, be looking for more efficiencies, but I'd also say you don't cut your way to prosperity. And we have always felt like there are times when we have to continue to invest, to be strategic, to do M&A, to bring out new products. I mean, I think it's a changing world, and just trying to cut your way to maintaining margins, you'll be out of business at some point. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And if I could just have a little discussion with you following up on the matter of share classes and the DOL. I find it almost a full-time job keeping track of share classes A, B, C, R, L, I, Advisor class, Investor class, Admiral class, it goes on and on. The lexicon differs by company. I'm wondering whether one of you could maybe make it a little bit easier for us by offering any general comments you think hold true as to what is going to happen here. In other words, can we say just as a general statement that irrespective of what the share class is called, A, B, C, R, L, I, whatever, that lower expense ratio share classes will be doing better as a result of DOL? That's what I'm sort of looking for, some general guidance on how to think about this. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean, I think that's right. I think there's more pressure, especially for newer business, to utilize what we call an R6 class. But again, I think it \u2013 there's still a lot of work to be done before you can draw any conclusions on how fast that'll move. And certainly, you can conclude that the lower end of the market will be more passive, robo, and less people-intensive or advice-driven. Those conclusions you can kind of draw how quickly the pace moves to specific classes. I think, as you said, there's a lot of work to be done in the meantime before you can just say X percent's going to be there by this date. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Dunn with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Hi. It's Finn (43:24) in for Glenn Schorr. Can you guys give us a little more color on that composition of the sales and distribution fee line, maybe what's the recurring fees versus the 12b-1, et cetera? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I can. So think it was \u2013 let me just get your reference there. I think that we included a slide. Maybe it was it was 27%-ish or something. It's in the back that kind of breaks down. So there is a component of those two lines, distribution, revenue and expense that is sales-based and we've talked a lot about what percentage of the assets are sales-based. It's very small. And then the percentage that's asset-based. And so part of the reason that the net line has been going down is because of the assets under management be going down. So if you look forward a couple of quarters, I would expect that the net number would be a little bit less than it has been. I think it's been, I'm going to guess, like 115, something like that and probably it might \u2013 we're thinking now flat markets. It might go down to like 105 net per quarter. Unknown Speaker : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. With the understanding that DOL's really focused on the relationship between the broker and the client, do you guys think there's any risk of increased expense load at the manufacturer level and thus at your level as a result? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think there's an increase in just your \u2013 I don't know if I'd call it specifically on your share class, but certainly the potential for an increase in how we did business versus how we're going to do business and terms of compliance costs and how we assist the adviser. Think all of that it's still there. We have a close partnership with many of them in delivering this and a lot of that has to be done, but there's no question that there's a major cost burden of compliance to \u2013 between all of the disclosures and sign-offs that has to be done that will increase costs. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Is any of that in your expectations right now? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think it's too early to try to budget that or figure out how that's going to be worked, but I think we would anticipate that based on everything we've seen. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Yeah. Okay. And just one last one, it looks like for some of the larger funds that have been underperforming, that short-term performance is starting to bleed into the three- and five-year numbers. Are there any large platforms or consultants that may be more focused on those longer term numbers that you could be worried about right now? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think you always worry about that. But as I said earlier, I think what people \u2013 if you could understand that performance in relation to the market, simply whether it's value growth or different exposures in portfolios and then look at more near term and just \u2013 I don't think I've seen a better six-week period of relative performance for our flagship holdings, and so that's going to bleed in pretty quickly, too. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Right. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : When you have 500 basis points, 800 basis points of outperformance in a six-week period, that's going to help pretty quickly. And I think that's the momentum certainly with Templeton energy dollar, more recently some financials. All of that moves to numbers pretty quickly. So I would be more encouraged about the six-week trend than I would worrying about bleeding into the three and five because that's going to be more important. And as I said, that will bleed in, too, pretty quickly. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. Thanks a lot. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking a couple of follow-ups. I think you mentioned, either Ken or Greg, on the pre-recorded call about the \u2013 that the fee rate being different on a simple monthly average versus an average \u2013 daily average. I think you said a basis point differential. Just wanted to sort to get color on the go-forward fee rate given the mix, is that then therefore fairly stable with the fourth quarter or do you see that lower? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. So I just pointed that out because \u2013 and it was my feeling that we're not seeing a big change in the effective fee rate for the mix. In general, over the last longer term, it's been coming down a bit but it comes down very gradually. It's been coming down very gradually and it's effectively very stable percentage. So that's why I tried more to point out the anomaly this quarter. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. It looks exacerbated by the average in calculation is what you're saying. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. And then I missed your response to the question on the performance fee outlook in the next quarter or two, if you want to repeat that. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think the caller before said it correctly, it's very difficult to say it because obviously it depends on the markets. If the global equity has a good quarter, I would expect to see some performance fees in June, maybe July that were similar to perhaps last year, but it's very difficult to say. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much. I joined a couple of minutes late, so I apologize if you did cover this. How did you stratify your platform that you came up with $130 billion of assets that might be at risk? And then when you thought about that, what kind of risk do you anticipate? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, it's a great question and I couldn't tell you how much \u2013 in terms of quantifying risk, I think we did our best in a, for us, in a world where we have omnibus and assets. We don't seem to come up with a fair guesstimate around how much is in 401(k) and how much is in IRAs, and we didn't include \u2013 if we include VA, that number is probably $180 billion of exposed assets, breaking out between about $50 billion in VAs and $20 billion, $28 billion in 401(k) investment only, and the rest in IRAs. So I don't think there's a big \u2013 certainly there's more risk than an average account because of the changes that are being imposed on the industry. But I don't know how I could possibly quantify that right now, Bill. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a matter of segment, what you chose. Just what is an IRA \u2013 I just want to understand, just an IRA or 401(k), then that's basically the selection criteria you used against the $130 billion. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Right. Right. Yeah, and then VA on top of that. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I understand. Okay. And then just one last follow-up. Ken, you mentioned that there may be another impairment coming down either in the fiscal fourth quarter or early next year, fiscal next year. You probably won't be specific on the call, but can you generally talk about where that might be and is it an AUM level? Is it an exit-of-business strategy? I'm just trying to understand what that might be. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, I was referring to we're winding down a defined benefit plan in the UK and I'm not really sure on the timing of that but that's what I was referring to. It could be fourth quarter. It could be first quarter next year. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Just curious if you could provide any sort of color on April flows and performance trends so far given some of the positive commentary that you've provided around the end of March. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, as you know, we're careful about any looking-forward pass the prior quarter. I would just say that the trends that were in place continue even today with oil continuing to move and energy moving in the right way, the dollar weakening, helping our assets and relative performance for some of our areas. So, all of that helps and certainly helps with the pressure on retail redemptions that you have a nice sort of rebound there, so I'll kind of leave it at that. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, anything that we should be keeping our minds on in terms of potential lumpy institutional inflows or outflows? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, I think there's still pressure on the VA business as some of it closed out, so there'll be some lumpy timing items over the next year but nothing to really call out the next quarter. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Johnson, I'll turn the floor back to your for any final remarks. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you again, everyone, for participating on the quarterly call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Conference Call for the quarter-ended June 30, 2016. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Operator : Good morning. My name is Matt, and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, hello and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining Ken Lewis, our CFO and me for this call today. The good news is that our results were pretty straightforward for this quarter. So hopefully, the commentary we made available earlier this morning provided much of what you're looking for. To quickly recap, although we experienced another quarter of net outflows, we did see encouraging signs with redemptions continuing to slow and improving investment performance, particularly Franklin Income Fund that as of July ranks in the top quartile against peers for the trailing one-year period. Financial results and capital management were solid as operating income increased 11% and the trailing 12 months payout was $2 billion. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks very much. I guess a question on both sales and redemptions. On the sales side, it's good to see an increase in international sales for the first time in two years. Just curious what the biggest drivers of that are. And then on the redemption side, I guess it's a similar question. It's a really big drop in redemptions; I'm curious if you think that was a point in time or are we at a different level of redemption because that can make a really big difference. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Glenn, let me \u2013 I'm just trying to be clear on the question. You said global sales, is that referring to global bond and global equity or sales outside of the U.S.? Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Sorry. Sales outside of the U.S. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think the \u2013 a couple of things. I mean the global bond which is a bigger driver of flows outside of the U.S., we did see an improvement, significant improvement in redemptions and that led to the major improvement in net flows. I think the last quarter; we did have some lumpier redemptions in that number versus this quarter. And I would \u2013 I still think, that's the one area that continues to be under pressure where we are seeing improvements in a lot of other areas in terms of flows. But the global bond, that's the one that continues to be under pressure. And I think if you look at the other area that I would call out just in terms of flows because I think it's a little bit confusing as the global equity net flows that increased and redemptions increased there and I want to point to \u2013 there were three lumpy one-time institutional redemptions within that, that totaled $3.5 billion out of global equity. So otherwise, on the retail side, it's an improving trend there as well. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then you mention the launch of LibertyQ and LibertyShares and you talked about three multi-factors funds I think, but can you just expand a little bit more on what channels you're going to be selling that through and what kind of uptake we should expect say over the next year? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean I wouldn't, I think we have moderate expectations within the next year as far as flows going into that. I think we have made a major commitment to that segment as far as resources and exposure and marketing dollars to get the message and brand out there. But it will take a little bit of time. And right now they've been up and running, doing well, performing well, and it's a matter of just getting on platforms. Now, we can do that probably faster than a lot of firms because of the relationships. So hopefully, that we \u2013 we have built and with our broker dealers and advisors out there and hopefully get some demand putting them on. But, again, it's a start for us in a new segment and it'll take a bit of time as these records get out there. And I hope it won't take three years, but we are getting a lot of calls and a lot of interest on them and I think in the meantime we'll also look at expanding the lineup beyond just smart beta. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Excellent. Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Wilma Katz (sic) [William Katz] (5:57) from Citigroup. Please go ahead. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. I think that's William Katz. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning, everyone. Just on the \u2013 on your P&L, you didn't call too much out on your prerecorded comments, and it looks like you had some softness relative to I think prior expectations particularly on the IS&T line (06:15). Can you give us a sense, maybe this quarter how much was still in severance in the comp line? How do you sort of think about that going forward? And then something near the line items, just given some seasonal and/or core-to-core dynamics? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Bill. There's about $8 million of severance in this quarter. And then, looking forward, and it's dependent upon a onetime item that may or may not hit next quarter, but inclusive of that, we do expect to see increases next quarter in most of the line items. I think comp would be more or less flat, but the G&A will be up. So, we're expecting possibly a charge related to the wind up of the UK benefit plan, and that should be in the neighborhood of $25 million. It may hit next quarter; it may hit the quarter after that. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, Greg, you had mentioned \u2013 gave us some nice detail on the \u2013 sort of how you're positioned on the other side of Brexit. Can you talk a little bit about what you might be seeing in July, or maybe before and after Brexit in terms of sales volumes, just to get a sense of what's going on the platform? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think there's been any effect on our flows. I think the July performance has been very strong and worth mentioning as the market is kind of settled back and even global bond had a very strong July. So hopefully that'll help sales, but we didn't \u2013 I don't think there was much of a disruption anywhere and munis continue to be very strong for us. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. William V. Cuddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken. Cash outside the U.S. continues to grow. What are your latest thoughts on utilizing cash outside the U.S.? How realistic are investments or M&A to utilize the cash? And how much hope are you placing in a new administration reforming the tax code? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The last point is a key point in the discussion. There's been \u2013 it's a current topic in Washington. It's been a current topic. It continues to kind of move a step forward, then stop. Move a step forward, then stop. So, we're keeping an eye on that. And we think \u2013 well, the consensus that we hear is probably sometime in 2017, there might be something that involves corporate tax reform. And I would point out, it's a long time ago, but in 2005 when they had that, you can look to see what we did there. So, depending on \u2013 it all depends on what we think is the best long-term interest of the shareholders what we do, but in 2005 we did repatriate some money. And so, that's not an unreasonable thing to expect, but it depends on what the law is. The cash continues to grow, and we're just planning to continue our capital management strategy that we've been doing over the last few years and essentially our payout ratio is more than cash generated or net income. And that means we're using U.S. cash, but U.S. cash still a healthy number. So we don't expect any material change in our strategy. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I would just add, I think my sense is in meetings in Washington that you are getting momentum on both sides for tax reform. It's clearly \u2013 Paul Ryan and something that he feels very strongly about. So obviously, we're in an election cycle right now. When we get past that, we'll have a lot more clarity on seeing how the House and Senate and the Presidency looks, but we are still hopeful that that's something that's coming, but I think in the meantime as we've said before, the M&A probability, and certainly with some of the currency shifts in Europe and the sterling, make M&A activity that much more attractive to something that we have had on our wish-list. So, I would say again, as I said in prior calls that that's the most probable area for us. William V. Cuddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. On expenses, expense growth seems to be coming in better than your guidance. Are expenses in this past quarter a good rate to use in 4Q, and as we move into next calendar year? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think as I alluded to in the prior question, I think next quarter, we should see a little uptick in probably all the lines. The most notable one would be G&A for that charge that I talked about. Comp, I think could be flat; it could be even be down a little bit next quarter. So, that's what we're looking for, for next quarter. William V. Cuddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for taking our questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks, guys. Hey, Greg, just given that you've had more time to go through the DOL rule and have discussions with the distributors and with the industry, just wanted to get your take on how you feel like Franklin's positioned and for some of the potential changes, whether it's 12b-1 fees or commissions, just how Franklin will try to position for the retail channel going forward? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that, obviously, it has been the area of greatest focus with our distributors. Certainly, since the announcement, I would say trying to make sense of the 1,100 pages. It's a little bit like a Rubik's cube where we're making progress and then turn it over and realize we got two other problems. So, I think we are getting some clarity around where it's heading. We've talked about a standard class of shares, that's something that within the best interest contract can work. I think we're seeing some broker dealers committed to doing the brokerage side and others saying it's not something they're going to do. I think the initial reaction that you're going to have a ton of money moving into the advisory side. I think once we really look at what that means, there's other implications of the rule that may mean monies that are held \u2013 that paid a frontend sales charge should stay where they are and not move to advisory because that would actually increase cost. But I think we are making a lot more sense of the rule. I think the net results are also that there'll be less funds on platforms. We're seeing that, again more of that consultant gatekeeper approach and narrowing the funds that any broker dealer follows, so I think that puts pressure on smaller funds out there to get distribution and ultimately less advisors. I think you'll see more retirements as this transition will be too much. And then, just issues, simple things that sound, again, I mean having a robo-advisor for a small account, but can you have your own ETFs within that robo-advice under the rule. I mean these are the kind of problems that I think are coming up, and obviously, the ERISA lawyers are trying to clarify that and we're working with many in the meantime. But I think the net effect for us is to have some kind of standardized pricing. We, obviously, we don't want to have 100 different pricing structures out there and are trying to come to some new standard that works for most of our, most broker dealers and advisors and that's really where we are. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up. So the quarter, there were a lot of \u2013 I don't know, volatile events and markets were all over the place. But we got some improvement and you mentioned July. When you look at those redemption trends in terms of the improvement, was it pretty consistent throughout and maybe even into July. Are you starting to see more improvement particularly given some of the performance trends that you mentioned? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean I think we're always careful about to talk about flows beyond the quarter. I think the big one for us that as I stated before, that it tends to snap back the fastest is the Franklin Income Fund, which you look at that category just two quarters ago, we had a hybrid $5.6 billion in net redemptions, in the last quarter $2.2 billion. So, I think that that trend we hope will continue as people \u2013 even in the last quarter, the three-year number or the five-year number actually improved back to the second quartile, and hopefully in another \u2013 the end of this month hopefully will be back in the second quartile for the one year. And as we stated earlier, we're at the 8th percentile for year-to-date. So, that's a pretty big recovery there. And I think that that's where you'll see the improvement in flows. I think we have some good stories as well on the equity side with one of our largest funds, the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund is $17 billion, $18 billion-fund doing extremely well right now and getting a lot of attention for its performance, which is first quartile for the one year, second quartile for three and five. Franklin Growth also very strong. So, I think those are areas where we could see a turnaround in flows. And I think as long as the market's stable, the other trends should continue as well. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. On the prerecorded call, you talked about a platform loss, and I think you've mentioned that at other points in time over the last 12 months. And I think insurance was an area of weakness a few quarters ago. I was just curious if there's like a channel or if there's any consistency to some of these platforms in which you're seeing market share losses are being taken off or is it just kind of performance and fund-specific? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think the main driver when I talked about a platform change was one of our large broker dealers that we work with building an in-house sub-advise platform and was moving some assets, and it was $1.1 billion out of our Mutual Discovery Fund. So, that's a one-off event that's not performance related that drove that. We did have \u2013 I think the other one on the \u2013 just in general. I've talked about the variable annuity business and how that's undergoing change, and certainly with the DOL, we'll have more changes. But we have seen some groups get out of that business. So, they're really in a wind down. So it kind of changes what they're looking for on their platform. And we, with our solutions group, we're doing our best to transition those assets. But they're the ones that still you have a pipeline of redemptions over the next, say, two years as those groups are transitioning out of that business. So, I would guesstimate that you probably have $5 billion plus in assets over the next two years that will transition. And hopefully, we can capture some of that but it will go out of the traditional funds into a lower fee type solution to meet whatever liability they have. So, those would be the big changes that have driven the lumpier redemptions. And I think we'll continue to create some headwinds in the next two years on the VA side. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on DOL. Could you speak to the penetration of your products in advisory accounts within the broker sold channel as a percentage of your total assets in that distribution channel? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't have the exact number. I know we have about $100 billion in retirement assets in the traditional brokerage side. I don't know what the number is. Maybe \u2013 somebody's putting some numbers in front of me now, so I hope they're right. But, about $40 billion in advisor class, to be more of the wrap side, so about 2 :1 in the traditional A share to advisor class Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : And that was actually up. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're at $140 billion total. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : $140 billion total and all of that is within the retirement accounts rather than in. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Rather than (20:31) \u2013 got it. Are those general proportions though different for taxable versus non-taxable? I would assume proportionally probably similar. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would think so. Yeah. I don't \u2013 I think they would be similar. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Great. And then, the expense front. Is the \u2013 just a clarification, is the potential for the UK charged next quarter or \u2013 and the somewhat uncertain timing which you highlighted, the reason why you just don't want to update that previous 3% expense reduction with commentary that you've given in the past? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I mean, it's not relevant. I mean, we've known this was coming. We're unsure of the timing. So we've incorporated it into any guidance that we've given in the past. So, I think including \u2013 inclusive of that, we should be within the range that we've told you before on the change of expenses year-over-year. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Great. And then, last from me. We saw an uptake in buybacks here this quarter. Was that opportunistic just given some of the volatility or a potential indication that your capital allocation policies may be shifting ex, of course, any momentum on reform and in the tax code as you laid out before? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Surely opportunistic. Trying to take advantage of price dislocations as they occur, and it doesn't represent any change in strategy. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. So, in your prepared commentary you did talk a little about Franklin's history, being able to adapt to changes in the industry and that's certainly well documented. But when we think about the situation we're in now, this period certainly feels a lot different just because it appears like you have a lot of investors out there that just don't want to own active funds or at least in certain areas anyway. So, and I guess what we're wondering here is what's your kind of long-term strategy to manage around that or manage that type of an environment? And, we know you guys have K2 and the ETF initiative going on, but that just doesn't quite seem like enough, so any commentary you can give in that regard would be helpful? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think, again, as we've stated in our prior calls, continuing to look at alternatives, continuing to look at solutions where we can add value outside of just market traditional beta as we again, stated before, to come into the market and offer passive today doesn't make a whole lot of sense for us as we've seen the race to the bottom and fees that continue and to drive down close to 2 basis points. So, that doesn't seem like an attractive alternative. I think we also believe that active, that there are forces at work over the last 5, 10 years that have contributed to the passive strategies and once active outperforms. And that tends to be in more of a rising rate environment historically. I think that conventional wisdom could shift pretty quickly. And that's something we firmly believe. But in the meantime, we have built out our solutions. We're looking at our multi-asset capabilities; we're getting a lot of interest in that. And that's just another area how we can add value to investors by combining different asset classes over time. So that's going to be an important growth area, and whether it's real estate alternatives, long, short, hedge funds, those are all private equity things that we plan on continuing to expand outside of your traditional U.S. large cap stocks. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think, Greg, you've mentioned \u2013 if I heard this right, $3.5 billion of lumpy institutional redemptions in the global international equity category. Is that correct? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right, right. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And so then maybe adding on to your commentary on the VA side of the $5 billion sort of potential redemption pipeline over a couple years is there anything else that you foresee on the institutional side, both positive and negative I guess over the next quarter or so. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we have \u2013 we do, if we know something is being redeemed, we try to call it out and I've done that on past calls. We do have a large institutional low fee account that was redeemed; I think this month about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion in the global equity area. I don't have anything to call out, I think the institutional pipeline again, we feel like it looks good, as far as the opportunities that have identified and RFPs that we're responding to. And I know one area that would be a new growth area for us but one that we've had excellent numbers, it would be on the Franklin Global Growth side, and we are \u2013 hopefully we'll see some nice wins there over the next year. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Kenneth, I think you mentioned on the recorded call some adjustments to CDSC amortization, and the impact on the sales and distribution expense. What was the level of that I guess in the quarter? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it was about $6 million. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: $6 million, okay. And you view that as one time or is it something that's potentially ongoing? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I think that's one time. There's a little bit left of it that we might get next quarter but essentially one time. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, Greg, just maybe your view, I mean you talked a little bit of M&A and that looking a little better given the build-up with non-U.S. cash. Maybe if you can talk sort of more broadly about \u2013 you've been in the industry a long time. Your view of to what extent we'll potentially see more consolidation in the industry if active continues to underperform and product needs to get rationalized. And then from your angle, do you see yourself as more of a participant in acquiring firms or potentially even combining with another large firm? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think the \u2013 as I stated before, I mean, I think any industry that is maturing and gets larger, you hit a point where consolidation makes sense. I mean, I'm not sure we're there yet, but certainly you have some outside forces at work that we haven't seen before. So I think that will contribute. I think the other point that I've stated when asked about this is that it's not the easiest industry to do large mergers and consolidations with funds are \u2013 you have separate contracts and boards, and it's very time consuming and difficult to do a merger. So I think for us, we again are open to anything that we think enhances the line-up and creates shareholder value over time. And we try to build as many relationships across our industry to be able to act on things that make sense, and that's where we are today. And I wouldn't state one way or another. I think we're always out looking on behalf of shareholders and trying to create value and if that's a merger, if that's an acquisition, we're open to any and all. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. That's great perspective. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on capital. Can you quantify how much excess cash you have in the U.S. operating sub today above any working capital or regulatory needs? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I think that \u2013 roughly, and that would even include some of our voluntary restrictions on it. We have about $2.5 billion U.S. cash, roughly about $800,000 of that I would call restricted of some sort. Sorry. Sorry, $2.5 billion and $800 million restricted. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And, then, if we look at your net income this quarter, $446 million after tax, do you have the mix that was generated in the U.S. And I also think your Canadian, UK entities kind of sit under the U.S. sub and then what was the level that was generated outside the U.S.? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of the earnings mix? Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not sure I have that handy. Yeah, I don't have that handy. But, it's a tough thing to estimate. And so what we \u2013 we see development quarter-over-quarter that earnings are shifting one way or the other. We just kind of project that out. And so, we just sort of shift this quarter. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Then on a trailing 12-month basis or a run rate basis, is there a rough range that we should think about? Is it like 50/50, 60/40? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think we're talking about two different things. Overall, GAAP income, again, we could say 50/50 is not bad but on a taxable basis; it's a completely different ballgame there. Taxable income and book income are completely different. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. All right. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, hi, good morning, guys. Just to follow-up around expenses. This year, there's a lot of moving pieces, a bunch of one-timers, severance obviously was a big part of that and it sounds like there's obviously another charge with the $25 million. So, all in all, can you guys help us understand kind of \u2013 as we look for 2016 as a whole, how much of some of these one-time items been when you run (31:57) expenses and I guess more importantly as we look out into next year I guess presumably these will not repeat. How should we start to think about next year's expense run rate? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Maybe that's a better approach instead of kind of listing all the one-offs and trying to estimate what one-offs will be next year. I think we could just like take a higher view of it. So, as we've been talking on this call about all the changes in the industry and because of all that, we're continually examining all of our strategies. So if we look forward to next year, we're looking at \u2013 and I mentioned this in a previous call as well, we're looking at every facet of our business model to determine if we have the business models and service capabilities that we need for the future and that may include structural expense increases or decreases over the next few years. So, that's kind of a long way to answer your question that we are currently looking at our cost structure, but it's a little too early to kind of give definitive guidance because some of these initiatives are multi year. But I can tell you that based on what I know now if I look towards 2017, it looks like expenses will be flat to slightly down compared with the current year or the estimate of the current year expenses. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. Assuming the $25 million shows up in the fourth quarter, the $25 million UK... Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Assuming the $25 million shows up in the fourth quarter, I think, correct. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I wanted to go back to the DOL discussion for a second. As you guys discuss the change among the distributors and more decision-making process taking place more in a kind of gatekeeper way and more consolidated top of decision-making and, I guess, more centralized, what do you guys think will be the criteria for active fund placement in that environment? And I guess, more importantly, how do you think you are positioned in that backdrop? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think we're positioned well because the first driver is going to be assets. You have that \u2013 around their books with their clients, so you're not going to eliminate those. And the other performance and risk-adjusted returns and relationship, the size of the company, I think those are all factors. I think each firm will have their own. Clearly, we will not have every one of our funds on those lists. And it may mean more consolidation of funds within our lineup as we rationalize. And that's been \u2013 an emphasis of our firm is to streamline the lineup and a number of products that we're servicing. And I think in this environment, that's going to probably accelerate their process of closing some smaller funds that wouldn't get the shelf space. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And then maybe if just squeeze one more. Around the fee rate dynamic, it seems like at least more recently there's been a little bit more or widened divergence between domestic product versus international product and especially given your comments about slowing redemptions in the hybrid side of the business. Is there a meaningful enough of a difference between the hybrid product, domestic equity product versus the global bond and international equity product that could \u2013 given these slow trends result an actual shift in the mix that's big enough that we can kind of see it in the fee rate or not very meaningful? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think that if you look at the fees across those different categories, they're actually fairly aligned; probably the hybrid one's a little bit lower, obviously, than international equity. But I don't think it would have a meaningful shift in your effective fee rate at all. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for your patience in taking all the questions. Curious about in the alternatives business, and obviously, you have K2 and you've launched some liquid strategies which had some early success. Could you maybe \u2013 I guess, first update us on the progress with some of your liquid alternatives? And then maybe also your thoughts about building out a broader alternatives capability where you would be particularly interested, and maybe update us on what your current capabilities are, maybe outside of K2? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think the K2 is working well as planned in bringing liquid alts to the retail channel. In the last year, we expanded the lineup and added a Long Short Credit Fund and a Global Macro Fund, and we think those could be nice complements again to diversifying a portfolio. Outside of that, we have a lot of areas whether its real estate and private equity and it's really trying to build more scale within those. So I think we are looking at considering acquisitions on that side, and continuing to build out our capabilities and just think it's a natural extension of what we do. But I think we are open, I think as I've stated in the past, it is difficult just to go out and buy a hedge fund or buy companies that have done well in the alternatives space because they are so driven by the specific person. But, we are looking actively in that area and whether, again, its real estate, private equity or traditional hedge funds. Those are all on the table. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And maybe just a follow-up on the global bond, global fixed income. You talked in the past about seeing these two strong channels of big opportunity for those strategies broadly and can maybe update us on that? Given maybe some of the performance challenges of the past year that's slowed down but where do you think that opportunity exists currently for the \u2013 on the global bond side institutionally. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think it's \u2013 the institutional market, especially, I think they are less sensitive and because this fund \u2013 to just \u2013 to benchmark it against global bonds, I think is not \u2013 really is more of a Global Macro type fund. And it doesn't fit really well into any one given category. I think the standpoint of diversifying from local currency and local sovereign debt. There is still a big appetite for that. I don't think that's changed. And I think also when people \u2013 sophisticated investors look at the portfolio and look how it's positioned, it is very different and does offer something very different and that it will be one of the few games in town if rates actually do go up at some point. And I think the risk, certainly, from the perspective of an individual country's currency depreciating in some cases is still very much there. So we are getting institutional interest, and that really hasn't changed. So, hopefully we'll get some significant wins in there. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And one last question if I can on the distribution, retail distribution, I mean, you've talked in length as have peers about changes there, maybe approved lists shrinking and a number of products you may have in any platform moving around. At the same time, you've had a lot of new product initiatives, LibertyShares, K2, your whole broad line of traditional products. So within that kind of mix, I mean, are you thinking or have you thought that there's some kind of change you need to make in terms of your own distribution capabilities? Is it, I don't know, shrinking it or is it changing the type of personnel given the changing product mix? I'm just kind of curious how you feel about strategic changes in your capabilities. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that's already been happening, and it's been really an effort probably the last three or five years for us transitioning your traditional retail sales force into a more institutional quality level especially at that gatekeeper level the people calling on the home office. Those are really more of your traditional consultants with that kind of background there to talk about metrics that are very different from how we viewed funds, I think, in the traditional way. So, that's already happening. I think as far as even our sales force, and we've made changes there over the last year focusing specifically more on having a targeted group for the advisory side that's a little bit different again than your traditional. So, we've been evolving as the market has been changing and we will continue to do that. And hopefully, at some level, you'll get some efficiencies out of that as we get better at providing useful information on a real-time basis through digital side, which has been a big emphasis in trying to reach more advisors in a more efficient way. And I think that again as the model changes, the use of technology and information getting to advisors can create a lot of efficiencies from the traditional way that we've done it. So, I think that's happening as well. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. That's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks much, and good morning. The improvement in the redemptions took place it seems pretty much everywhere across the complex except of course for global equity. And I understand that there has been improvements and very significant improvement in your flagship hybrid product. But it was also an extraordinary quarter in so many respects. What with the Brexit vote and terrorism and interest rates declining and extreme volatility in currency. I mean, it's a long list of factors that made it a remarkable three-month period. To what do you attribute this company-wide decline, not just in certain categories, but company-wide decline in redemptions? That's my first question. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the effect for us, and again, we've stated in the \u2013 we had more exposure to energy rolled up through probably four different entities. And we don't do any top-down risk management, each individual firm, we look at separately. And so, you had an overexposure to energy, had an overexposure to Europe. Those were trending nicely until Brexit, and even if you look at the trend in equities to quality away from more of your traditional momentum to strong balance sheet's rising dividends, quality earnings. Those were all trends that fit nicely into our \u2013 generally, into our philosophy with many of our equity funds. You did see an improvement in rotation happening, a rotation into value as well. And if you look at the quarter, I mean Brexit kind of hit right at the end of the quarter, so it was at the beginning, and maybe it would be a little bit of a different story. But what we had captured a lot of good relative performance during the quarter, which unfortunately in the last couple weeks when you had more a risk off environment, you lost some of that, which has been gained back in July. So I think it's really just looking at the flagship products for us. And also, munis, that's a strength area for us, and munis are very attractive in this environment, and should continue to be. So, I think that that's counter to what is happening on \u2013 and a result of a lot of the, I think, uncertainty in equity markets, money moving into munis right now. So, that's another factor as well. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : The second and final question I had relates to fixed income in general. And you've just touched on it a little bit, but maybe you could expand in responding to the following question. I have been struck by not only the fact that your company is having very stable, not growing, but very stable fixed income gross sales, and so are many of your competitors. It's surprising to me, given that there is no yield, and that \u2013 and the duration risk is very substantial should interest rates rise over the next couple years. My question, given all that, the absence of yields, the duration, the loss of principal risk, why do you think fixed income across the industry is doing as well as it is in terms of gross inflows? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean, that's a great question, but I do think fixed income always has a place in a diversified portfolio and does reduce risk. I think you are correct that where we sit in this cycle, I think many would argue that there's greater risk from rates going up. That's certainly the position within our Global Bond Fund. But at the end of the day, it's very hard to take a portfolio and just ignore fixed income. It \u2013 you'd put a lot more risk into that given portfolio if you go 100% equities. But at the end of the day, you look at something like munis. It still has an attractive yield relative to the Treasury market, certainly on an after-tax basis. And the general consensus right now, right or wrong, is that rates are not going up. So, I think there's a sense of security that even with these small yields, they're going to be fine for X number of years. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Cohen and Steers recently announced that they had hired Dennis Rothe who, I guess, was your Head of Consultant Relations. Was that separation your decision? And I guess what are the plans, I guess, for replacing him and has it caused any kind of dislocation in that part of your group? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it hasn't, and we really don't \u2013 we will not comment on about the surrounding circumstances with... Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...a departure, but it has not been disruptive and it's been replaced. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. And then more broadly, I know you're probably tired of talking about capital, but if we're in a situation where there is no tax holiday either because of the continued kind of impasse in DC and you can't find an M&A target, is it just the status quo then you'll continue to just kind of build the cash or are there other options that you would consider if we get into that kind of situation next year? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There's always other options and I guess I would respond to that as a pretty big hypothetical there with three or four possibilities. So, it's hard to predict what will happen. We just \u2013 maybe we have like an 18 month time view when we look at these things, and I think it's going to be status quo, we're not going to \u2013 we don't plan on changing anytime soon. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean I think it's the \u2013 we don't want to feel like we have a timetable to do a big deal that you have to do something by X and I am a firm believer that once we get past this cycle that some form of a repatriation will come through, but that doesn't mean in the meantime that we're not looking at opportunities especially with some of the currency devaluations in Europe right now. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : I guess on that point, you touched on this a few questions ago, but, your tone on M&A has kind of ebbed and flow over the last few years. What is kind of the primary reason that you haven't found something, has it just been a lack of businesses that really fit or is it more price? What do you think the overarching kind of reason for that is? Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's probably those two items and more. I mean we're pretty active every year and looking at properties and some of us come to us, some of us we're proactive on \u2013 and for the ones that we haven't done, it tends to be, they don't really meet our criteria. So quality, repeatable investment process, culture, price \u2013 yeah, price could be an issue and it has been in some cases. As Greg mentioned earlier, it's not the easiest industry to integrate. We think about that. And also, a lot of \u2013 we come across situations where there's ownership structural challenges as well. So, it kind of runs the gamut of why a deal doesn't go through. But those are some of the things that we found. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think like anything in life the best ones are not for sale right now. And we're going to continue to build relationships and I think if both firms see the benefits, then you can have a successful merger-acquisition, and that's what we're hopeful for. But at the end of the day, it's not \u2013 we don't feel like that's necessary to be successful either. And I think that's an important point too. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for your patience and taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the M&A point. I know you're not necessarily the easiest industry for M&A, at the same time I realize you sound like you're open to anything right about now. So, just curious how you think about the value and benefit that could potentially be derived from large scale M&A and/or potential consolidation. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've done it in the past and it's added a lot of value to this firm. I think we have experience, we recognize some of the pros and cons, and large scale deals just from a branding standpoint and product and disruption are difficult, and are making a big bet. But they're also the ones that are going to move the needle the most. So I think for us it's really looking at what areas we could strengthen our line-up, and there are certain firms that do that out there, but we also don't want to get to the point where we have so much brand and product that it becomes confusing to the marketplace too. So I think those are all issues that it's challenging to get two big firms to view what's right for the future, I think, in a consistent way. But, we're going to keep trying to do that. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just as a follow-up. If we could just dive in a little bit on the digital front, just curious how you're thinking about your digital strategy. I know some of your competitors have acquired certain capabilities in that area, if you just maybe elaborate on how you're thinking about it. Now I think you mentioned a little earlier just in terms of how platforms looking for more of that. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that we are looking and even with the DOL having some capability and whether that's built internally or we go out and rent the capability or buy the capability. Those are all things that we are exploring. And I think the traditional model of saying we'll go out and buy a robo-advisor for us. Again, unless you have a large scale ETF business, we're not sure that makes a whole lot of sense. But we do need some form of allocation for existing clients within. That would be helpful for smaller accounts within the fiduciary rule as well. So, it is something that we're looking at and seeing how those capabilities and looking out on the long horizon makes sense one way or another for us as well. And there's a lot of different ways we can do it. And, that's really the stage we're in right now, is meeting with as many of them and deciding whether to buy or build Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Johnson for any closing remarks. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, everyone for participating on the call, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Johnson : Well, hello and thank you for joining us this morning. In addition to Ken Lewis and myself we have Tom Regner with us today. And Tom is the Head of our U.S. Advisory Services responsible for both the retail and institutional business in the U.S. The fiscal 2016 was challenging in many respects as performance headwinds led elevated outflows, but expense management capital return were clearly positives. I'm encouraged by improving performance trends with several flagship funds as I mentioned in my comments this morning. Franklin Income Fund was ranked in the top decile of its peer group on a one-year basis and we saw improvements in all major asset classes overall primary timeframes this quarter. Furthermore the global bond fund has had significant outperformance in the month of October month-to-date returning over 5% through the 25th beating its benchmark by over 800 basis points in its peer group by more than 600 basis points. I'd like to now open it up for your questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions. Michael Carrier : All right. Thanks guys. Hey Greg maybe first for you just on the department labor you mentioned you know on the previous quarter call, that you guys in the industry are focused on you know some strategies around the DOL. I mean I think you said two you know potential you know kind of past. Just wanted to sitting and provide more color, the likely options and any update on your exposure in the retirement channel and maybe how you know this uncertainty has been weighing you know on flows so whether it's the sales or the pickup in redemptions? Gregory Johnson : I mean I think it's tough to really estimate what effect it could have on sales, but I think it clearly has been very disruptive, to the advisors business right now and sorting out, what is going to happen. I think from the last call you know we continue to make a lot of progress a lot of work being done. On getting ready for April I think you know the good news is that there seems you know our concerns always been that it's not workable to come out with a different pricing structure for every broker dealer out there and we seem to be narrowing those options down to hopefully two. And then you saw the recent you know announcement around a plain share class or super class or whatever you want to call them and you know having more of a stripped down version available at some point in the future that that could be an option as well where you have you know the pricing handled at the broker dealer level. All of that you know I think is happening the question about what effect will it have I think you know the net effect there was some surveys done that said one said you'll have 10% to 15% less advisors out there. I think that some would retire the transition is going to be very difficult to go to the new model. So I you know I think that that can be disruptive as well. And I just think overall you know our sense is once we get past this you\u2019ll get to a more normalized environment but right now it is a very disruptive force for the advisor you know last Tom Regner who's been involved more day-to-day if he has anything to add. Tom Regner : So we\u2019re spending a lot of time getting ready for next April. On the retail side, we\u2019re doing a lot of training and kicking off some internal training for both the internal team and the external sales team because we\u2019re moving towards an advisory business, which is really selling funds within a portfolio of context, which is different than we have and our competitors have been doing that so. We\u2019re getting ready as fast as we can for that change. Michael Carrier : Okay, got it. And then just as a follow-up, I guess just on the cash. Do you guys have been active this year with buyback and dividend, but for the non-U.S. cash, if we do get repatriation holiday next year or the year after. And this is I guess for Greg or Ken, just what would be the plan or the options with that cash? And then if not, how you thought about ways that you can maybe create some value with that non-U.S. cash, given that you don\u2019t tend to get much credit for it sitting outside the U.S.? Gregory Johnson : I guess by the way I would answer this question is it\u2019s hard to say exactly what we do, because we would have to see what the new rules are if and when they come out, but I just point back to what we did in the last time, which was probably over 10 years ago now, we repatriated the cash, and I\u2019d like to pay the special dividend. So those are all the options, but we would definitely try to take advantage of whatever was in the best interest of shareholders based on the law. Kenneth Lewis : And I would just add I mean how we think about it, I mean I think we all would maybe agree now that the probability is higher as we get past the election on having some form of repatriation and you look at that offshore cash and you could discount it, well it would be probably a 20% haircut or so if you take it back to the U.S. So I think as far as how the board and management think about it, if you have an opportunity offshore, it\u2019s 20% cheaper than one onshore. So we continue to look at anything that would be accretive and additive to our lineup offshore first. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I guess Greg, you highlighted the variable annuity outflows that have been occurring in our \u2013 I guess slated to occur over the next couple quarters. Can you talk a bit about why that\u2019s occurring again just to refresh us and if it\u2019s DOL related and then ultimately what\u2019s the AUM left in those buckets that maybe longer-term might be a risk? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I\u2019ll start and again I have Tom, because we figure those questions would come up today the DOL and specifically VA. And have a very strong business in that area sub-advising as well as separate funds that are for the annuity business. And really many of the large players that we grew I think at a high of about $70 billion in assets in that category. Many of the big names have gotten out of that business and as they wind down the assets, many are going to in-house and passive or low volatility strategies and we\u2019re trying to capture as much as that transition is possible, but it has put a large block of business in transition at risk. I think for next quarter, we\u2019re estimating another $2.6 billion in outflows and today we\u2019re at $35 billion approximately in assets that are remaining. And I\u2019ll let Tom, if you have anything to add on the business itself. Tom Regner : Yes, Greg covered what\u2019s going on well. What we\u2019re doing in response is we have established dedicated insurance solutions group within our overall solutions portfolio approach and where we\u2019re developing portfolios that have less basis risk. I mean one of the issues is with the insurance companies that there was a high basis risk in some of their underlying portfolios for the VA contracts. So we\u2019re working on reducing that. I think you\u2019ll see in the next four or five days, one of the top five insurance companies by sales is going to be announcing a new VA living benefit that\u2019s backed by a customized Franklin Templeton portfolio. So we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that we stay relevant with the firms that are staying in the business. Kenneth Lewis : And as of quarter end, we had $46 billion remaining in VA assets. Daniel Fannon : Great. And then just a follow-up I guess maybe Tom for you on the DOL. It seems as if the industry is facing a growth sales issue today because of the uncertainty. I guess as you kind of \u2013 we get closer to the implementation date are you guys assuming or as you talk to advisors as their assumption, is there going to be a step function higher in terms of assets in motion whether that \u2013 whether we see redemptions pick up or obviously gross sales could pick up as well. But I guess, where are we \u2013 you think in this transition phase for advice or behavior at this point? Tom Regner : Yes. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see a pickup in redemptions. There are some awfully attractive living benefits out there historically, which frankly hurt some of the insurance companies. I think what you\u2019re going to see though is initially there\u2019s going to be a slowdown in sales within the VA business because the commissions are coming down, there is no question about that, there\u2019s going to be shorter surrender time. So the VA business is going to be in a state of flex, but we know from working with our clients that we work with the top five in the industry that they\u2019re not standing still, right. So they are coming out and will be coming out with new products to stay relevant in the new \u2013 with the new DOL legislation. Daniel Fannon : I guess my comment was just on mutual fund sales, not on the VA. So just generally in terms of the advisor behavior broadly not just with VA? Tom Regner : No, I mean I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s going to be I mean look people still need to invest, they still need to retire they still need to provide for college education. As Greg mentioned that it\u2019s going to be difficult for some advisors because a lot of the business is going advisory. I think that the number is you need to have about $30 million as an advisor of assets under management to have a viable business. So it\u2019s going to be hard for some people to stay in business if they don\u2019t have a sizable book. So there will be some transition in the advisors themselves, but there\u2019s still a very, very strong demand that\u2019s not changing. Gregory Johnson : And I just think it\u2019s still early to kind of forecast there\u2019s a lot of people that would argue that the amount of money in motion. It could slow down because the tax considerations to that if you have taxable gains and one you can\u2019t take and move it to another and this obviously outside of the retirement world. And then how the incentives line up post this changed as well and then that could affect behavior on how assets moves and just stay old versus new, if just would all move at once. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Kenneth Worthington : Hi, good morning. Greg I think earlier this year you called out that you thought the institutional business have a lot of promise. I think particularly when it came to effect exposure management. Each quarter we tend to hear about these big, big outflows and it seems like there is broader base sort of institutional redemptions. So I guess the question is help us understand what\u2019s going on in the institutional side of the business and maybe characterize how you see the outlook? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think it\u2019s been as you know I mean challenging with Templeton and a deep value philosophy I mean that cycle has \u2013 the timing and the market\u2019s been working against getting new mandates. So the good news is that we\u2019ve seen things switching \u2013 moving in the right direction there for performance, so hopefully that\u2019s historically has been our area where we had the strongest institutional business and still have large facet, so it\u2019s been more defense and offence as far as wins. I think the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in local debt around the globe especially in Asia, we continue to work hard on those and have \u2013 I think a lot of opportunities that are still there in the pipeline. We\u2019ve gotten feel, but we still think that that will be the strongest area of growth and Tom if you want to add any\u2026? Tom Regner : Yes. I mean what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. is a re-risking of portfolios if you look at the public pension plans that are severely under funded, they need higher return. So they\u2019re starting to look at portfolios or asset classes that provide a high risk adjusted return. So I think that speaks well for some of the capabilities that we have on a global basis in fixed income and as Greg pointed out with value coming back that that speaks well for Templeton group too. But they have to re-risk those portfolios and we want to participate. Kenneth Worthington : Great. And then I think just to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question earlier on repatriation. How much time do you think it will take to evaluate the chances of repatriation or repatriation holiday after elections? Is this something that you think is sort of apparent pretty quickly or is this going to take two or three years and if it does take two or three years as long as the chances of a repatriation holiday [aren't zero]. Do you think it's just best to sit on the cash and way or do you start to get frustrated and make it a priority to maybe better utilize the cash? Kenneth Lewis : Yes. This is Ken. As Greg mentioned, we are always looking for opportunities to grow the business and that won't change internationally. Greg mentioned that all things being equal and acquisition is cheaper if we use on for cash. And so that it's not that we're sitting and we're not doing anything else waiting for repatriation, I do want to make that clear. We are looking for opportunities and so that's one of the strategic advantages of having all that cash would be able to move on something if the opportunity presented itself. But regarding the timeline for repatriation, there has been a lot of momentum and we feel like it's gaining momentum. Congress is working on the issue. We feel like when they come back in session, January is something they might be talking about it. Our advisors remind us all the time that four of the last five presidents enact a tax reform by August of the first year. So we are optimistic about it, and but we're also looking for other ways to use that cash. Kenneth Worthington : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. William Katz : Okay, thanks so much. Ken, one for you to get started. You gave some guidance on expenses for fiscal 2017 and 2016, so thank you for that. Within that construct, you also talked little bit about some investments being pick up on the tech line. Stepping back more broadly, if you would have to sort of replicate 2016 and 2017 we're sort of defined by choppy markets and some sluggish organic growth. How much expense flexibility do you have at this point? I guess the question we're really asking is, are you sort of reaching the point now where you get a little more limited on expenses absent eating some maybe the revenue generating part of the company? Kenneth Lewis : I think there's still flexibility on the quality expenses, but having said that I do think we're in a phase where those opportunities are take longer to execute. They tend to be more linked with strategic initiatives. So we continue to look at all that, is the business the right size et cetera, are we leveraging technology the best way we can. So I do think there's opportunities, but I don't think there's a lot of quick hits that would move the dial. William Katz : Okay. And then Greg, so curious, it\u2019s been some merger of equals between [Janssen and Henderson] businesses and I think you go up again in various geographies around the world. Does that transaction in and itself for the implication of that transaction, does that shift the mindset a little bit and could you maybe move that in with the allocation within repatriation between acquisition versus buyback versus dividends? Gregory Johnson : No, I mean I don't think it changes the mindset. I think in that case there was a clear benefit for the two firms to get into two different markets and leverage the distribution of each side to do that. I think the consensus out there of consolidation does create a wave of consolidation that obviously this is a slower growth business, it's a more mature business and one way to gain efficiency is through consolidation. So I think companies as I've said before are going to be much more open to looking at that avenue to create value. William Katz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning. Thank you. First follow-up on the I guess evolution of the distribution channel and that potential implications for you guys. I heard you on the prepared remarks around potentially launching your share class and that's something you guys talked about in the past as well. But any thoughts around the implications for management fees for you specifically in the industry broadly as we go through this adjustment in the distribution channel? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean I think as far as the preparation and effect, I mean management fees is something that again, I mean this is a extremely competitive business, we all see the battle versus passive every day. So the pressure on management fees is there regardless of DOL or not. I think the question around your product lineup and it's something that maybe Ken touched on a little bit on just where do we see potential savings and streamlining and what is DOL I think probably for us pushes us further down that path of trying to simplify the lineup and rationalize funds that may in a post DOL world may not fit neatly into more of an advisory model versus the traditional brokerage model, those are the debates we\u2019re having internally now and that could create some efficiencies. But I think from a cost side this is a business that every basis points going to matter and I think the good news and some outcomes of the DOLs as you are going to have a lower front end sales charge that will help with some of your relative rankings. And then as we said I think in our announcement that Morningstar, is now on the A shares is not going to use the maximum charge because most of it's done it at net asset value and that's going to make us more competitive where we see a lot of our funds will increase its star rating. So I think those are very positive outcomes and I think our concern of having 35 share classes at least now we feel like we will only have to add a few. Alexander Blostein : Got it. And then my second question along the similar lines I guess but historically you guys were very successful kind of keeping more assets within the Franklin fund family in the broker channel, partially because I guess waived commission. Once the client already paid that commission on one fund moving to another. As you migrate over to the advisor channel can you help us understand how that could impact asset retention and maybe just from a historical perspective kind of like what sort of the percentage of the gross sales that has come from kind of folks switching from one fund to another? Kenneth Lewis : Yes, I don't have that number I think anytime you go to more of the advisor type gatekeeper driven model the pros and cons I mean you can get significant assets quickly and you can lose significant assets quickly I think that's the net effect I think the advantage of the transition. It's like a funnel where there's going to be less funds available in the new model, but if you have large assets a probability of your fund being included even in a period of underperformance it's highly unlikely that it's going to be eliminated from that lineup. So I think size matters quite a bit as far as continue to get shelf space in the new model, but you know it is a higher risk from a retention standpoint than your traditional brokerage model where it\u2019s more a one on one relationship here it's more of a gatekeeper consultant driven more institutional type relationship and we've transitioned our model to I think adapt to that and have more people you know with consulting experience at that point of contact with the home offices. Alexander Blostein : Yes, great. Thank you very much. Kenneth Lewis : Thanks. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line Ken Hill with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Kenneth Hill : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on something from earlier in the call you mentioned looking at the opportunities you continue to do that but it\u2019s kind of pretty consistent with how you've talked about that in past quarters. I'm just curious how you're evaluating some of those opportunities and these related to the cash you guys have and maybe what criteria or metrics you might look at to base a decision on to essentially grow something versus look to M&A that jump start some activity there? Kenneth Lewis : I think in previous calls. We've talked about the share volume of things that we look at every year and you know that continues and you know that we - I would say the criteria that we use is a lot of it's qualitative you know we focus on the institutional process, institutionalize investment process can be repeatable key man risk all of that because this is a people business and cultural fit and that quickly eliminates a lot of perspectives. But so that that really hasn't changed and Greg touched on what's - some of the criteria that we might look at. So I think you know no change to what we said in the past. Kenneth Hill : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning, thanks. First, I just wanted to clarify the $46 billion of VA is that before or after the $7.4 billion of outflow you talked about it in the previous quarters call? Kenneth Lewis : That\u2019s before. Patrick Davitt : Okay. And then, the other question I have is on first liquidity rule and then broader regulatory concerns, one, do you have any initial thoughts on the expense associated with compliance with the rule and/or potential performance impacts on your funds that invest in more liquid assets. And more broadly does your expense guidance for 2017 include any associated expense for becoming complying with that rule? Kenneth Lewis : Yes, I mean I think it\u2019s probably early to answer any cost associated with the rule. I mean I think it hasn\u2019t been out very long, you have two years to comply my understanding. I think it\u2019s a much better rule than it was first discussed as far as something that appears to be workable for us and I don\u2019t think we have any major concerns on at this stage. I mean, we\u2019re still studying it, but our first reaction was that it is \u2013 would not create issues on the portfolio management side for any of our funds. But again it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re studying the rule like most right now, but I think it\u2019s a better outcome than what was first discussed. And I think liquidity is something that we manage very carefully with our boards and I feel like that\u2019s one of the most important parts of our business is managing liquidity, especially in the open-end 40 Act type funds. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Kenneth Lewis : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Lee : Great, thank you and thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the DOL and just maybe kind of feels like beating a dead horse a little bit, but you talk a lot about the impact on the fund business, but if there\u2019s going to be a movement to advisory, presumably that should increase demand for the SMA business. So I mean that\u2019s not a part of the business that I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about much. Can you maybe update us on how you feel your position maybe with \u2013 in the SMA part of the retail world and that\u2019s a place where you feel like maybe you need \u2013 also need to make some changes or some investment? Tom Regner : Yes, this is Tom. So that\u2019s a good observation. We\u2019ve actually added to the SMA business. It had been kind of a \u2013 if you will a quiet part of the retail business, but we\u2019ve added to it over the last two years. We\u2019ve moved into our private wealth division because we think that there is a big role for that in the high net worth part of our business. And we\u2019re working on adding some ESG screens to that part of the business as well, because we\u2019re seeing that as a kind of an increasing demand in the high net worth business. So good observation, we\u2019re building it up. Robert Lee : Okay. And then also sticking to the DOL, I mean I hear different things from different advisors and different managers, obviously you\u2019re going to have to have a level field setting and for doing it back and all that, but one of the things that seems to people different pains on is what [indiscernible] things like platform fees inside the revenue share I mean. So what\u2019s your current thought, do you think that in many cases distributors won\u2019t be able to charge platform fees or some argue it\u2019s going to go up others just going argue it\u2019s going to away. So what do you kind of hear? Gregory Johnson : All of the above. Yes. That\u2019s why I really \u2013 it\u2019s almost daily on some of different opinions on whether how do you retain it or how do you have a level platform fee across different groups that have different perspectives with different levels and different asset levels and how do you include or exclude the ETF that wouldn\u2019t have that ability. There\u2019s all kinds of issues that are still being worked through between and that\u2019s why I had to sit and say well it could cost us more, it could cost us less. I would answer, yes, because I\u2019m not really sure at this stage, we\u2019re working through it. Tom, do you have anything to add? Tom Regner : I mean that\u2019s a great point. We have one very large client, so they are not going to take any revenue sharing post at April and any new assets they put in the books. And we have another large clients that now they\u2019re going to continue to look at revenue share as part of the business. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out. Robert Lee : All right, great. And if I could just maybe one more quick question. On the ETF business, I mean you\u2019ve been investing in it and you\u2019ve touched on I think in the prerecorded call about it, another place you want to continue to invest. So how are you \u2013 from outside looking in how are you think about ultimately what kind of landmarks that we should look for success in that. I mean do you kind of feel like to you this is \u2013 we think we can really scale this quickly or that it\u2019s kind of a slow build and it\u2019s hopefully five plus years when you\u2019ll see an impact. I mean how are you thinking about whether you\u2019re going to be successful or not over the next couple of years. Gregory Johnson : I think it is a slow build, I think part of it was just getting in the business understanding the business and getting the right people that can operate a very different product in a very different skill set then what we traditionally have. I think that has been we would call that a success of having a very strong team in place and it\u2019s really building from here and recognizing any new funds or ETFs that we rollout will take time. So it\u2019s really about building shelf space awareness and I think we continue to do that, and Tom, if you want to add any thoughts on that? Tom Regner : Yes. So to Greg\u2019s point, we\u2019ve added significantly to the ETF distribution team and they\u2019re working with our 100 or 90 to 100 wholesalers to leverage up them as subject matter expert, so that's on the building brand part of the business. But we\u2019re quite excited to be able to have \u2013 you will hear them we are going to be building out more of our strategic beta platform because we want an advisor to be able to come to Franklin Templeton and we want to be able to build a portfolio that is either fully active or is partially strategic beta, partially fully active frankly are agnostic, we want them to be able to come to us to build out a fully featured, fully diversified portfolio, so as it we\u2019re all in on that initiative. Gregory Johnson : And expanding it outside the U.S. too as part of the initiative, which will take time. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brennan McHugh Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First on DOL, can you \u2013 is the idea that you\u2019ve got some upward expense pressure next year on technology. Is that a function of the indications of working with your distribution partners and as they make those changes to level pricing and some of the adjustments that you need to make to your own system and therefore that piece is somewhat inflexible? Gregory Johnson : I think it is not so much that it\u2019s other projects and initiatives that are underway. Particularly in the part of the business that does things like fund accounting and pricing and all that. I think that\u2019s we\u2019re trying to invest in technology to make sure that we can scale that going forward and support all of the \u2013 all of the product demands that are out there in the industry. So it\u2019s more of that unless really of the DOL. I mean we think we have a lot of share classes. We think that we can do that with just incremental spend but not too much. Brennan McHugh Hawken : Okay. Okay thanks for that. And then appreciate it must be pretty hard to manage all the different distribution partners and all the different approaches. But as you have those discussions and it seems firms are becoming more and more clear in what it is that their policies are here in recent times. Do you have an update to the amount of AUM that you think is exposed to this rule and as you\u2019re having discussions with distribution partners. Are you seeing any of those partners actually have an impact in the current iterations and in the prep for the current rule on assets beyond just retirement accounts? Thanks a lot. Gregory Johnson : I mean I\u2019ll just start by saying this rule puts all assets in a different place because again I think I\u2019ve said this before, but the thought that you could \u2013 you can run one pricing structure under retirement and then have the other business at a different pricing structure creates all kinds of problems as well. So I think many are just thinking about moving to one standard at some point. Now again there\u2019s different philosophies on that in different phases and so it\u2019s hard to say X percent, but I\u2019d start by saying all of it. At some point this will, is a game changer for the traditional way funds are priced. And Tom, do you want to\u2026? Tom Regner : Yes. I think that you\u2019ve seen Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, I think today Commonwealth came out and they said look we\u2019re going to treat the non-retirement business exactly like we\u2019re treating the retirement business because it\u2019s just too complicated to do something different. We\u2019ll see if that trend continues, but it\u2019s likely to if you think about it especially dealing with the same customer with their retirement assets and then their non-retirement assets and trying to explain to them why there's different pricing. Brennan McHugh Hawken : Okay. And then any update to the AUM exposed? Kenneth Lewis : No actually I don\u2019t - I think I mean to Greg\u2019s point, we're going towards an environment where I think it's all exposed. There's going to be very little difference between retirement assets and non-retirement assets just because it's just going to be difficult and I think someone asked the question and perhaps it was you about the technology associated with trying to keep track of all of this. It's much more difficult for the broker dealers than it is for Franklin Templeton. So when they look at the cost of the administration of two different buckets of business. I think they're coming to the conclusion that we're going to have one bucket of business and leave it at that. Brennan McHugh Hawken : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, but appreciate how difficult it is given how things are moving, but appreciate the color. Kenneth Lewis : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. John Dunn : Hi. This is John Dunn in for Glenn. One more on repatriation. Let's say it did happen, about how much would you say spoken for and how much is deployable at this point? Kenneth Lewis : Yes. Well, I think that $8 billion or so maybe $6 million is international or outside the U.S., well all that\u2019s deployable that remains to be seen, but the bulk of it should be. John Dunn : And then just one more on cash. With the amount you guys have, I would think that 100% payout could go for a long time. Is that a fair characterization and what might your willingness to do that would be? Kenneth Lewis : Well, keep in mind that we do \u2013 we paid our 100% of consolidated net income, but part of that is earned outside the United States. So that's sustainable indefinitely. I don't think it's sustainable indefinitely, but we certainly have flexibility in terms of the ability to raise capital or just other things. John Dunn : Gotcha. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Thanks for all the color on the Department of Labor. It's really good. Maybe just another one on that, obviously a lot of confusion we're hearing that as well. Just as you think is from a timeframe perspective. Do you sense that things will be pretty well buttoned down by year-end and advisors will be in a position to sort to make decisions about where they want to allocate and all the difference will have everything to wind up even if we do have two different ends or two different spectrums say by year-end or do you think this will go on for a while. And then Tom also maybe just what you're hearing from the wholesalers about the broad desire for advisors to move \u2013 to pass their products from active? Tom Regner : Let\u2019s start with the last part of the question first. As you move to an advisory business model, if you're charging 1.5%, you want to make sure that the underlying investment fees are if you will cost effective, right. So there is \u2013 as Greg\u2019s pointed out, there's a heightened interest in management expenses and that's going to continue that\u2019s one of the reasons that we launched our strategic beta lineup because we want to be able to play in more of an active space within the retail business. What we're seeing from advisors is frankly there's a lot of confusion because a lot of advisors have built a commission based business and that's where you're selling a product to a client. Now they're being looked at as having to or being required to build portfolios. That's a very different business model. That's a very different skill set. So we're working, again we're doing extensive training internally to be able to work with advisors to help them with that. And as Greg pointed out, we started building out our investment platform team seven, eight years ago because the platforms if you will, the gates research, gatekeepers become even more important, more powerful going forward. So we're working on it from both ends. And I do know just attending meetings, summer meetings with our clients that they've been working on this for quite some time. They are not standing still and I think many of them and you're starting to see the announcements are coming out with here's what we're going to do come April. So a lot of them have started to make those decisions already. Brian Bedell : Great. Just another question on the expenses. Ken you mentioned on the fund accounting side that you're reinvesting in that area? Have you looked at that versus outsourcing it and are you committed to non-outsourcing it at this stage? Kenneth Lewis : Yes. We have definitely looked at that and we probably every five or six years look at it again and again. And the conclusion historically has been the same and currently right now we think it makes more sense to do it ourselves and I would say the biggest determinant of that is our existing cost structure. So as you know we have extensive operations in low cost jurisdiction and so when we compare the cost of doing it ourselves to what do we cost for outsourcing it makes economic sense for us to keep it insourcing. So that's the current thinking, but as you know things change outsourcing companies get more efficient. So it's a continuous evaluation. Brian Bedell : Great. It sounds like for now you're keeping it in-house and certainly\u2026 Kenneth Lewis : For now yes that's our conclusion. Brian Bedell : Okay and then maybe just last one for Greg. Obviously the acquisition question is always asked especially in this type of environment, but I mean as you think about the types of firms that would be interesting. Just from a strategic standpoint. Would something that enhances your distribution capabilities which are already extremely large and build out different types of products, would that have a preference over say a rationalization and scale type of acquisition where you'd be combining funds into say merging weaker performing funds into stronger performing ones to get the track records and looking at more like a cost synergy play. Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean I think obviously there's a lot more opportunities to go out and just target a strong investment manager and bolted on to your existing distribution system and that's one that certainly in markets that we've talked about before and you know the pound so weak that makes the UK more attractive market despite Brexit we see that as a more of a near-term opportunity to acquire something that that would be you know additive to our lineup and strengthen our presence in a market where we don't really have a strong presence in the U.K. Outside of that I think the others become much more difficult and you know a larger one. That is much harder to do and much more disruptive obviously to the entire organization, but one that you know in the right situation again is something that we would certainly look at but I think it is much more difficult to execute. Brian Bedell : Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Gregory Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Harris : Thanks. We\u2019re looking at your hybrid category here, I mean redemptions have improved substantially, but sales keep ticking lower. It\u2019s kind of interesting that that\u2019s happening because performance is improving so much. So you can talk about that a little bit. What is going to take to get sales going here given the performance already seems to be improving quite nicely? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I think was exactly the question I had to our group early this morning when I was like going through some of the numbers I thought that stood out on hybrid gross dropping and there are some other moving parts in that number is actually the Franklin income fund, its gross sales were exactly level quarter-over-quarter despite that the number of hybrid declining it had almost exactly the same level of gross and that\u2019s the key driver that some other parts in that, I mean K2 falls into the hybrid category and that had a little bit of a drop off quarter-over-quarter. So that contributed to the gross number dropping down. But I think it \u2013 we are very optimistic that that fund should continue to be a strong driver of outflows in this kind of environment and I think it takes a little bit of time for people to realize that it\u2019s back in the top decile for the one-year and you have a lag effect of energy prices and what that did to a lot of funds and I look at across the lineup and I am very encouraged right now. I think we talked about in the past as a value, with a value discipline, you tend to get more energy exposure than sometimes the market and a lot of that has come back along with materials and whether it\u2019s our high yield area, the income fund area and hybrid, Templeton area and Mutual Series all of our rising dividend fund, all those funds now are performing very well. So I would hope that we will get some momentum back now on the strong one-year numbers and actually our hybrid and equity assets, 75% of them are in the top two quartiles for the one-year. So I think that\u2019s a big change from where we were six months ago. Christopher Harris : Got you, okay. And then a quick one on DOL, I think when we all think about those risks, we tend to think about in terms of flows. But just wondering whether you guys think ultimately this rule might force a management fee changes across the industry? Gregory Johnson : I think I try to answer that, before that I think the pressure on fees is there. I think those components of your overall fees, which are in a state of flux and you can look at parts like the revenue share piece in it, you do away with that that\u2019s going to make it a little bit easier to lower overall management fees and make you more competitive on that basis. Other areas, I think distributor retention, the historic number that actually was going away anyway over time. But that goes away immediately if you give a pricing at the broker dealer level in these new class of shares. But as the world was transitioning more to advisory, the traditional A share was getting smaller and smaller as part of our business, so that changes as well. TA fees all of those things, sub-TA fees all of those are again in a state of flux. So I think it\u2019s early, but just to say that it puts everything kind of in play at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Just want to see if you have any early thoughts on how the global bond fund, your new products and also K2 share with the new highly liquid invested in the SEC\u2019s new liquidity risk management role? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I mean I think that\u2019s a good question and I think our initial reaction is it should be okay, but I think again it\u2019s too early for us. This just came out. We\u2019re assessing it. And I think that\u2019s the obvious one you\u2019re going to look at and see how it works, but too early to really give you a definitive answer one way or another. Craig Siegenthaler : And just as a follow-up, how much that excess cash is sitting in the U.S. right now? Gregory Johnson : Excess, I think we\u2019re roughly in total about $2 billion and maybe $1 billion excess. Craig Siegenthaler : All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you see pricing evolving product management as more and more assets shift to lower fee passive price products and DOL going into effect. We\u2019re seeing price cuts in ETFs business there to drive more flows to the ETF player. How do you think about the price elasticity of demand for active massive products? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think it depends on how you\u2019re performing against the passive. I think you\u2019re never going to be passive on price is the consensus view like it is today that passive will outperform that\u2019s not a view I share and I think in the next decade, I think active do very well. And then if you outperform the passive pricing becomes less of an issue. But I think the world is overly focused today strictly on price and isn\u2019t really looking at anything else and I think that will change as well. But again as I\u2019ve said before I think any industry that\u2019s slower growth and has a lot of managers out there is going to be continued pressure on pricing, but an active manager you\u2019re not \u2013 if the consensus view is passive is a way to go, you\u2019re not going to increase your business by cutting your fees in half, it\u2019s just you're not going to get there. Michael Cyprys : And then are there any areas that you could speak to today where you\u2019ve reduced fees or put any waivers in effect and then just how you're thinking about the opportunity and interest for repricing act maybe in some structures with pay for performance perhaps using some sort of Fulcrum freight. Gregory Johnson : I think you are absolutely right. I think that you have to be more flexible that\u2019s something we certainly are doing in the institutional market right now, we\u2019re looking at new categories for us and coming with more of a performance based type fee because I think that fits what people are willing to do that will pay for more alpha. I think that the openness to consider those something we have to do right now because of the consensus view you know on passive versus active. So I think that that is something that we are studying as well on just making sure our fees are competitive in markets and whether that means cutting into profits to maintain share, I think that\u2019s that something you have to consider. Michael Cyprys : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions. William Katz : Okay. Just two follow-ups and thanks for taking the extra one. Tom if you comment \u2013 I will just move on that specific angle. Could give us a sense what the mix of your assets are between brokerage and advisory, if you have that kind of look through lens just given [indiscernible] on the bus and so curious given most likely going for the rotation to an advisory and brokerages. What kind of sort of money most we might be talking about? Kenneth Lewis : Well, the large majority of our business takes place without a commission. I mean, this has been taking, this trends has been taking place for a number of years, now it's accelerating under the DOL. So frankly we're almost there. As Greg pointed out, there's going to be a new share classes and less breakpoints and some other changes, but the business overall. Franklin Templeton\u2019s business and the industries business has been moving towards \u2013 on the bus and no load. William Katz : Okay. And Greg just sort of speak by your comments about the UK market, so when \u2013 the news mentioned that's maybe particularly more interesting given the currency dynamic. What kind of framework are we talking about? We are talking about a market extension type of transaction, consolidation and some of the redundancies or could you be wanted by something out from a parent that might have a majority stake in a third entity? Gregory Johnson : Those all sound attractive. And I think we continue to look at anything that would make sense and I wouldn't rule out any of those different scenarios. William Katz : I mean just one follow-up to that, in terms of size just given that where you are. Is a [merger of equal] is something that makes sense strategically or is it more of a fill in, maybe something that make more complimentary to your platform? Gregory Johnson : I think I spoke about that earlier that the merger of equals is difficult for a lot of reasons especially as you get this big, but they can be \u2013 that are done and executed properly they could add a lot of value over time. The easier one is just going out and buying a strong player in the market. That\u2019s available, that's not always easy to do, but specific to that market that would be attractive to us. But again, I just wouldn't rule out any of those scenarios. William Katz : Okay. Thanks very much for your patience. Gregory Johnson : Thanks. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. It appears to be end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Gregory Johnson : Well, thank you everyone for participating on the call. And again, we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Doug, and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Johnson : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me as we discuss this quarter\u2019s results. I hope you had a chance to read our commentary this morning that you find our written transcript approach providing commentary useful. Most importantly, investment performance against peers and benchmarks improved significantly this quarter. Although we continue to experience outflows, I believe we are much better positioned to outperform in this environment and we're seeing some early signs of flow improvement. Once again, we demonstrated effective cost management and extended our track record of annual dividend increases and share repurchases that more than offset compensation related equity issuance in the first quarter. We'd now like to take any questions that you have. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I guess, maybe, first, in terms of the pending DOL rule implementation set for April, are you seeing kind of activity in advance of the rule changes worth calling out? I guess, in particular I'm interested to see if you're witnessing any transitions from kind of brokerage to advisory. And I guess, are you set up to do kind of those tax-free exchanges or any transfers from like the A shares, institutional shares? And, really, is there any uptake of that? Thanks. Gregory Johnson : I mean, I think like everyone we are still preparing for the rule in its current form, but I think like everyone, we expect to see the delay, but haven't heard anything formally. But I think the consensus view right now is that you're looking at least a 6 month to 12 month delay of implementation and I think that that's just something that a lot of the broker dealers and advisors are really digesting right now. So we do expect a delay. We expect you know, potentially a complete replacement or repeal of the rule. And I think how it affects you know the advisory models over time that remains to be seen. But like everyone we still have to prepare for the existing one. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. And then for Ken, the fair value adjustment in G&A, I think that was with regard to K2. Walk us what's going on with K2. It seems with the negative adjustment, it's not all going well with K2 right now. My impression was things were going well. So, what's the fair value adjustment and what's going on? Kenneth Lewis : Things are going well, when - I think there's a couple of things to consider. Last year we had upward adjustments in that line now downward adjustment, so it\u2019s just quarterly valuation. And I think part of the valuation - large for the valuation relates to the legacy K2 business and not the new business that has resulted from you know, our acquisition. So on balance, I would say, yes, I think aren\u2019t going well. But you know, the legacy fund-to-funds business a little bit challenged and that probable - that was what the - our models were based on in terms of cash flow when we valued it. So that's where the adjustment comes from. It\u2019s not the whole business - it\u2019s not a reflection of the entire business, just a reflection of the older part of the business. Ken Worthington : Thanks, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning, folks. Maybe just staying on the DOL theme, I know you don't like to give intra-quarter commentary on flows, but obviously with the sharp improvement in performance in the fourth quarter, if you could give us a sense of whether you're seeing that translate into improved sales in January. Obviously, we have seen that in the fourth quarter. Do you see that trend coming through? And then, just looking at the performance year to date, we do see a reversal of performance for some of the funds just in January. I know it's a very short time period, of course, but you also mentioned in the prepared remarks how there are some advisors that do look at that short-term performance. Maybe if you can give a little bit more color on that. Gregory Johnson : Yes. I mean, I think first of all, I mean, the larger drivers global bonds and obviously that's been the biggest headwinds in terms of flows, and the rebound in performance and you know, just how that fund is managed against or not managed against the benchmarks that you do see significant swings and you know still a tough quarter for global bond flows, actually had higher outflows, despite you know, you could say while you had very good relative performance, but that relative performance all came right at the very end of the quarter. So a lot of it just takes time to kind of work its way into the broker dealer, I think you know, network and advisors and in kind of understanding performance. And our big message has been for the last month that here you know, here is bond fund in a quarter where the index down was 7% or 3% depending which aggregate index you are looking at in the bond market and here is the fund that that was up, that provides income. So that I think puts its - put that - puts that fund in a very unique category that again you know we think when advisors are looking for protection in a deflationary environment that it should do very well. So we would expect to see an improvement there and are seeing an improvement in the short run. You said well, some of that performance 1300 basis points we got in a very short period, but that's a significant number against the benchmark, given a little bit back on rates declining, but not you maybe 90 basis points of that you know, really in January. So nothing significant/ I think we are very hopeful that that fund will be viewed very differently in the market, but it does take a little bit of time and that's been a real focus of ours to get - to get that message and get that case study of the quarter of what this fund did in a rising rate environment versus other funds. They did position themselves as flexible, total return, absolute return kind of bond funds. It didn't do well in that environment and you know, I think again that just expands the audience potentially for the global bond fund. So performance is always a key indicator, I look at the - looking at our six largest funds, every one of them was in the top quartile for the 12 month period and 15 of our 20 largest funds were in the top quartile and that's about as good as we've ever seen for a short period. Brian Bedell : That's helpful color. And then maybe just, I guess, more broadly on the advisor behavior trends, I mean, I guess, as you talk to your wholesalers, we've been under the impression that there was going to be a lot more implementation ahead of the DOL deadline, before the Trump win, obviously and then now with the uncertainty on the delay of DOL, and on top of that, this perception that active management is going to have a resurgence, you know, again, post Trump the lower cost correlation and higher rates that historically have impacted that. What are you hearing from your wholesalers in terms of the advisor mood on that and whether advisors are actually going to dally that decision themselves? Or are they moving ahead? Gregory Johnson : I don't think there's one consistent view. I mean, I think you have a trend that was already in place pre-fiduciary rule of going to you know, more of a planning model, you know, against the advisor pickings individual funds, that's going to continue. I think the fiduciary rule accelerated that. I think some large firm's favor that rule because it helps them move towards that platform even faster. And that's where you get a little bit of I think some mixed opinions on what to do next. I think your common around this market, it\u2019s being a more normal market in terms of winners, losers and less correlation and less kind of central bank risk on risk off, it will favor active managers that appeared to happen out last year and that we think will continue to happen and that's why we still remain very optimistic on active investing. But I think to give one simple answer around fiduciary, I think you get some firms moving ahead like there's no change some that have stopped you kind of us stopping that implementation right now. But at the end of the day, I look at it from somewhat from an outside view that says you know, anything that took thousand pages to layout a rule that then took months of consultants and the accounts try to figure out what it means. And then I've seen all these different broker dealers interpret things differently to me that\u2019s not a good rule and one that is very open to trial lawyers to defining what really is the right rule. And that's not the - I think a good design of a rule and I think that's where you know the industry has to kind of take a step back and front five figure out what problem we're solving and then work from there. But there really is no one general answer on how the advisor side right now is moving, I think, we get different answers from different groups, almost on a daily basis. Brian Bedell : Do you see longer term, I guess, if the rule gets restructured, the DOL working with the SEC to restructure that rule back to what it was originally intended to do? Gregory Johnson : Absolutely, business I think also the intended or unintended consequence of a rule of affecting just retirement is that it tends to affect everything you know, as many again go back and interpret, it\u2019s very difficult to have one segment of your business different from the rest of it. So it does, I think lend itself to that discussion of you know, is it - is the SEC the appropriate place to provide a rule, but I'd also start with the, do we need a rule you know, as part of that discussion, as well. And I think that's really where the industry now has to meet with a lot of different groups and kind of determine what is the appropriate next step, but I certainly think that if you decide you really do need a rule that the SEC now is an appropriate place for that to be done. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thanks for all that color. I'll get back in the queue for a couple follow-ups, thanks. Gregory Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes on line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt\u2019: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you. To the point you made earlier about performance changing sales patterns for global bond, I think in the past a few years ago you were talking about when your equity performance had started to get better, that it can take years to really turn the ship in the retail side of things. Is there something about the degree of outperformance that we saw in the fourth quarter at global bonds that may make the experience different this time? Or do you think this could be a multi-year turning of the ship process like you said in the past? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think it's a little different with this category and just based on what's happening in the amount of assets that think about it, I mean the amounts that has duration risk, you know, in a unique environment and still very low rates, that likes to have income where can you go and that question is being asked right now and you've seen it in floating rate flows and you know, tips and things that tend to do better in a rising rate environment. So if you do have a kind of non-correlated alternative asset in that category, I think you can turn pretty quickly. I think equities are a little different, it takes a little bit longer because of the consultant driven side of that equation in returns and if you recommended redemptions on its hard, you just put it back in based on what happens in 6 months or 12 months. But you know, I think this is a different category and the question we hear it everywhere on how do I protect assets in a rising rate environment and here is a case study you can show pretty cleanly that you know, did that in the first real move in rates. So I think it can move you know, little bit faster than say your traditional equity turnaround. Patrick Davitt\u2019: Great, that's helpful. And then as the probability of a repatriation holiday increases, has your thinking around the size that you could do and what you could do with it changed, any more specificity there, and to what extent M&A is still on the table? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed our philosophy, as we've we talked about on previous calls. We've been optimistic for a while that something\u2019s going to happen. I think probability of that's increased now, as result of the elections, perhaps the size of the dollars that we can bring back increases, but you know, to tell us in the detail when they come out with this law. And so we have to wait to see what the law says and then evaluate that and what's in the best interest of the shareholders. But it hasn't philosophically changed our point of view. Patrick Davitt\u2019: And M&A is still something you're looking at or\u2026 Gregory Johnson : Of course, yes, absolutely. Kenneth Lewis : Yes, I mean, I would say, we look at still the world, I meant - if you have repatriation you factor some level on your cash that you'll pay, let\u2019s says its 15%. So you still have an opportunity to buy something outside the US at 15% cheaper than the trade-off of buying shares back and having that cash onshore. So I think it's still an attractive time, especially when you look at you know, the euros gotten cheaper, the sterling\u2019s down close to a third over a short period. So those are all factors that still make it attractive for us consider you know, M&A activity in Europe. We haven't put M&A activity on hold. Patrick Davitt\u2019: Okay. I guess, we've been talking - I guess, we've had that conversation now for a while and there's been no movement, and I understand the bar is probably pretty high. Could you maybe update us on the puts and takes of why nothing's happened? Is it a lack of opportunity that makes sense? Is it pricing? Is it people don't want to sell? Kenneth Lewis : It\u2019s - we've had these discussions over previous calls\u2026 Patrick Davitt\u2019: Yes\u2026 Kenneth Lewis : We look at so many deal a year, probably dozens, I would say, maybe more. And you know, we have made some and small ones and you know the first thing that we look at is what is our need, with what product needs do we have, what it is can we - there are certain market that there's a will meet a need that we have in a certain market. And then we look at institutional, the institutional investment process, because you know, key man rescue [ph] is a huge issue in M&A deals. And then lastly, we look at culture, so - and then also price. So you know, those of the factors we've screened through and you know, and a lot of the - a lot of the targets don't have the screen, but some do. Patrick Davitt\u2019: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William Katz from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. William Katz : Okay. Thanks very much. I do appreciate the streamlined disclosure. It makes life a little simpler, so thank you for that. A couple questions that come up just from both the commentary and some of the Q&A now. As I look at the gross sales for the franchise, you're running about $24 billion, plus or minus a little bit. It's really nice to see it stabilizing and trend up a little bit. Any plans to change the ad or marketing spend to potentially capitalize on this that might be able to jump start gross sales anymore? And, if so, any shift in how you might go about doing that between maybe product or distribution or digitalization? How are you thinking these days about that growth? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think, first of all we have increased our ED exposure over the last six months and we'll probably continue to do that. And I think you know the efforts in distribution that have been well underway on continuing to build out a digital strategy and combine the - we've had outbound sales groups that are now being combined with the traditional wholesaler you know, those efforts will continue and ultimately the goal is to reach more advisors in a cost-efficient manner and use technology to do that and that's something that we've been pushing hard for a while. But I like it is you know, it's a fair question just around advertising and building out also the consultant side of our business on the retail and continue to invest there, especially as the advisors are narrowing the funnel of funds they're going to deal with that we need to make sure that we're providing the best level of institutional service there. So those are the areas that we're going to continue to I think invest in, but I think that's a discussion we'll have as well - upping the strategic kind of spend near-term on the advertising from where it is. William Katz : Okay. And just playing devil's advocate for a moment, you were very successful in gathering assets for the gold bond fund in the up cycle, but I think one of the constraints on the stock was the asymmetry that created for the franchise. Presuming you were at the early stages of a potential recovery from here, any behavior, any strategic decisions to potentially limit the amount of AUM that could come back into the platform? Or no? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I hope that's a problem we have, but reality I mean, I think if you look at the conditions that led to that that kind of flow, I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult. If you look at when the global bond really took off, that was a period where it had an average annual return of 10% a year against the lost decade of equities. So it was in a position that that - and it was also the top-performing fund - that of any type of fund for that decade as well. So those are you know, pretty unique set of circumstances to have from a marketing side that I'm not sure you're going to have. Again, I also think the - that the volatility of the fund that you always talk about it and want to make sure investors understand the risks that they're getting for that return, but the reality is you don't control all of the sales and I'm sure some of the sales were done like a more traditional low volatility type investment when it probably is more like a global macro and now that we've gone through a cycle you know, where investors have held and seen the volatility, that may or may not be attractive to certain investors. So they have that experience now in a new asset category. So I don't think you're going to see the kind of explosive growth because of that volatility, but I do think that you'll see steadier growth and hopefully the kind of investors that can withstand those kind of moves up and down that you could have. William Katz : Okay. And just one last one. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. In the, I think, press release or maybe your commentary - your commentary, I guess - you had mentioned that commissionable sales were down, I think about 15% or so, from prior quarters. As you look forward, maybe DOL goes through, maybe it doesn't, how does that impact the mix shift of the business and the blended fee rate, leaving aside market FX impact, all else being equal? Gregory Johnson : Repeat the question one more time please. William Katz : Sure. I read, I think it was in your supplement, where you suggested that your commissionable sales segment was down, part of the issue is that was down about 15% versus some prior quarter comparison. If that were to persist, what does that mean for the fee rate for the Company, leaving aside - I understand markets and FX can be very big swing factors but leaving those aside for a moment? Gregory Johnson : Right, okay. So the FX part, so leaving that aside, I would just generally talk about the effect of fee rate, because I don't - I think there are some positive signs in the traditional business in terms of sales, the global equity sales were good this quarter. So you know, we do see pressure on effective fee rate, gradual pressure, though, I don't think there's going to be anything significant, but over the years, forward, we do expect to see our effective fee rates to come down a little bit and we've seen that in the last year or two. Some of that has to do with just the product mix, so whether its fixed income, more fixed income, you know, more fixed income at the expense of say in emerging markets mix that will drive us down. Some of it would have to do with the mix of retail and institutional, institutional tends to have lower rates, supplemented by performance fees. So you know, it\u2019s all of those things put together, but generally I think that's a fair statement to that we're seeing the effective fee rate decline gradually. William Katz : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys please update on how much AUM there is left in the sub advise VA? I know there's the pending roughly $4.5 billion redemption here in Q1 still expected, right? Gregory Johnson : Yes, that's right. And I think it\u2019s right around 44, right now. So after this next quarter around 40. Brennan Hawken : Okay, terrific. Thank you\u2026 Gregory Johnson : And we'll keep you posted as - as we see the - if there's any probable redemptions, we'll keep you posted on that\u2026 Brennan Hawken : Excellent. And then thinking about G&A on the expense side, if we add back the $12 million-or so one-timer that was referred to earlier, is that the right jumping off point? And I know that this quarter was seasonally lower than last quarter, but it looks like, generally, there is even further typical seasonal declines over the next quarter or two. Should we expect that off of that now lower jumping off point than we have seen in previous? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I think there are some - there were some other things in G&A this quarter that were seasonally depressed the number or reduce the number, one of them was advertising and we do expect that to ramp up, that was probably about $8 million, less than last quarter. And that is an annual seasonal thing that we see, where it ramps up in the fourth quarter. So that would continue - we would expect that to continue this year, professional fees was little bit down. We expect that to come back this year. But as I mentioned in my comments, when you look at all the expenses, we're looking, we're expecting expenses to be down around 2% year-over-year. Brennan Hawken : And that was for all of the expenses, not purely for G&A, right? Gregory Johnson : That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carrier : Hi. Thanks, guys. Greg, maybe just on the variable annuity, you mentioned there's new products, I think, on the solutions side that you guys have been working on. Just wanted to get a sense. When you think about that $40 billion and some of the new things you guys are coming up with, if you're starting to see any traction or demand versus the reasons or the rationale for the assets leaving, and if some of these things can start to stem that trend? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s - part of it is that you have firms that have exited the business, that are in a wind down mode. So it's really how do I manage this liability that the insurance carrier has, so you\u2019ve seen a lot of lower volatility or more transparent products that they can hedge, the risk out on those are really versus a traditional active fund, it\u2019s harder to hedge. So you know, we have developed some lower volatility funds. We have actually gotten some wins in that and hope we can continue to grow that. But you know, I think to expect - and I think our guys are fairly optimistic on the potential there on this change to get some new assets from others as well. I just don't have a sense for what the probability of that is and can that that offset a potential a decline of another $20 billion, who knows, I don't know. But I think whenever there's change like that there's opportunity and we have developed products there. We are getting some wins in the 100 million, 200 million range, but we need some bigger ones to offset the other numbers. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just a follow-up, it seemed during the quarter the performance overall was very strong. And when we track it, I think on the fund side it looked like it was, on a blended basis, up maybe 2%. But in the fund table it seems like the market appreciation was very muted. So, I'm just trying to figure out, was there something on the institutional side, was it FX, was there anything on the distribution side in the quarter? I know we have that line in there now. But I'm just trying to understand. It seemed like the performance versus the appreciation in the table isn't lining up. Gregory Johnson : Yes, and there was some affects in the numbers this quarter, related to you know, assets under management in non-US dollar price funds and that almost $5 billion in the quarter. Michael Carrier : Okay. It just seems more pronounced but maybe we can follow-up. Thanks a lot. Gregory Johnson : Yes, and distributions are not in that number where there were before, that you're looking at quarter-to-quarter, because of changed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBD. Please proceed with your question. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gregory Johnson : Morning. Robert Lee : Just another capital management question. Share repurchases continued at a pretty high rate, $7 million this quarter. It's been running above your US cash generation for a while now. So, can you just give us a sense of, assuming your appetite is still there for share repurchase at a high rate, how much more capacity you have to continue to repurchase or return capital above what you're generating in the US, obviously excluding any potential repatriation holiday or what not? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I think one of the things that's happening is the mix of the earnings, US and non-US is increasing, so our US cash flow is increasing. I mean, that\u2019s a function of the increase in assets under management for funds managed in the US. That's something that you might not see, right away, but you'll see over time in the disclosures. And so we feel pretty comfortable that we could continue our share repurchase activity for you know, at least the short-term one year period, with no problems. Robert Lee : Okay, great. Then maybe a quick follow-up. I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about, almost in passing, a non-managed volatility product for the insurance channel. But, more broadly, the one thing we don't hear maybe quite as much from you guys every quarter is where you stand with expanding the franchise into - I guess it's called non-traditional strategies, whether it's the managed vol [ph] products, whether it's alternative products. Could you maybe update us and, number one, roughly size how big maybe some of those buckets may be, what they are, and what your plans are, or at least the sales trends have been in those areas? Gregory Johnson : I mean, I don't - we don't have that in front of us on the breakdown. I think in terms of the commitment, I mean, we think that's going to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy, especially as you know the industry battles the traditional active passive and wherever we can you know add less correlated type assets to that fold and that's going to important that are also less - that are harder to replicate. So we have a lot of investments made in a lot of different areas and a lot of funds, but I just don't have the rolled up number here, I mean, we're in private equity and real estate and a lot of - what some would call traditional alternatives, but I just don't know what that number would look like\u2026 Kenneth Lewis : It\u2019s clearly a strategic priority we're looking at, you know, our business right now, in the alternative side the solution side, that we have the right products in place, [indiscernible] in place, is that an area we want to focus on in M&A that\u2019s probably you know, if we were to do M&A acquisitions that be clearly an area that we would focus on versus traditional assets under management. So, kind of it\u2019s definitely priority for us, and we recognize that segment of the market that presents opportunities for us. Robert Lee : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris Harris : Thanks, guys. You sound a little optimistic on the institutional pipeline. Just wondering if you guys can talk a little bit about the breadth of that and anything else that might help us gauge the size of potential things that might be coming in. Kenneth Lewis : I mean, I think it looks like it's more from the pipeline - you kind of global lag emerging markets, local currencies, you know we are getting a lot of interest as good numbers and those can result in some larger type wins, probably a little bit lower fees, but in terms of assets bigger. So that's really where we're seeing. I don't - we don't really present a number and probability like some others do for the quarter, but you know, it\u2019s certainly you know - that's the area that that we are currently have a lot of searches that are underway in presentations and identified some probable wins in the next quarter, those two categories. Chris Harris : Okay. And then the discussion around the fee rate, you'd mentioned safe to assume long-term pressure there. But if we do see a pretty dramatic recovery in global bond, is it safe to assume under that scenario that's going to put a pretty big upward bias on your fee rate? I believe that tends to be one of your higher fee products. Kenneth Lewis : Yeah, I would say that it would mitigate any further down pressure on the fee rate versus actually increasing it. Chris Harris : Okay. All right Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious how you're thinking about possibly using greater use of performance fees in your products on the retail and institutional side. Just any thoughts you could update us on there. Kenneth Lewis : I think that's something we talked about last quarter as well. And I think with the pressure on fees, the pressure on any fiduciary's, whether endowments and people doing searches you know, the - I think the probability for us of doing more around performance fees is very high. We have actually been doing some pricing on institutional mandates going in areas certain, I think more outside the US with some sovereign wealth fund and things, but that's something that we think can be I think a very useful answer to some of these high pressures around just these and rationalizing versus passive is only paying on the alpha and that's something you know, that we certainly are looking at. I don't think we have the same kind of pressure on the retail side, nor do we think that it makes a lot of sense certainly on institutional side, that's you know, we think that could be very additive to our overall lineup. Michael Cyprys : Okay, great. Just as a follow-up to the topic on sub-advisory, just curious how you're thinking about the opportunity there for gathering assets. If you could just update us a little bit on pricing levels within sub-advisory. Where is that today? And how are you thinking about pricing pressure in sub-advisory versus other parts of your business and retail versus institutional? Kenneth Lewis : Yes, I mean, I think the sub-advisories model it\u2019s one that we've been very open to and you know, certainly look at places like Japan where that that really is the business model that we are pursuing. I think there's always some restrictions on how aggressive you can be, there is certain mandates that come in and clearly you could probably rationalize that on individual basis, which can't rationalize it against you know, your pricing of other products in that category. So you are somewhat limited by your retail pricing on how aggressive you can be in sub-advisory model and that's where we look at, whether it makes sense of bringing in more institutionally oriented boutiques that can again be more flexible on pricing and not have the issue you know, of 40 act funds ag [ph] behind it. That\u2019s something that when we look at our M&A strategy is something that you know, I think we think can make a lot of sense. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell : Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Maybe just, Ken, to go back on the expense commentary. I just want to make sure I have that right. The expenses down 2%. Is that excluding the sales and distribution and marketing expense? So, instead of the $4.2 billion\u2026 Kenneth Lewis : Thanks for the follow-up. And regarding you know, I look at - when I look at sales and distribution, I look at the revenue, net of the expenses and you know, that number, we expect that number - that net number which is in the kind of an appendix to the presentation, give you some detail on that, we expect that to be more or less flat, but probably increasingly the latter part of the year and given current AUM levels and of course that\u2019s a function of sales and all that. But the current AUM levels, we expect that line to be fairly consistent with maybe an upward trend later in the year. Brian Bedell : This is the appendix on slide 25? Kenneth Lewis : I am going to say that you are correct there. It\u2019s in the back there. Brian Bedell : In sales and distribution summary, right? Okay. Kenneth Lewis : I think it was about 100 this quarter. Brian Bedell : Yes. And again you expect it to go up a little bit? Kenneth Lewis : So what my comments were about the non-sales and distribution lines before. Brian Bedell : Right, right. Okay. Actually, one other clarification on repatriation. I think you said this a couple quarters ago in terms of the amount of cash that you thought was available to repatriate. I thought it was around $6.5 billion. And then I think you just said that might increase. Do you have an updated number of that? Kenneth Lewis : No, I think it\u2019s still pretty close to that number. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then maybe just one last one on the fee rate compression commentary, your expectation for that. You mentioned that it's mix. Is it really your expectation that the mix will shift towards more institutional channels or are there other product mix by strategy baked into that assumption? Kenneth Lewis : Well, yes, it\u2019s a combination of both, so if you go back in time when global equity in this firm was a big part of AUM, we had a higher effective fee rate because they are higher a fee earning products. The other dynamic is - and this is more accounting numbers t than economics, but if we have increased AUM internationally, that will that will put up the pressure on the effective fee rate, because that effective fee rate covers distribution expenses where in the states all that's bifurcated in different revenue streams and then the last thing is the channel mix, whether it's retail or institutional. It\u2019s hard to say, but just projecting out where we are today, we do see maybe a basis point year, or something like that, not very much. Brian Bedell : Right. And then baked into those assumptions, you are - this is to a prior question about considering reducing some fees and replacing those with performance fees on the institutional side-- is that also baked into this assumption or would that be over and above? Kenneth Lewis : Not really because you know its early days for that. And I don't know if that would move the needle it. We were just making the commentary that you might see some additional performance fee income that you haven't seen in the past for us, right, for early days. Brian Bedell : Great, great. Thanks for taking my follow up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Ari Ghosh : Hi, good morning, guys. This is Ari Ghosh filling in for Craig. Just a quick one on fees. Have you lowered pricing on any of your retail funds over the last few quarters, either with expense caps, fee waivers or straight fee cuts? Thanks. Kenneth Lewis : I think there is been a few reductions, I think there is been some in emerging markets, as well as we lowered some of our UK retail funds, but nothing in the larger. And I think meal most of our bigger funds are still below average in terms of fees relative to the group. So it's just really the ones that we're positioned above the market that we you know, we've taken down. Ari Ghosh : Got it. And just in terms of magnitude, like percentage of AUM, can you provide a number? Kenneth Lewis : Yes, was not a bit maybe, the UK ones were relatively small and still the emerging markets were a huge number. So very - that mean 1% or less\u2026. Ari Ghosh : Got it\u2026 Kenneth Lewis : That it would have affected of assets. Ari Ghosh : Got it. Thanks. Kenneth Lewis : Okay. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments. Gregory Johnson : Well, thank you everyone for attending the call today. And again, we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instruction] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the floor over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, hello, and thank you for joining Ken and me this morning to discuss our second quarter results. I know it's been a busy week for most of you, so hopefully, the commentary we provided earlier this morning easily address most of your questions. This quarter we saw a number of encouraging signs with retail flow trends improving in some regions and funds returning to net inflows. While we clearly have more progress to make, investment performance is strengthening, which is a positive sign for future flow trends. Importantly, the financial condition of our firm remains strong and we continue to position ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our clients. I'd now like to open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I guess in the commentary, Greg, you're generally positive institutionally in talking about sales in the U.S. hitting levels we haven't seen since 2015. And I guess just where \u2013 I want to talk about that more broadly in terms of kind of where you still see the headwinds, whether that's on the international front? And I guess, specifically, what products institutionally in the U.S. are you seeing the most demand? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think, first of all, I mean it was really retail sales where we saw the big improvement in \u2013 certainly in gross and even on the international side, probably had net inflows, if you take out some of the lumpier institutional redemptions. I think just overall, from just looking at the more normalized levels that we're seeing strong improvements in both gross and net on the back of strong performance. And I think just sometimes the institutional redemptions and certainly the headwinds we've talked about, whether it's the variable annuity side, which we had a smaller quarter in terms of net redemptions of about $1 billion. But we had some other lumpy net \u2013 or institutional account redemptions on the global equity side, and that's really where \u2013 I think if you look at the flows where we had four, five large redemptions, none of them \u2013 I think, one a Middle Eastern client that not a performance-related redemption, just really a cash flow need kind of situation. And then, you had redemptions related to a platform moving to sub-advisory that had a couple large funds as well. And then, just a couple of $0.5 billion type global equity redemption. So, if we look at the big changes over the quarter, Global Bonds, certainly from a retail side, much improved, and really in Europe is where we're seeing the dramatic improvement in redemptions and flows there, and that's an encouraging sign and one that we know, if we continue to get momentum in that, that can turn into significant inflows, and that's what hopefully we expect in the short run. But, overall, I think improvement in just about every area, except the global equities, and most of that was just due to the institutional side. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just, Ken, a follow-up on your commentary around expenses. Appreciate the comp and the kind of the tech guidance. I guess just generally, those are moving, one's coming down, one's going up. I guess, did you think about total expenses for the year? Can you update us on your thoughts on an aggregate level? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think on an aggregate, if you compare our forecast for this fiscal year to last year, I think we're looking at about a 3% decrease overall in operating expenses, and that would be compensation, tech, op, G&A. It would exclude the sales distribution expense line. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much and certainly appreciate the streamlined process, it really is helpful on a day like today. Just maybe starting with capital deployment. I see that the repurchase did slow a little bit in the quarter, just sort of curious what drove that? Was that just timing, pricing? And then maybe stepping back a little bit, Greg, you had mentioned that you're a little bit behind the curve on Solutions, a little bit within the institutional channel, at least that was I think in your prepared commentary. Can you maybe dovetail together, whether that'd be a de novo solution or maybe possibly through acquisition? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Let me start with the capital question. This is Ken. So, there were a couple of things, price was a factor during the quarter. Also I think, maybe and probably one of the bigger drivers was buyable volume was down, and it was down 25% to 30% this quarter versus last. So, that had an impact as well. And then, you wanted... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I'll just add. On Solutions, it's really \u2013 I think, the integration of our multi-asset solutions into the rest of our equity teams and the reorganization that we just did reflects that and also reflects the importance of Solutions versus Alternatives, where we're breaking them out with two separate business heads. We'll continue to add where we think we can add value. AlphaParity, the recent acquisition last quarter, a small one, but it gives us more tools to customize within our Solutions group. But having someone who's run the Franklin Income Fund and our Hybrid group now heading up the Solutions group, I think really makes it a much more robust platform that's really integrated into the rest of the group. So, that's really what we're \u2013 I think the immediate changes that we're talking about. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And just one follow-up for me, and thanks for taking both questions today. You mentioned that global retail did a bit better this quarter. (07:24) in the U.S., that continues to struggle, at least from some of the Sim fund (07:26) data that we take a look at. I guess the big picture question I have is, you have much better performance, however, you're also seeing a pretty sizeable A, B and C share class, which seems to be out of phase just generally speaking at the industry level. How do you reconcile that? Do you think performance wins at the end of the day or is it more the structure has to change to leverage the performance? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think performance wins in the end. There's no question about that. And as we've said before, I mean it's \u2013 when you have a good quarter, a good year, it may slow redemptions a bit, but it takes a while to build back under the shelf space. And we've seen \u2013 I think the number of four and five star funds for us has quadrupled here in the last quarter. So, those are the things that really drive sales and shelf space. I think, all of us, on the \u2013 whether anybody \u2013 and that's most of the industry that has more brokerage assets, it, as we all know, creates challenges in the transition to more of the advisory model. And you have to look at your lineup and that's what we've been doing and kind of pruning funds and changing some things to adapt to that advisory model. But at the end of the day, if you have performance and you have reasonable fees, you'll get distribution in that model as well. But I think you're right to say that it's a little bit slower, the turnaround, than you'd seen just if it was all traditional brokerage. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Greg, maybe just another one on, I guess, sales inflow. So, you mentioned the momentum on the retail side in the quarter. When I look at the institutional and the VA, that part of the business, it sounds like you had one client that decided to stick with Franklin. And then, you guys are focused more on the Solutions kind of aspect. So, just wanted to get a sense on like how quickly \u2013 or how much work have you guys been doing, whether it's on the Solutions side, trying to figure out kind of the institutional variable annuity? I think last quarter you mentioned some new products on the variable annuity side to maybe offset some of the redemption pressures that you're seeing? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think when we look at the VA part of our business, and the assets today are about $44 billion, we'd put somewhere around $11 billion into the inactive side of the portion that \u2013 I'd put that at the higher risk for moving to passive, insurance companies that have gotten out of the VA business and are transitioning those. It was public that with one of those insurance companies that they are holding off on their plans to transition. That was one of the ones that we had indicated to you was probable in terms of redemption, redemption either last quarter or this quarter or over the next few quarters. And that was about $4.5 billion of the $11 billion in assets. The others we continue to work with, and some of them we have transitioned, as you said, with our Solutions, trying to come up with \u2013 whether it's low volatility products, we have built those. I mean, this isn't something that's new to us, but we continue to work on the active piece of the business and we see a lot of opportunity still. And hopefully, that's a number that instead of looking at a dwindling base, can be a growing base for us. So, it's not \u2013 and I think that's an important distinction. You just had a portion of that VA business that, because of the volatility and what happened with prepaid commissions, a lot of insurance companies got into a difficult situation, are looking for a solution to work through that. And that's really something we've been engaged and have accounts that exist today in those lower volatility funds. And so, hopefully, that's an area that can continue to grow. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, we spent a lot of time over the past year on DOL. Just wanted to shift to MiFID II, and just wanted to get your perspective. I know there's still a lot of kind of puts and takes until implementation and how things are going to kind of settle out. But I just wanted to get your view on how Franklin kind of looks at the regulations, particularly for the European side of the business? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. It's something that we continue to be very engaged on and \u2013 obviously, our Luxembourg-based CCAB is sold in, I think, more countries than any other one. So, we are very active on the lobbying front. And I think, the obvious main concern is around how we handle the unbundling on the research and brokerage side. And we're spending a lot of time doing that and we've been asking that question, well, what does it mean, what kind of dollar number are we looking at. And I think it's probably too early to say, because it depends just how clients react to this disclosure. For us, it's not just on the face of it, it's only two funds that really get affected directly by the MiFID legislation. And so, it wouldn't be a significant dollar hit to us. But again, when you have that transparency and the questioning, we don't know how far it extends and I wouldn't want to try to extrapolate, because we don't know that would mean. I think you're right in saying, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty on it. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Morningstar downgraded the parent company rating for your funds at the end of March, citing investment lineup and firm leadership. I guess, are there any indications that institutional consultants share these concerns? And are there parts of the Morningstar comments that you think may have even some remote merit, and are you making any changes to address the Morningstar comments? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I think it's a subjective analysis that probably based on flows with something that they led them to do that. I don't \u2013 there's not much you can do. It's not \u2013 we haven't gotten certainly any feedback from clients that it's a concern in any area. I mean, they have the relationships. They do their due diligence. They know us, they know our funds probably better than that analyst. So, I don't really \u2013 I think a couple of the comments they had were probably relevant that we are looking at. But it's not something that we got any feedback from the distribution side that this was an issue. It's not something that's really that focused on. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And it seems like there has been some movements in leadership and you've done some things around some \u2013 the acquisition of AlphaParity and some other reorgs. Maybe what sort of changes seem \u2013 there seem to be changes being made behind the scenes. Is anything \u2013 maybe you can talk about what's happening behind the scenes in terms of leadership changes? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, we just had the reorg that we announced, and there was some major changes just on, again, aligning people with where the priorities are for the firm and having a new role within Solutions, new role within Alternatives, new role within equities as a whole. The president consolidating many of the functions or reporting lines of the existing co-presidents model. So I mean, I think, that's a big change. And the other big change is, I've taken on the performance analytics; basically, your risk group reports directly to me, separate from the investment teams. And I think that that just speaks to the heightened awareness and importance of risk management for the firm. Having that kind of check built-in and I get that information directly, I think that's a fairly significant change as well. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick on the international gross sales. Really a solid improvement, I think which you highlighted in your prepared remarks pointing to flagship products driving the sales momentum. Was there anything specific as far as the products go? And was there any other components that contributed there that are worthy to note beyond just a general improved optimism or a reaction around the performance track record that's turned around? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's really Global Bond is the driver there, a major turnaround, and kind of the proven case that we've been talking about that if rates rise, this is the fund that can position your portfolio very nicely for that, and I think that, that proved itself in this last cycle. You look at the return numbers and first quartile for every time period, I mean, that certainly helps when you're having a fund that was in that redemptions. There are other areas that had inflows and certainly our Emerging Markets Fund had major inflows and continues to do very well. Our Floating Rate Fund, specifically in Korea, crossed $1 billion very quickly. So, those are new areas of distribution for us. And if we look across the globe, many markets that had been in redemptions have turned to positive. When you look at Hong Kong, Korea, India, Taiwan, Germany, all back in positive. So, I think that that's a very strong and good trend for us going forward. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Terrific. And then, is there any color, it was \u2013 while the gross sales picked up nicely, which is very encouraging. Obviously, stronger in international, but also picked up in the U.S. What is it that can get those redemptions to slow? Are there any particular trends that you're noticing that would give you encouragement that we might not be far away from that beginning to slow down? Is there any additional color you can give on the redemption side? Thanks. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think they are slowing and if you look at the numbers and \u2013 of course, we'd like to see them slow faster, but again, I think it's just a matter of performance sinking in and people recognizing this strong performance across the lineup right now. As we said earlier on the call, I mean, the transition from brokerage to advisory creates a little bit more of the lag effect and \u2013 or just more of a headwind in some of those redemptions in those A Class shares. But I think when we look at the trend right now, and of course, knock on wood, we don't like to lead anything, but certainly better right now what we're seeing and seeing some positive overall days for the firm, which we haven't seen in a while. So, hopefully that continues. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Terrific. Last question for me. Do you guys have any plans as far as maybe an offering in the \u2013 amongst these clean share sleeves that we've heard about, and what's your view on this type of a product and structure? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I think like everyone, it's something we are looking at and trying to figure out how we would buffer that and how it would affect our distribution channel. So, it is very much something that's certainly on the plate today. And we don't have any plans to announce any offering right now, but it is something that we think is very viable and something that I would put in the probable category at some stage. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : But probably too early to be discussing with distribution partners or anything like that, is that fair? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Right. I think we work together with the distribution partners to figure out what they need and the uncertainty of the rule is still pending. I think it's early to decide what those share classes are going to look, whether you need the T, whether you need a clean share class. All of that, I think, is still very much up in the air based on what happens with the fiduciary rule. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Fair enough. Thanks for the color. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, everybody. A question for you guys around the management fee rates. So, some of your products tend to be, and especially some of the larger ones on the higher end of things, and as I think about the growth in the advisory channel and your guys kind of market share within that part of the market, do you find your fees competitive enough to gain a larger share of the pie there, especially relative to some of the larger peers? And I guess ultimately, would you consider some of the fee reductions to accelerate growth in that channel? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think that's just part, again, of what I've said earlier that with this transition to advisory, we're looking at the entire lineup. And to me, you obviously have to be competitive on the fee side. I think we are. I think the areas where \u2013 I'm not sure what you're referring to where we're higher, because in most cases, we are lower than the average. And I think you have to look at the specific category and who you're competing with. But that's certainly something that if we feel like it's not competitive in the channel, that's something that a short-term hit we would take, if we had to. I don't \u2013 those are discussions we're having, we're looking at all of that, but more of the funds are on the lower end of fees. So, I think it'll continue to be well positioned. And I think the battle on fees, it's easy to sit there and think, well, I can just reduce and suddenly I'm competitive. But the reality is, when you're competing against passive, you better beat passive or make your value proposition clear, reducing your fees by 20 basis points doesn't change, if that advisor is moving a key amount of their assets to passive, reducing your fees only hurts your margin. And if you beat passive over the long run a 20-basis-point difference doesn't really matter. So, I think that that's the bigger question, is whether you believe active will beat passive, because trying to compete with passive on a fee basis is not the right answer. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. That all make sense. And then secondly, I was hoping you could touch on the institutional channel, understanding a couple of lumpy apples for you guys this quarter, good news on the VA stuff sticking around. But just bigger picture, any comments around the pipeline and the composition of the institutional pipeline for you guys? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I would say that the area that we've been talking about and continue to see more interest based on the last market cycle with rates coming up is just the institutions interested in local asset management currencies \u2013 currency funds with Global Bonds, we're seeing a lot of interest there and those can be larger accounts. We're seeing pretty good interest as well in the emerging market side. We're growing in the UK side as well, with some of the fixed income funds there on excellent performance. So, those would be some of the areas that \u2013 and global ag, we've had a couple of big wins and had a big win last quarter that will fund close to $1 billion this quarter. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Greg, if you could just comment a little bit about what you're seeing on the Department of Labor trends in terms of what your sales force is seeing with the advisors and your work with distribution partners. To what extent are advisors moving or you think they'll be moving product, shifting around more before June 9? Or is it more of a play of gee, let's see what happens? And then, just maybe your AUM that has 12b-1 fees, I know some distributors switching out of 12b-1? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think it's still like the future of the rule very much up in the air with how distribution's reacting. I think that it doesn't matter if you have a rule or not. The trend towards the advisory platforms is there and happening. And it's just a question of how quickly it accelerates and that's something that many of the major broker dealers favor. So, to sit back and say, well, I'm not going to react to that because of the uncertainty of the rule, I think it really doesn't matter. That trend is in place. I think, as we said earlier, around what it means in terms of share classes and the future, I mean, there are things that need to change with that rule. And I start with what are we trying to solve. And hopefully, it's something that the SEC \u2013 it gets pushed back to the SEC at some point to provide a workable rule that affects all distribution. I think if we feel like we need a rule, then that's the right place to have a rule. And this rule was highly political from the start, and things like private right of action I think need to be taken out of the rule, and having a more reasonable and workable best interest contract, I think, are the two things that we think need to change, if we indeed believe we have to have a rule. So, the future of how asset classes look, how brokerage accounts look, I think is still very much in the air in terms of what we have to price and that will all be probably worked out in the year ahead. But it's also somewhat challenging to get a common voice from the industry on what we need. So that's \u2013 I think that's one of the issues as well that people have different views and different needs on what that rule should indeed look like. The question around 12b-1, I mean, we have already share classes that exist without a 12b-1. So, that's \u2013 and some would obviously in advisory models use those. So, that's already there today. Isn't actually called (26:37) advisory class. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Are you seeing active substitution into the non-12b-1 shares within your account play (26:44)? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think the more \u2013 more of the advisory platforms, that's something they would use. So, yes. I mean, as that continues I think you'd see that. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then just on expenses, Ken, the 3% drop in expenses, a couple of questions around that. I guess what are your assumptions on performance fees is I think you said you still expect comp to be down 3% to 4% and it was a little elevated, I assume performance fees helped that this quarter. So, just maybe comment around your view of performance fees for the back half of the fiscal year in conjunction with the op expenses and just the base of that op expenses, is that the $2.042 billion base? I just want to make sure I have the right number there. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Let's start with performance fees. Well, I think, the performance fees this quarter and a little bit last quarter were for similar products a year ago. So, that was like the first time we had performance fees on those. I would not expect those particular performance fees to recur in the second half. But we do have performance fees typically in the second half of the year. What they'll be I'm not sure, but I would just go back and look at what we've had in previous third and fourth quarters and \u2013 because performance is picking up. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And in the expense base, just the 3% drop, the fiscal year, just want to make sure I'm doing it off of the right base of expense. Ex-sales distribution, of course... Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Yeah. Yes. Two point, sorry, last year was about $2 billion, right? Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I just want to make sure I have all the one-timers that are there. So, is it $2.04 billion or is there... Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. If memory serves, that's correct. Yeah. And you could also \u2013 for kind of the more granular questions and answers here you could also feel free to call our IR department, Brian, should be able to help you out with that. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thank you. Two clarifications. First, one on the whole large insurer not replacing dozens of actively managed funds. Just specific, is it related to the lawsuit and what I'm getting at is, is should we think of this as a temporary stay and these funds could be at risk at some point or there was a decision of this is where we're going to be and we can consider the 4.6 base? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I don't have the answer. I mean I think the reaction is, they're going to stay put for now and assess it, may take a different tack. I mean I'd still think you always put it at the at risk. It's just we don't know today and their decision is to hold off for now on moving that to passive. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Fair enough. And then your other point, on the key distributor transitioning from advisory to a sub-advisory program. Is that just them sub-advising out? Has that part (30:14) was most curious because some of the assets were in funds that performance has gotten a lot better. I'm just curious on what's behind the move? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. They don't \u2013 I think they would say that it's not related to performance. It's really just the concentration of assets that they've had in those funds and they built their own sub-advisory platform and moved a lot of assets from a lot of top performing funds into those other funds. So, it was never an issue of performance. It was just a build the fund family and had a fair concentration in a lot of different funds. And this was one way to handle that. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Got you. So, it's not actually something that we should look for as a trend hopefully. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, it better \u2013 no, I don't think so. I think for now I hope it's \u2013 I hope that's it. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : I'm with you. Last one, always tough to get too much out of you on this. But just curious going on $10 billion of cash and equivalents, is there any different sense of urgency on, I'll leave it really open in saying do something with that or are we like we're so close to tax reform now, and now we wait. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No. I think the \u2013 it's still \u2013 I think the way we would look at tax reform is if we find something before repatriation that we can save 15% on buying offshore, that's still going to be very attractive. So, I think it \u2013 you could argue that it certainly makes it more interesting with the cash in the meantime before you repatriate to look at things offshore, and we continue to do that. I mean it \u2013 like I've said in past ones, every moment we're looking at something. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thanks for all that, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. I missed the response on this one, but how much 12b-1 fee AUM do you have remaining? And do you include load (32:22) in this bucket too? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. We'd have to get that for you. I don't have that here, but it would still be the majority of the assets. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then, can you provide some commentary behind if Global Bond and Franklin Income were removed from recommended list and platforms generally last year after their underperformance and if you've seen them getting added back this year and any kind of tangible data points would be helpful too. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I think that's part of the \u2013 the challenge is that, that when you have a strong rebound and somebody made that decision to take them off, that they're going to be a little hesitant to put it right back on. So, you need a little bit of time. But, again, I look at the sales trends and certainly income fund now as a fund, and last quarter it was actually in positive sales despite Hybrid being somewhat negative. But that's a huge turnaround from where it was. And Global Bond had its lowest redemptions in over 10 quarters. So, behavior is changing despite whether or not you're on a recommended list and that performance does trickle down to the advisor level regardless of whether you are on a focus list or not. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Greg. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just to clarify something you said earlier. I think you said you've had some positive days which hasn't happened in a long time, is that in April or was that already happening in the first quarter? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It's in April. And, again, we don't like to \u2013 think I'm just mentioning it because I think it certainly feels better for everyone, the company to see that trend and whether or not that continues, I think is always what the market does in the near term. But, that's clearly a positive sign for us, a green shoot. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Sure. And then there's a $1 billion mandate you know of coming in, in global ag? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. It's the $900 million, $900 million. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Yeah. Okay. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Exaggerated slightly. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : All right. And last one's on the repurchase. I think you said something about buyable volume, but your volume was actually up in the first quarter. So, could you give us some more color around the lower repurchase rate? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Right. So, you have to \u2013 when I say buyable volume, I am talking about something called 10b-18 volume, which is the \u2013 our metric and what we can buy. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Thank you. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And, again, if you wanted to know more about that, feel free to call IR after the call. Operator : Thank you. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: That's a little technical issue there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks. Just a follow-up question on potential M&A opportunities. When you guys think about what's out there, and what your needs are internally at Franklin, do you guys feel like you need to do things mainly in line with your core competency, so active management? Or would you be willing to step out from that say, either in passive management or something maybe even adjacent to asset management? Just trying to get an understanding if there's sort of a governing philosophy to how you're thinking about deals here. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think, it's always \u2013 the philosophy is trying to figure out what the needs are of clients and how we can strengthen our offerings. And, obviously, the big change now and that everybody is talking about is, how you look at data and whether it's kind of the big data analytics, artificial intelligence. There's a lot of new companies, a lot of new interesting things happening there. So, that's certainly an area that we are spending time on, understanding and figuring out how \u2013 whether it's a direct investment, a JV, or building your own, how we can use information today to help our active teams, or build a separate one that could be completely different from our traditional. So, I think, as any large asset manager, that's certainly an area today with the super computing capabilities and the amount of data real-time, documenting behavior real-time, it's something that every asset manager I think needs to be at least aware and looking at. So, that would be an area. We don't have, if a large passive manager came up, and I just don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but it would certainly be something we would look at as well. I don't think we have any hard rules on, philosophically that we have to be this or that. I think, it's hey, if our clients \u2013 we know passive's here to stay. We know that it works very well with active. It works very well with alternatives and other capabilities that we have. And the more we can package all that together through our solutions is something \u2013 that's really our long-term vision is trying to build out all of those capabilities. So I don't think that the philosophy of saying you're an active manager precludes you from doing anything and there's all forms of active using passive through solutions and that's really where we think that the market is going. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great, thanks. And thanks for your patience, taking all the questions. We've talked a lot about different fund share classes and advisory business, but we haven't really talked too much about the SMA business, which is clearly in a lot of your U.S. distribution outlets a sizeable and growing business. So, and maybe some of your strategies like Global Bond and Franklin Income don't translate as well. But can you talk a little bit about your presence in the SMA business, and do you feel that you have the right product suite there? Is that a place you're putting more emphasis on incremental growth? Just trying to get a better feel for your positioning there. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I mean, it's a business that we have been servicing and building and going after, so nothing's new there. It's still a relatively smaller proportion of our business. And I think with advisory, with the move towards advisory becomes less significant in many ways. I think the challenge is how \u2013 the compression of pricing within those models and how that reconciles with your other funds is always somewhat of a challenge in how you enter that business when you're competing with firms that may not have other retail funds, pricing differently than what they're doing in the SMA world. So it's an area that's going to be still significant and important. But I don't think there's anything new that I'm aware of in that channel that changes our thinking. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And, I mean, just within your franchise, I mean is that a $20 billion asset business, $30 billion, $10 billion? I'm just trying to get a sense of how meaningful it is a contributor to kind of your sales and flows. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. We'll get back to you on that one because I don't have the exact number. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It's pretty small though. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It's pretty small. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And... Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: (40:07) maybe less. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. $10 billion maybe. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Maybe less. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up. I'm just curious for your perspective, I mean one of your peers or competitors has filed for kind of, I won't call it a new pricing scheme, fulcrum fees has been around. But, clearly, have taken a view that something has to change with mutual fund pricing dynamics. So, just kind of interested in your \u2013 just in general your thoughts around some of those initiatives you've seen a competitor take and if you think there's much merit to it or just kind of your perspective? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think the more options you have on pricing, the better. I think if you believe that actives can outperform, the client probably will end up paying more for performance fee. But, certainly, something that we have been open to more on the institutional side where we've done some pricing with performance fees with lower expense rate or lower management fees on them. That's something we've been doing. We're looking at it in the retail space as well. And, I think, that clearly with such focus and pressure on fees today, paying out of your alpha probably makes more and more sense. So, that is something that we are open to and looking at. And if clients prefer that, then that's something that we have to adapt our model to. So, I think we are open and we think we will see more of that. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just as industry assets continue moving into the fee-based advisory channel, just curious how you think about your vehicle delivery today for active management, certainly you have lot of legacy A, B, C mutual fund share classes out there. Can you just talk about how you're evolving your vehicle delivery, so the mutual fund vehicle itself is not a barrier for investors to buy active management, how you're thinking about going beyond the mutual fund vehicle? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, again, I mean, we look at \u2013 our core competency is the management of those assets, so the vehicle is dictated more by the channels and how technology evolves and how we can weather it, an ETF with \u2013 using an active bucket in that. I mean, those are things like everyone in the industry again we're looking at. And if that is a vehicle that's lower cost and something the clients want, then we're certainly open to doing that. And it's just a matter of working with our clients, our advisors and understanding what they need in their channel and moving towards that. So, I don't \u2013 again, we don't have any preference whether it's an SMA vehicle or an ETF or a 40 Act mutual fund. It's whatever the clients prefer and meets their needs. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And just on the SMA, do you feel like you have enough of the capabilities yourself today or is that something you feel like you need to built out more to be a little bit larger within that sort of vehicle delivery? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think we've certainly \u2013 and there's a lot of overlap on \u2013 we've built out our internal consulting group within our sales and marketing teams and a lot of that overlaps with what happens on the SMA side too, and really creating a more institutional process and service model. That's been the big focus for us over the last five years, so that suits the SMA account as well. But as I said before, it's just not a large part of the business today, but one that we certainly are servicing. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify something. We did do just a quick run on Morningstar and we got a little over $300 billion of mutual fund AUM with 12b-1 fees. I just want to see if that was in the ballpark for capturing all of that properly? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: That sounds right. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just on the fee rate picked up this quarter on ex-performance fees, so just was wondering, obviously, there's a mix shift between the asset classes but even within some of the asset classes we've seen some improvement in fees. I wonder \u2013 just wondering if there's \u2013 if that's all due to mix or were there any sort of one-time-ish elements that (44:53). Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It was predominantly due to mix. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just of mix. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Johnson, there are no further questions. I'll turn the floor back to you for any final remarks. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, thank you, everybody for participating on the call. We look forward to speaking next quarter, and have a nice weekend. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Rob and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, good morning and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. With me is Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased with this quarter's results as flow trends improved, performance remained strong, and operating income increased. Our international retail business continued to gain traction as solid performance drove demand for many products globally. We implemented a new commentary format this quarter and we hope you found it useful and we welcome any additional feedback you have. I'd now like to open up the line to your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. In the pre-commentary, I read like the unusual items in G&A made it lower than it should be. If that's right, could you help us better understand the disclosure in the Q in terms of, I guess, what you consider the net amount of the unusual item impact? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sure. I don't know that it was lower than it should be, but \u2013 and there were some \u2013 I would say, the net of the one-offs were maybe just $2 million, in that very small neighborhood. But I think, more importantly, what the question is going forward, what do we see? We do see a little upward pressure on that line item and some of the other line items, offset probably by the comp line item, which that compensation was a little bit high this quarter than run rate. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Then more broadly, there was some chatter last quarter about a wirehouse trying to force revenue share, kind of, across the board as they become compliant with DOL. What has your experience been on that front? And do you think it is settling out better or worse than maybe what you are paying before the DOL rule? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, we can only pay the limit in the prospectus, so that has created, I think, in some cases, a protracted discussion on how we get to a standard number. But I can't think of any case where we have not been able to work it out. And, again, it's maximum by prospectus, so it shouldn't increase with the changes. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. In terms of international equities, it's still a meaningful source of outflows. If it was just the U.S., the asset class, it's the one that seems to be working the best. So can you talk about your global equity business? If possible, give us a little more color on the continued weakness, really, in the gross inflows. Is there, sort of, region or client type? Or can you help us point us to maybe why that weakness, or why we're seeing this weakness compared to \u2013 like, prior to 2016, it seemed like that gross sales rate was at a more normal level. Thanks. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I think that that is an area that we were hoping would turn around a little bit faster based on the performance. I think just a general statement first, just looking at the overall flows on global equity and, obviously, that was an area where we had over $6 billion in outflows. $3 billion of that was due to three accounts on the institutional side; the largest, a sovereign wealth fund, not performance-related but just reducing for cash needs there. And I still think getting back to the gross levels in any equity category is difficult, looking historical when you still have the pressure of indexing happening and replacing the traditional fund. But we have \u2013 the Foreign Fund has turned around to positive flows for the last two quarters. That's much better than where it was, but that category's not as large as the overall global equity category, and that's the important one that we need to see turn around for the Templeton Growth Fund. So we, I think that the \u2013 and also part of the \u2013 still the value growth side and some of the headwinds there, but Templeton, for the first time, is getting a little bit of benefit from currencies, which we haven't had and that trend continues. And, obviously, the bigger positions in Europe and financials have helped quite a bit, too. So if you look back, we just got improvement in our star, the number of stars on those funds, and so it takes a little bit of time and, certainly, in the retail channel to get back to the kind of positioning you had, and that's really what we've been trying to do. And if the performance trends continue, we'll be successful there. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Any color on some of the non-U.S. parts of global? You've got a Korean business, you've got some business in India, like there's definitely different pockets outside the U.S. Is there anything there that is contributing to kind of what we're seeing as you aggregate the global equity AUM in commentary? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I think as I said before, I mean, I think certain markets get lost in the numbers, and if you just look at, for example, the India business at $800 million in net inflows for the quarter, very strong relative and organic growth there. Taiwan, $0.5 billion in inflows there. Germany, very strong as well. Asia, as a whole, about $2.2 billion last quarter inflows. So those are probably the standout countries in terms of where we're seeing good retail and institutional flows. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just one more. A number of competitors cutting fees to hopefully drive better sales. To what extent do you think reducing fees would help you either in international equities since you've just been talking about that or maybe more broadly across different areas of the firm? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think that's the big question for many firms. It's very hard for everybody to be in the lowest quartile of expenses. It's also very hard to compete with just straight market beta at two, three basis points. So if you can reduce from 50 to 30 and you're losing business to two or three, that's probably not a great decision. I think what we've tried to do is look at every category. We're doing that right now, working with our distribution partners and finding out if any asset classes that we have that are being priced out of the market that have competitive performance and that pricing is an issue. I think most of our funds are on the lower side so we don't see that, but there are some that we think we probably will reduce. I don't think there's anything from a substantial impact at this stage, but like many, if the pricing side of the equation is much more important and you have to be competitive and that may mean some near-term revenue loss to continue to get share, and we've been doing really a review that we're in the middle of and are getting closer to probably reducing a few funds. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Again, just on some of the expense guidance that you gave, you mentioned just in comp that there was some severance. I don't know if you can size that just so we kind of get a better run rate? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: The were some nonrecurring items but also I think something important to keep in mind is due to the performance of the company and the increasing average assets under management, et cetera, we took a look at some of the variable comp components and adjusted our estimates of our liability there. In this quarter and since it's the third quarter of fiscal year, you pretty much have the whole year impact of that adjustment in this current quarter, so that had the effect of inflating the quarterly number a little bit. So that's something to keep in mind. Overall, as I said in the commentary, I think when you look at the comp line year 2017 versus 2016, we're looking at that to be down around 2% to 2.5%. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then, Greg, just as a follow-up, just given a lot of the industry changes and trends that we're seeing, you guys have done some to try to \u2013 whether it's expand distribution, diversify products with K2 and ETFs, anything changing \u2013 I don't know \u2013 the outlook in terms of cash use and doing more on the M&A side. I guess, particularly just on the product side because I guess on the distribution, you guys have a lot. But just wanted to get your thoughts. Just given that we are seeing a lot of industry changes, if anything is changing in terms of priority of the cash? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I mean, I don't think anything has changed as far as priorities. I think we're always looking to add strong investment teams that complement the lineup. I think, obviously, in the alternative space, we've talked about why that's not always easy to do. I think we'd like the high-net-worth and Fiduciary Trust, that business to grow so that's something that would move up the list on priorities for us. But overall, we continue to be very active in looking at everything and I wouldn't say the list has changed from what we've talked about before. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Generally, we've heard from some other of your peers about uptick in expenses and spend. And so, Ken, I wanted to get just kind of a thought around kind of the longer-term expense profile as you kind of start looking into next year, how we should think about maybe some initiatives that are going to be coming online, whether they're tech or other investments and how that might mean for the overall kind of expense outlook. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sure, sure. So we are just starting our annual budget process so it is a little early for me to give you any definitive guidance with a lot of confidence. But I can tell you that we're really taking a hard look leaving no stone unturned, looking for ways that we can harvest expense savings to fund those new strategic initiatives. I could say, overall, from what I know today, I mean, it is looking like it will be a challenge next year to reduce next year's expense levels from the current levels. But beyond that, it's kind of too early to tell exactly, but I'll definitely have more for you next time we meet. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And just a follow up, Greg, on some of the international comments and success in retail. Obviously, the Global Bond seems like it's a big driver of that, but are there other products underneath that are seeing some of the benefits of the improvement in the broader kind of international retail segments? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think the other standouts in the last couple of quarters on the fixed income side \u2013 I mean, obviously, Global Bonds, it's a tremendous turnaround from where we were, where we had $2 billion in inflows for that category, where a year ago we probably had $7 billion, $8 billion in outflows, so we're certainly pleased to see that that's turned around. The other areas, the floating rate was very strong and it's a little choppier because some of it, we get some institutional accounts in that, but especially as rates ticked up, that category, we've seen momentum, certainly in Asia. One of the big headwinds was Asia growth. That's turned around just as far as actually redemptions, and performance is very strong there. And the other one that has been a drag would be emerging markets, but very strong performance continues despite even growth outperforming value, but those funds have been well positioned through that. So those would be the areas that we're seeing strong interest outside of the U.S. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess the question I have is on the distribution front. I mean, as you've expanded your product range, obviously, there's the EPS (14:43) initiative and other products. I mean, there's only so many things you can kind of fit through any pipe, so to speak, and I don't get a sense that there's a lot of \u2013 you may trim your product line every now and then with small, underperforming things, but how do you kind of manage all these new initiatives, and getting in through your distribution and without kind of... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Cannibalizing... Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah, cannibalizing your existing products? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think that's the question we wrestle with quite a bit, and to Ken's earlier points on some of the initiatives and funding that we need to do. Take distribution and ETFs, we probably need to continue to build out our ETF specialists and not rely on the existing retail wholesalers. And I think that's something that we've been out telling the story, but really feel like that's going to require a separate effort. Now there would be alternatives and supporting that group versus just having a generic institutional sales group. I think the specialization in distribution is becoming more and more important, especially as there's more gatekeepers that expect that expertise and closeness with the portfolio management team. So that'd be another area that we think we're going to continue to make an incremental investment in. Because I think you're absolutely right, you cannot rely on one platform to sell all different products and have that same kind of credibility in the market. We think that more specialization is required. That's an investment we've been making on the retail side as well, in building out more consultants and even bifurcating our sales teams for different types of advisors in the field, even in the same territory. So I think that the bar is being raised and we have to continue to specialize and focus the distribution efforts. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. And then maybe just a follow up on a capital question. I mean, I know every quarter, I believe, in the Q, you highlight the amount of your cash and investments that you have kind of set aside for regulatory and operational needs. And I don't remember the precise number, but it's roughly $3 billion or so. I mean, should we think of that as kind of the minimum that you kind of think you need on an operational basis? Or is it really kind of somewhat higher than that just because you might have other cash just in the event of transactions? Just trying to get a sense of what you feel is like your kind of your bottom-line can never go below this type number? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Okay. I'll try to answer that question. I didn't hear all the parts of your question, but I think I got the main idea. So right, so in our filings, we do highlight the minimum amount of cash in the U.S. and outside the U.S. that we feel we need for internal purposes, things that might come up, regulatory issues, amounts to cede, (17:56) new products, et cetera. The U.S. cash is approximately like $2.3 billion of that number. I think we \u2013 say, we have $800 million that we going to hold aside for operational and regulatory requirements, and international, that's 6.3 and of that we hold about 2.2. So, I think your number of $3 billion is about right, and I think your characterization is also correct. That is the amount that we think we would need, kind of bare minimum, to have on hand. Keeping in mind also, though, that if we needed more money, we have the ability to borrow more money. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And maybe just one last question. I believe you have some debt that's maturing pretty soon. Should we expect that you do pay that off? Or look to just kind of refinance that? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: The debt. Yeah, we do have debt maturing in September, and I think because of our strong financial position we have the ability to be opportunistic in what we do. Like I said... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And I think we'd add just, it also depends on the tax repatriation and how that shapes in the next few months based on what we would do there. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And that's definitely a factor that we're considering. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Hi. Good morning, guys. I think in the prepared remarks you guys highlighted some institutional wins. I think it was roughly $2 billion on the international side. Can you elaborate a little more, I guess, which products that's coming in from? And anything else you're aware on the positives and the negative side on the institutional front so far in the quarter? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think, first of all, it was very quiet from the standpoint of funding for the quarter, there were no significant one-time separate accounts coming in during the quarter, but we do have \u2013 we had some wins during the quarter that are funding now in this quarter, and that's what we mentioned it was $2 billion. And I believe most of that is in Fixed Income, Emerging Markets, Global Bonds and in the Global Bond category, most of that $2 billion. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. A couple of cleanup questions. I guess when we look at the fee rate, it looks like it's slipped out a little bit sequentially, just wondering given the fact that the global products just from a beta have done obviously better, and the currency probably were maybe a little bit more helpful. Just surprised we didn't see a bit of an improvement there. So maybe just peeling back the layers kind of what's going on, and the outlook for kind of the fee rate given where the business is today. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Could you repeat the question? Especially the first part. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sorry. Just on the fee rate, excluding performance fees, if you just look at the management fee rate, looks like it's slipped out a little bit sequentially. So I'm just curious whether it's a mix or it's a currency issue or something like that? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think there's anything noteworthy to call out there. Performance fees weren't that much this quarter really, and I think it's just a function of mix really other than anything structural. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just the last question. As we look out into 2018, with MiFID II obviously many of your competitors kind of commented on what they think the implication could be on the business given you're obviously a large global footprint. Just curious how you guys are thinking about it? And any incremental expenses we need to be thinking about related to MiFID II into 2018. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I think the question, obviously, around the unbundling and what does that mean, and I think, like everyone, we're still very much studying it and have a group committed to doing that. I think if it's narrow in terms of how it's implemented, it wouldn't have a very large impact on us. If it becomes more of a standard across the rest of the globe, obviously, we'll have a bigger one, and I wouldn't even want to estimate, at this stage, what that would look like. I think, overall, as far as the regulations and complying with them and having new clean share classes in place, we are ready to do that and in compliance, and I don't see any real issues just aside from the unbundling and the uncertainty, and we know some have decided to pay for research directly, and that's something that we have not made a decision on one way or another right now. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe switching over to DOL, Greg, just your views on sort of the current tempo there given that we've obviously pushed out to the June implementation deadline and now maybe your views on where you think the best interest contract exemption ends up, and what you're hearing from advisors on their view on allocation between active and passive. And then sort of in conjunction with the comments you made earlier on the revenue share, are you seeing sort of pressure on your share classes there? Or do you think development clean shares will follow out of those problems? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: That's a lot of questions in one. I think, first of all, with DOL, we're in a comment period. It's a little bit quiet right now. People drafting responses to both the SEC and the DOL. Our sense is that the two now are talking and have been public in trying to work together. So our view is that the January 1 date will be pushed back. That'll be the goal, I think, of most in the industry to try to give time to have a thoughtful overall standard developed with the two groups. And in terms of the BIC, in the best interest contract, I think having some level of higher suitability will probably be the outcome but not be as onerous as having a contract in place that creates issues. And then having the private right of action and some of the weaknesses in the current structure, we think that will be addressed in the future as well. And you also have momentum on the legislative front to do away with it completely. So I think that's still a possibility. But I think the more probable is the delay and then the two groups working to coming up with a workable standard. And I think everybody needs to go back and start with why are we doing this in the first place and then come up with an appropriate solution to that. On the active/passive, no matter what the DOL, where this all comes out, you have a move towards fee-based and you have to think about how that affects your business, affects your line up, puts pressure on expenses as there's more pressure around what the advisor is charging around that portfolio. So I think that that pressure continues one way, we'll continue regardless of where the DOL rule goes. And we talked about that earlier, just making sure your funds are competitive for as these platforms are narrower than the traditional one and may have a third or half of the funds available that were there before. So you have to be competitive on both the expense side and the return side there. Revenue share, I think that's still probably one that has more uncertainty about where it ends up in the future. Some large advisors are adopting a no-revenue stance. Some are \u2013 have revenue sharing in, some are going to adopt clean share. So I think that'll \u2013 the market forces, where that prevails, I think it's too early to tell but I think it's going to be a difficult world where one adopts a clean share and another doesn't. So I think that that's more of a probable outcome over time that you'll move towards that clean share class. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Okay. Great. And then just a big picture question on the M&A environment, just for the industry I guess. As you think about active performance generally has improved this year so far, do you see that fostering consolidation because the conditions have improved from a large manager consolidation perspective? Or do you think that actually creates a dynamic where there is less pressure on major players to consolidate? And how do you guys view yourselves as potentially merging with another big asset manager versus looking for more sort of small tuck-in acquisitions? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I don't think that there's been any kind of shift between active/passive and how a large firm thinks of their business in terms of probability of consolidating. It's very hard to just say, well, put two big firms together and not hurt each of your businesses as you combine the two. So I think the other \u2013 the real story is on the small to medium and how, in this environment, the traditional \u2013 say you're a niche-active equity manager, the investment you need to make to be competitive and to stay on platform. As I mentioned, the narrowing of funds, the availability, and some of that's based on the size in the system, and because there are costs to have diligence and follow X number of funds, it's just harder and harder for the smaller player. Where they may have had relationships out in the field with specific offices, or branches, or whatever, it's just going to be hard for them to get the shelf space when it's channeled through one central gatekeeper. So I think there's going to be more opportunities for those type of firms that have seen assets decrease, don't have the balance of fixed income and other categories that will need to sell or consolidate or become part of a bigger platform. But I think the larger firms being forced is more of a bear-market deal than it is an active/passive question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. It's great. Thanks very much. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much and I still have a bit of laundry list of questions for you. So first question, just going into the \u2013 fleshing out the expense dynamic a little bit. Just sort of wondering where you think you could still harvest some savings from as you think about next year? Because many of your peers are showing some pretty substantial year-on-year growth of expenses, even those that are very efficient themselves, and I say that as I look at your gross sales, which are relatively flattish, and by both region as well as I think by most asset classes. So how do you sort of jumpstart growth here? And do you need to sort of deepen the spend to get there? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I'll handle the expense side of that. You know, as I said, I guess my comment was, no stone unturned. I think you are exactly right. It is getting more challenging to find expense savings because we are efficient. Our competitors are efficient as well. We do have, I think, a competitive advantage there with our presence in the low-cost jurisdictions, where we can do more investments in technology and things like that at a lower cost. So I think that is something that differentiates us. But in terms of specific areas that we're looking at, it could be just things that \u2013 procedures and processes that we set up a long time ago for a specific business model. The business model has changed, so we're just questioning ourselves, do we need to do that process, or do we need \u2013 has business changed, where we could perhaps approach the problem differently. So things like that. I can't give you a specific quick hit list of things, which implies that changes will take a little bit of time to identify, and then to execute on them, but I still think there are opportunities in the organization to do that. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Okay. And then, just maybe... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And then, Bill... William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Go ahead. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Your question was what, on growth and jumpstarting what? William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. I mean, to me, it looks like \u2013 just to expand on my thought, it looks like your net sales, your gross \u2013 your redemptions were the driver to sort of the reduction for the most part sequentially in terms of the net outflows. And when I look at your gross sales, the good news is they've stabilized from where you were, maybe two, three quarters ago, but sort of flattish at the margin. And so, I guess I see some mix performance trends, good positioning outside the United States. You talked about pricing a little bit, which I want to come back to. So how do we think about really jumpstarting the growth on the gross sales side? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at just international, that a year ago was $6.5 billion in gross and its run rate now was 12.5 for the last quarter, so you can see that there has been a jumpstart there, and, again, many, many, very strong stories in a lot of regions and countries around the globe. I think the U.S., it's just been a much more difficult environment, where you would be seeing in a normal environment a pickup in those numbers, but because of what's happening in some of the transitions in the industry that we're all too familiar with, it's been harder to get the kind of rebound. And it also, as I mentioned before, I think the key areas for us in jumpstarting, I mean, obviously the Global Bonds you get a little move in rates up and you saw how quickly that can change perception, being one of the few in that category that actually can show that it's done very well in a rising rate environment. I still think that that probability is real despite the consensus view that rates have to stay low and down. We think it's one of the few real flagships that's well positioned for that. The Income Fund has had a huge rebound in performance. I'd say that's the one that hybrid category in a normal environment would be doing much better than it is, and kind of treading water right now, and part of that again is just due to some of the changes in the industry. I think that the outside of that, we've had a history of innovation and doing new things, and I think when you say jumpstart, we think we have a lot of exciting things that, as Ken mentioned, that may require a little bit more investment, but that we think can jumpstart organic growth as well. And part of that is around the ETF side, the alternatives with K2 and the KMAP initiative, having a platform for distribution, those are the kinds of things that could jumpstart growth in the near-term. And then I think there's been a lot of discussion around data and how we look at that and that's another area like many in our industry, and we think we're uniquely positioned with the Silicon Valley presence and relationships that our teams have here with technology companies and our India presence to do some exciting things there. So I think there's always \u2013 there's always going to be opportunities for new ideas in growth, and we've got many that we think are very exciting. But in the near-term, it's really making sure that we're well positioned with these changes in the U.S. retail and getting as much shelf space as possible and retaining assets as they transition from brokerage to advisory. And the next question will be, what does that mean? What's the number? And I don't think any of us know that, but we want to capture as much as we can in that transition and that's really why the retail side, you just haven't seen the more normal rebound for the industry in flows. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just one quick follow-up, thanks for taking all the questions. You mentioned that you're reviewing some of your pricing. Could you quantify the amount or dollar size of AUM that are at risk for the change? Risk may not be that word. And then where you are relative to peers in that re-pricing? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I mean, first of all, as I stated before, I mean, we've always been on the lower side of expenses, and I think having gone through every fund in the last few months, I'm encouraged by where many of them do stand. There's a few outliers that we're looking at right now, and it's really weighing, like anyone, what the revenue impact and how distribution feels, that \u2013 how does this contribute to redemptions and how does it contribute to sales and modeling that out and understanding what we need to do in the near-term versus the long-term. And those are hard decisions but most of our \u2013 again, I would say all of our large categories are in pretty good shape as far as the expense ratios versus peers. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for taking all the questions. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Why do you guys think that institutional sales outside the U.S. aren't doing a little bit better? I know you've got a mandate that you're getting ready to fund but it just seems to me that it's a pretty wide disparity between the recovery we're seeing on the retail side of the business, institutional, and just not clear. Why that's the case? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think the institutional, it's hard to \u2013 you get the \u2013 it's a little bit chunky and hard to kind of just look at and get any sense as to what the trend is based on quarterly numbers. And I think it was an unusual quarter in that you didn't have any significant findings for that. But as we've said, I mean, $2 billion coming in and that's I think was offshore institutional relationships that we feel like the interest is very strong on local currency, Global Bonds, Emerging Markets Bonds and we hope that that trend continues. But it is, you get $1 billion here, you get \u2013 it's just large chunky and hopefully this quarter will be a lot better than last quarter there. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And just bigger picture, what are your general expectations for your ETF initiative? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: As we stated before, I mean, it's a new line, you're not coming out and just coming with a low-cost passive, you're coming with smart beta and factors. And that's an education process that requires time, and we're committed to the business, we built a very strong team, and we continue to thoughtfully build that out. We just kicked off our Canadian ETFs, we're looking at Europe next. We know it's going to be an important part of our business over time, but like many initiatives we don't come out and state how big it has to be within a certain period to be successful. We're operating them. We want to make sure that we know what we're doing first. And I think we feel pretty confident that we have the right team and resources and we're going to continue to build out the distribution side. But like any new product, it takes time to get on the platforms, and we've certainly been pleased over the last year as we've been out in the market for over a year that we're now getting on the major platforms. So, hopefully, that'll give some momentum on the retail side. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the institutional side. You noted that you have a new head of U.S. institutional. I wonder if you can just share just at the highest level what they'll be charged with doing. It doesn't include a broader fixed income build. Just curious from the top down, why the move? And what they're charged with? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think they're charged with raising institutional assets. That's pretty straightforward. But this person comes with a very strong background with consultants and so that's going to be very important. It's also very important to work with our teams in making sure that the process and how we articulate the process to the institutions is right. And I think that that partnership is something that we would hope this person would continue to build on, and I think that's going to help us on the retail side as well as the gatekeeper, as all of that, I think, becomes very intertwined in how we talk about what we do with investment management team. So that person will take some time in looking at what we're doing and how we're doing it and probably have some input on some changes there as well. But it's just bringing in more experience to a team, and I think the overall business will benefit from that kind of talent. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : I know it bugs you a little bit in the past about it, but with such a great retail fixed income platform, would their responsibilities potentially include, if this client feedback is there, the consultant feedback is there, a broader institutional platform, on the fixed income side, specifically? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think we are open again, as you know, to anything, and I think that person having that experience there and looking at what we do, we'd certainly listen to that if that was something that we feel we need to do. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Switching gears. I saw that Cryer versus Franklin got class status this week. I mean, I personally have strong opinions that the case won't hold water, and you can't be judged versus a passive fee on every product you put in the funds. But actually that's not the question. The question I have on that is, does a case like this making class status have the ability to influence behavior in the retirement channel in general and make people risk averse and just toss in the towel and go passive as much as that might be a terrible move? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I don't think so. I mean I think this is an example of, to me, why the DOL rule is weak in its current state, that just extrapolate all these suits times every retirement plan. It's a trial lawyer's dream to have that, and our belief is that this case has no merit. Just about every firm has been sued that has their own funds in their own offering. So we're going to fight it and like you said, I think we believe that we're on the right side and did all the right things. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah, while I'm with you there. Last one is a tiny one on buyback. I heard all your comments on cash. Does a broader buyback get hold up on waiting on tax reform and repatriation specifically? Because use of funds kind of matters of whether or not you get to return the cash or not. There's a lot of people that would like to see a bigger buyback. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, I think, certainly, not in the short-term. If there is some tax reform that might have some impact, we'd have to wait and see the details of what that tax reform is. But in the short-term, I don't expect us to change our thinking on share repurchases. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So more in line with current levels? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, from the current levels. I'm sorry; I didn't hear that last part. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Said more in line. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. All right. Yeah. Thanks very much. I'm good. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thank you. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to the M&A point. Just curious how you're thinking about prioritizing waiting for clarity on repatriation and the potential tax reform? What sort of impact does that have in terms of on your thinking for doing a deal? And then just I know in the past you had greater preference, it sounded like, for institutional and non-U.S. potential properties. Just how are you thinking about M&A today to improve your longer-term positioning to drive growth? What type of properties could make sense as you're thinking about it now? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I'd say that it doesn't really impact the thinking now. I think the earlier \u2013 well, you have offshore cash. I mean, I think the probability is you'll have a territorial system in some form. You'll be taxed on your earnings \u2013 not your cash, but your earnings in the past. So it doesn't matter if we use the cash for offshore acquisitions versus waiting to bring it back. You're going to pay a tax based on what you earned in those offshore to free up the existing cash. So that creates kind of a level playing field as you look at the world, and I don't think it precludes us at this stage from favoring U.S. or saying, well, we'd have to finance a U.S. today versus not. I think if it makes sense, we would do it in the U.S. equally versus the rest of the world. I don't know if that helps, but that's based on where we are with the taxes. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just any thoughts on potential properties on the M&A front, how you're thinking about that, broadly? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I think I mentioned it earlier that there's no high priority. We look at where we can complement the lineup, so maybe, if anything, continuing to build out the high net worth business with fiduciary would move up that list today versus anything else. But we have, like always, many active \u2013 we're in many \u2013 doing diligence at any given time on different firms. Have a team (45:32) dedicated to doing that. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And just lastly, on risk premia, you acquired a team from AlphaParity earlier this year. Just curious if you could update us on how that's progressing? And how you're thinking about the opportunity set there? And how this could potentially fit into building out an expanded institutional business? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think it's just, it's again, just bringing in talent with outside expertise and views and a different way of thinking about the market and a different way of customizing portfolios. And we didn't talk a lot about the solution side and building that out as a separate team now from the alternative side, as far as having a head and a new dedicated person to do that. So this is just another tool in the box that allows us to do things that we couldn't do before, and it's really about bringing people in that can bring a broader array of customized solutions. And we're already, I think, starting to see some wins in places we haven't had before, and one more recently on the variable annuity side on a new asset class, and a lot of that was just having that solutions build out and depth. And that's really what these people bring. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back from an earlier question here on revenue share. So just to clarify your comments there on being limited by the prospectus, I'm guessing that that's based on like 12b-1 and payments that would be included in the expense ratio, but how about revenue share payments that would be made that are funded by Franklin's P&L and not within the fund? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, you still have to disclose that in the prospectus and we have caps on fixed income and equity by fund in the prospectus. And I think today there's probably only one relationship that would be affected by our caps, where we can't meet the revenue share number. And that means we're not going to be able to wholesale in that one channel, and it's not a significant one for us, not one I'm going to mention, but if you haven't read about it, it means it's probably not that big. And I think all of the rest we've been able to meet, so that's the point. It is out of our P&L, but it's also disclosed and it also has a cap on it for us. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for that. And then I think you mentioned a factor that drove the increase in the comp expectations for this year improved investment performance. So I know the one year performance has improved a lot, but some of the longer-terms, not so much. Which timeframes tend to drive pay for performance by your guys' calculations? And can you help us understand that a little bit better? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I mean, it's a one, three, and five, we feel like that's an important way to kind of look at it in the right perspective. But, again, sometimes the numbers, the five-year number, for example, $90 billion of that is Franklin Income Fund that's in the 52nd percentile, and probably moved into the 48th percentile in the last month, because it's outperformed over the last month. So immediately, that number shifts from a 48 or something to a 70 with one fund in a few weeks. So I think, overall, if you look at the investment teams, the big shifts are Templeton. That's a fairly significant pool for us. The Global Bond group is excellent over mutual series. So a lot \u2013 there's been a pretty strong rebound, and I think the number was if you take our top 10 flagship funds, nine out of 10 in those three periods we're talking about, we're in the top two quartiles. So that shows you a real consistency across the line up, and they are revenue generated pools based on performance, so you will have upward pressure from that. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey. Thanks for the follow up. As a follow-up to Glenn's question, you've added a lot on the distribution side, and high profile, both non-U.S. and U.S. can you give us an idea of a timeline to expect some tangible sales traction with those changes? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I wouldn't have a timeline. I think it wouldn't be appropriate, and I think the driver is still going to be relative performance more than just putting new distribution people in place, and certainly with the U.K. hire, that'll take time in assess that market and how we build out there. It's a market we historically have not put a huge effort in on the distribution side just because for us, historically, they've had a lot of global equity managers and that's been our lead product, so it hasn't been something that we've made a big effort, but that may change with this person. And so, I don't have a timeframe for what that means. I think first, that person gets in, looks at the market, and then comes up with a plan and we maybe will be better suited in three months or six months to talk about that. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. And then just quickly on the $2 billion institutional guide, that run rate historically is very consistently kind of in the 2 to 3 range per quarter. So should we take the fact that you're actually giving a specific number to mean that you feel like this is unusually high for where we are in the quarter? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, I just think it was a certainty that we had, and it's already funding, so I think they felt like they'd mentioned it. And probably the importance of not seeing anything in this quarter to say, hey, there were wins this quarter, they just funded next quarter to get to more of a normalized, so you don't put it in at zero. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Of course. All right. Thanks. Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, thank you, everybody, for attending the quarterly call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Today's conference has concluded. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Brenda, and I will be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Well, good morning, and thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO, and me to discuss the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Importantly, flows continue to trend in the right direction, as we've seen redemptions slow and sales begin to rebound over the course of the year, led by our international retail business. Fiscal year financial results remain strong, as we prudently managed expenses while also investing in what we hope will be new areas of growth. And on the capital management front, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the year. Now we welcome any questions you might have on our results. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : In the prepared remarks, it was mentioned that the insurance redemptions were the lowest in the decade. Just first, is that comment about gross or net redemptions? And the insurance win, can you share with us sort of what product won for you or what asset class? Just a little more color there. And then lastly, do you think this is sort of an indication or other indications that the insurance channel has really turned the corner here? Greg Johnson : Yes. I mean, I think, as we said before, there is a lot of movement within that channel and the lumpiness of those redemptions that you still have some coming. Some have been delayed, in particular, and some have been withdrawn. But it just happened to be, for that quarter, we didn't see any. I think, next quarter, there's still a chance of some lumpiness coming through. But hopefully, our goal is to try to capture some of that by introducing things like low-volatility equity products that are geared towards what they may be looking for. I think that's what we're trying to do in saving that. I think, today, we have approximately $40 billion of assets that you'd put in that category, of that traditional VA business. And I don't know what percent is still at risk, but probably half of that would be still put in that category. Again, that's a... Ken Worthington : And the wind this quarter was, I guess, a little VA product or something like that? Greg Johnson : Right. Yes. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Greg, just on the flow trends, an improvement we're seeing. You mentioned in the commentary, obviously, the international retail has been driving it, and then you've seen some pickup on the institutional, on the non-U. S. institutional side of the market. So both of those are good. In the U.S., when you look at the institutional part of the business, what's the biggest challenge? Is it performance? Is it value versus growth? Just -- what could maybe shift that momentum? And then on the retail side, I guess, you're seeing the same pressures that the whole industry is seeing from active-passive. But you guys have been working on some of the alternative product solutions. So how much traction are you starting to gain on some of the distribution platforms that can maybe partially offset some of the industry headwinds? Greg Johnson : I think the U.S. institutional, if you look at historically for the organization, the majority of the assets and, really, the business was built around Templeton and global equities. You don't have that. I think it's more of an open playing field as we get outside of the U.S. So you just haven't had the base of assets, the consultant relations on the other side of the business. So for us, that -- with value and its longest underperformance stretch probably in history and a lot with that moving to indexing on the -- for that portion within international equities. That area of the business has been under obvious pressure. We've continued to build -- I think the opportunity is still in the fixed income area for us. That's where we're getting significant wins outside of the U.S., and we hope to build that in the U.S. And we've recently made some hires in the U.S. institutional side to build on that opportunity that we see is there. So I think it's really getting the message out, building the right teams in place to support other mandates rather than, I think, we were a very focused organization on the Templeton side and need to broaden that out to other areas in the U.S. And your second part of the question was on just retail. Is that right? Or... Michael Carrier : Yes. It was just -- you've seen the strength on retail outside of the U.S. Same concept, meaning inside the U.S. You guys have been working on some of the newer type of product offerings, whether it's ETFs, alternatives, K2. Just how much traction are you starting to see on the platforms to maybe offset some of the traditional pressure that we're seeing in the industry? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean, they're certainly growing and having a positive effect. And as we said before, it just takes time. And the solutions side is one that we're continuing to build. And obviously, the multi-assets and doing more in that area will be important for us, not only in the U.S., but in Europe. But I think the K2 side is contributing. I mean, it's somewhat tough then a hedge fund to fund in a risk-on environment where the markets are running to get a lot of traction. But we're still seeing a lot of interest and positive flows. And I think if you get a little more volatility in the market, those kind of alternatives are going to look very attractive. And the ETFs, we know, takes time, and we're building that, putting the resources behind it, and we're pleased with the progress as far as getting on as many platforms as possible. And then it's really how its performance doing. If you're -- especially, if they're in a smart beta fund, you've got to validate that factor-based performance, and then we think we're on our way there as well. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Last quarter, you mentioned an ongoing fee rationalization process at the fund board level getting started. Could you update us on any conclusions from that and, to the extent any changes were made, what they were? Greg Johnson : It's still really I mean, I think, ongoing. It wasn't really at a fund board level. It was really just management looking and positioning. And I think we made some adjustments to some funds. As I said, I think, in the prior call, we didn't identify anything that we'd call out as far as significant assets to reduce fees. But there was some areas and things like limited duration and shorter-term funds that we thought were not as competitively priced, not big assets, so not -- wouldn't affect our revenue number much. But it's just really -- we're continuing to do that. It's looking at every class. We don't want to be in the fourth quartile. We think we're fairly well positioned. There's a couple of areas we're still looking at, but really nothing to call out at this stage as to say that we recognize the importance of being competitive. And fee rankings can be as important as total return in this kind of environment. So we need to be realistic about that. KenLewis: I think the comments in the past on the border initiative was more related to products and just looking at our product offerings versus fees. Patrick Davitt : Okay. That's helpful. And could you size the fixed index annuity win? Greg Johnson : Size the fixed index annuity? Patrick Davitt : The win that you called out in the... Greg Johnson : Yes, we'll get back to you on that one because I don't have that in front of me. Operator : The next questions come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : I assume there'll probably be some additional detail in the K, but I wanted to get an update for your current estimate of excess capital outside of the U.S., really that you'd repatriate back in the U.S. if we get a tax holiday here. Ken Lewis : Sure, Craig. So outside the U.S., I think we're looking at around $6 billion or so of cash, maybe a little bit higher. And what we've identified is kind of -- and this will be refined in the K, you're correct. But what we identified -- my current estimate is around $2 billion of that is set aside for regulatory, perhaps, [seed]capital needs are just other business needs. Craig Siegenthaler : So Ken, just to be clear, you said $6 billion is excess, but you need $2 billion for regulatory. So is it $4 billion net? Ken Lewis : Correct. Outside the U.S. Craig Siegenthaler : Outside the U.S. So $4 billion net outside the U.S. And let's just say tax reform is unsuccessful, I know you see you have some cash and some higher tax domicile regions like Luxembourg and Singapore, but then you also have some lower tax domicile regions like the Bahamas. Would you ever explore trying to repatriate some of that higher tax domicile cash back to the U.S. if the outlook for tax reform is pretty bad at some point? Ken Lewis : Craig, could you just repeat the question? There was some noise in here. Craig Siegenthaler : Sure. If there is no tax reform, and if you guys reach the conclusion that there will be no tax reform in the future, would you target some of your excess cash in the higher tax domicile regions like Luxembourg or Singapore in the event that you think there's going to be no tax reform? And [indiscernible] out in the future? Ken Lewis : Right. I would say the answer to that is yes, and it's something that we are constantly evaluating. And so to the extent where -- those economics make sense, we've done it in the past, where we've repatriated earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, and we would do that in the future. Greg Johnson : I'll just follow up on the other question, just to clarify, on the cash. I think, if you were to say what's liquid today that you could bring, probably $4 billion is the right answer. If you could say, how much will we probably bring back, it would be -- or free up would be about over $6 billion because a lot of that is in investments and things that we can liquidate and things like in our short-term income funds. So the number would be more like $6 billion of what we... Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Just curious for a quick update on both Franklin income and Global Bond. In general, performance has been a lot better. A subtopic on that is if you could give a little color of the $850 million in expected redemption for Global Bond from some key distributor, is that a consolidation thing? Just curious for any color you can help us with there. Greg Johnson : Yes, I think that's just within a large kind of solutions provider where they're going a little more low risk-off as far as looking at the portfolio. I think the flows and trends continue to look very strong. And I would still argue, as I've said in the past, if you have any meaningful rise in rates, this fund will do very well with its flat to no duration risk. So I think it's one of the few out there that -- in the fixed income category that will do very well in a rising rate environment. The income fund, on the other hand, obviously, has duration risk. But really, if you look at the quarter or the outflows and some of the pressure in the last quarter despite some of the better short-term performance, it really relates to the 3-year number, which is still, as of end of the year, was under or just in the third quartile. As of the first few weeks of the year, it was back in the second quartile. And that's a very important number on the Morningstar metrics. So we think the next look, we hope that gets upgraded back to its 4-star level, getting rid of that one bad quarter when we had energy crisis really move the relative number up on the 3 years. So we're still -- that's a very important, obviously, metric for sales for that fund, and hopefully getting it back to 4 stars with the improved 3-year number should bode well moving forward. Glenn Schorr : Any sort of -- how real-time is that? Let's say the tough quarter rolls off, the upgrade happens, how quickly does the system take hold of things like that? Greg Johnson : It just depends. I mean, but it -- I think the other pressure you still have is just around the move from brokerage to fee-based and how that has, as I said in past calls, an effect on heightened redemptions that wouldn't be there normally, and it's hard to separate out. But I think, from a sales side, we are now -- we've just gotten approved on 2 major new platforms with the income fund, and I think that's going to help a lot as we move towards fee-based and these are in the fee-based platforms on 2 big distributors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : Just Ken, you mentioned -- you gave some expense guidance to just look out to the new fiscal year. So a [pre-board] range of 3% to 5%. Just sort of wondering if you could frame that out a little bit around a couple of different aspects. First, what kind of revenue backdrop are you assuming? And then secondly, what kind of flexibility do you have on that expense growth if markets were to not meet whatever expectations built into your revenue picture? Ken Lewis : Sure. Some but not all of that has some revenue estimates. And the way we look at it, we say increased flows, but it's such a guessing game, if you will, to project what flows are going to be in the future, as you know. But certainly, it's aspirational in the sense that the business units have said, \"Okay, if we invest XYZ, we think there's a reasonable chance that we can improve incremental revenue in the short term.\" And then some of the other expenses are more longer-term aspirations. And then regarding your question on flexibility, I think, it's not like we have agreed to do these things and implemented them on day 1. They're going to take time to phase in. We're going to evaluate the situation as we go forward. We cannot spend the additional money. We can pull back the additional money. But as it is today, this is our best guess. That range that I gave you is our best guess of where expenses might be year-over-year next year. But certainly, there's a lot of flexibility if markets take a downturn, and we want to go in a different direction. Bill Katz : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Greg, just want to come back to the discussion of maybe Franklin's position in sort of U.S. When I look at your gross sales dynamics, those seem to be relatively soft. I think you explained some of that away with potentially some of the weather issues in the U.S. in the quarter, which was very helpful. But is there a more profound issue here for Franklin, just having been a strong beneficiary of the growth in mutual funds and brokerage assets, and that sort of migrates to more customized advisory fee-based type of outcomes? Do you need to do something more structural? Or you're simply just waiting for the performance to turn and then gearing that through the distribution channel? Greg Johnson : I mean, I think we have been doing something structural, are in the middle of doing things that, I think, we all recognize sitting and waiting for the old brokerage model as going to be failed effort. So we are very much in part of what -- a big part of what Ken was talking about on the contingency and some of the spending is really geared towards, continuing to upgrade the distribution model to meet the gatekeeper and institutional quality and institutional quality across all of our groups. But really, the pressure in the U.S. are core strengths. And at the end of the day, most of our assets are value. And if you look at the Mutual Series, Templeton, you had a good start to the year, but a very tough finish to the year. The things have led the market 1/3 of the S&P's returns. That just makes it very difficult for you real core value person to get any kind of play in this market. So I think that's a big effect. But it's also, I think, part of it is you have to adjust the product line and make sure that you have mandates and styles and sleeves that are cost-competitive that can fit into solutions. You have solutions that differentiate, whether it's target date funds or multi-asset funds, that we can build. And part of that is having now ETFs that we can use in the lower cost way as part of that solution and have open architecture solutions that we've done around the globe with other partners. Those are the, I think, things that we're continuing to try to adapt to, but we're certainly not sitting around waiting to get back to the old brokerage model because, I think, at the end of the day, we recognize that the fee-based side is going to continue to be the driver going forward. Bill Katz : Okay. Just trying to tie into that, just how do you think about maybe turbocharging that shift? Many of your peers talk about the importance of scale diversification, customization, active-passive, et cetera. And you have some, but not all of those attributes. How do you think about repatriation opportunity? You mentioned $6 billion, which is certainly, I imagine, many of your peers potentially using that for maybe acquisitions or other type of growth versus capital return to investors? Greg Johnson : Well, I think, as we've said before, I don't think the repatriation has impacted that part of our -- we've added a lot of small type funds that improve our -- or management companies that give us more flexibility around solutions like the risk premium 1, commodities firm, all kinds of different styles looking at ESG like many today, whether you buy or continue to build that. So that's very much part of what we have done and will continue to do and differentiating the solutions side by having. I think that's the real advantage of a large global scale player, that you can have a lot of those pieces together, to really build the solutions capability, including the risk side that we have a very robust risk group as well. That's where -- if you looked at our plan and priorities, that's really what it's all built around. It's pulling all of that together and having a world-class solutions group. That really would be the top goal. And if we see any weaknesses in that, that's certainly something we'll continue to go out and look at and purchase in the market. But we have always -- whether it's offshore, onshore, the balance sheet keeps us -- I think, has allowed us that option, and we'll continue to do that. Ken Lewis : I think the tax reform or the tax changes that are being proposed a little different than it was last time during the repatriation where it's kind of a one and done deal. From what I understand of where the tax direction is going, it kind of levels the playing field, from our perspective, in terms of where the cash is. So in the future, it wouldn't matter and it shouldn't really impact our M&A decisions. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bren Mc Hawken with UBS. Bren Mc Hawken : I got a follow-up, slightly different direction from Craig's question earlier. We just had the House, I think, pass the budget. So move to step closer here to tax reform. If we get repatriation, and you're allowed to repatriate, can you update us on how you would weigh buybacks versus special dividends versus M&A? Ken Lewis : Yes, I think we weigh that question all the time. I guess, and I've been asked this question before, and I can point to, I guess, more than 10 years ago when we did this in the past. And that's kind of the only guide that we have because it's going to be a separate discussion at the board level. And we would have to weigh what the M&A landscape is at that time. Is there something really interesting that is going on at that time? Share buybacks are always interesting to us. So I don't know that it actually changes our direction from what we've done in the past. Greg Johnson : And I would say, obviously, we just had a board meeting this week, and that was a topic of discussion with the board. And we recognized that once -- if repatriation does go through, that the investors are going expect that answer help how much do you really need of free cash on the balance sheet. And that's really what we're looking at today. It's coming up with a plan to go back to the board and say, \"All right, if we bring free up $6 billion more, how much do we need on the balance sheet? How much do we need for buybacks? How much do we need for M&A? And whether or not that means a special dividend?\" All of that would be certainly on the table for discussion. So I'd say we're putting that together right now, and too early to indicate before the board ultimately is going to make that call. Bren Mc Hawken : Sure, sure. And then one follow-up on the institutional, U.S. institutional business. It seemed from your commentary that, that business remains difficult, yet I think you also said that insurance are the lowest redemptions in a decade. So does that mean that there were certain other parts of the domestic institutional business that deteriorated? And if so, what were those parts? Greg Johnson : Yes. I mean, I said before, the continued pressure has been international value as a dominant part of our institutional business in the U.S. And that's been under pressure. Value has lagged to growth. And if you don't have technology exposure in the portfolio, it's been pretty tough to retain assets in that deep value approach. We have seen redemptions. You've also seen pressure, as we all know, for anybody that looks at the foundation endowment or any institutional plan that you see more and more go towards indexing and passive. And that's been ongoing pressure as well. You just haven't seen the new kind of opportunities in the U.S. of monies moving into active international in the value space. And that's our dominant portion of assets. So that's really why that segment has been under the most pressure in the U.S. Operator : And our next questions coming from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Greg, if you can comment a little bit, and I appreciate the color on the distribution in the U.S. But a little bit on the tempo of what your sales force is saying about what advisors are thinking on DOL. Looks like things got a little bit better after the, certainty, late last year and earlier this year. But we did see active flows for industry starting to -- active outflows from the industry starting to pick up again. Do you anticipate that will be a little bit bigger of a headwind in the coming 1 or 2 quarters than it has been? And also, if you can size what you think the impact from the hurricanes were on your sales in the third quarter. Greg Johnson : First of all, I mean, the hurricane impact, I think it had an impact because we saw a, clearly, in Florida and Texas, that they were off like over 30% in that month, in September. So it did have an impact. I think the -- our view on DOL is that -- or our hope is that the SEC comes out with a standard that addresses this without destroying the brokerage business. I think that's where it's going today, is that you'll have a way that without a best interest contract without a process other than going to court to settle disputes. I think those are private right of action, get rid of that. And you have something that, I think, will serve the industry well. I think there's just -- there's no reason why brokerage shouldn't continue to exist. It's appropriate for certain people, and I think it's inappropriate to move certain people. So I think the regulator understands that. So will that slow down the move towards fee-based? Maybe, a little bit. But at the end of the day, I still think that, that's where you need to think about -- you got a make sure your firm's properly positioned in that space. And as far as active and redemptions and how much of it relates, it's just very hard. I think what we do know is that as you transition from a brokerage to a fee-based account, it's -- you may have 1 out of 3 of your products on that lineup instead of all of them, and that's a general statement. But one that it makes it difficult to capture the assets that you had. So anybody with multiple products, with one relationship, is going to be under pressure as those assets transition. But I do think the pressure of the transition could be alleviated somewhat if we have a standard that allows those 2 to coexist. Brian Bedell : And do you think the advisers are kind of waiting for that to happen? In other words, are they really kind of not doing much until they get more clarity on that? Or do you think they are heading one way or the other? Greg Johnson : Well, I think some are, and some aren't. There's pressure to move. I think the management, many have embraced the rule and fiduciary standard and are putting pressure to do that. But clearly, some are not comfortable moving to that, and we'll wait. But it's hard for me to answer that exactly in any way, it's definitive. Brian Bedell : Yes, understood. And then, Ken, just on the spending for next year. I appreciate the color on that. You mentioned a bunch of initiatives. One of them in the prepared remarks were initiatives to enhance investment performance. Maybe if you could just elaborate on that a little bit. And then is -- are you still potentially -- or would you potentially look at outsourcing the back-office custody and funds accounting? I know you guys always review that. This would be typically the time when you would do that. Is that something that's on the table for this coming fiscal year? Ken Lewis : Sure. I'll answer those questions. On the investment performance, it's really where can we distinguish our investment performance, find new ideas. So it's really investing, I guess, one category would be investing in fintech, but also just investing in systems that give our portfolio managers the edge and get -- finding unique information to distinguish their investment performance. So it's kind of the broad category there. Nothing more specific than that. And in terms of the fund accounting, I would say that we have looked at that. And in the current frame of mind, it's not to do that outsourcing anytime in the near future. And in fact, invest in systems there as well to take advantage -- to be more scalable and be able to be more flexible and customize some of the unique product demands that are coming down the pipe. Greg Johnson : And I would just add things like, I mean, we are investing in data. We've been doing that. We think that, again, for a global-scale player, is going to be important part of active management going forward for building better factory-based ETFs. And that's an important initiative that does require additional resources as we continue to build that out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I guess, could you talk a bit about the fee rates and kind of based on the mix of business, that you're seeing today, and kind of trajectory we can think about that going into next year on that kind of ins and outs of non-U. S. versus U.S? Ken Lewis : Well, I mean, that does play into a factor, the fee rate itself not, necessarily operating income, but the mix between international and U.S. I mean, from where we stand today, we don't really see a significant change in the fee rate. It's hard to predict mix 12 years out. But from where we stand today, we're not seeing any significant change in the effective fee rate for next year. It's like downtick. Greg Johnson : And I think, as I've said before, I mean, one, it's hard for everybody to be the in bottom 2 quartile. That's challenging. And if somebody believes passive outperforms active, you can cut your fees in half and only lose your margin. You're not going to get any incremental. So I think that's the key is we have to switch that around, rising rate environment and volatility tends to mean that the active will do better. And I think that's probably where I would argue where we're heading. Dan Fannon : Got it. And Greg, you mentioned in the comments earlier that about some of the placements of some of the funds on key distribution list and platforms. Can you talk a bit about that? Was there more this quarter? I think the reference in the previous quarter or the earlier was for the year. So just curious as to where the momentum might be if we're already seeing that potentially in the fourth quarter numbers or is that more for next year? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think it's more for next year. I think the crazy thing about how this transition works with brokerage and fee-based and sometimes, you have to almost get funds reapproved on the platform, funds that have significant assets already in the system and have to go through all the validation of why that's beyond the new platform. And we've been able to do that with 2 of our largest distributors where they haven't been on that in the past. So I hope that means improved flows but it would be in the coming year, not -- and probably not right away. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : A couple of topics I was hoping to delve into. I guess, first on the global international equity part of the business. Obviously, flows there remain kind of challenge for you guys. This has been an area of strength for the industry broadly in many of your peers the reported so far. Is it just the performance issue? Or is there something in the distribution landscape broadly that you need to address, I guess, more aggressively to start winning more of a fair share of flows on the global international equity side? Greg Johnson : No, I think it's just the style with the deep value style of Templeton and not having really -- any real technology exposure in this kind of market. You're going to be challenged to match up against anybody who does. And I think that's been the bigger issue for our traditional global equity group. Alex Blostein : Got you. And then the second question, just around your ETF efforts. Obviously, the competition in the smart beta space is heating up, scale becoming more critical. We've obviously seen Invesco make a couple of acquisitions recently. And pricing becomes more and more a factor. So just taking all of that together, can you just spend a minute on LibertyQ strategy? And does it make sense to add to it inorganically just to kind of create more scale and critical mass in that business? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think it does. I think it's just -- you have to -- if the -- and we continue to look at every opportunity that's out there. But that would certainly jump-start the effort. And we have filed for passive ETFs, which we believe will give us quick scale in that marketplace and improve all visibility for the rest of Liberty. And that's very much part of our strategy is to be cost-competitive within the passive sector where existing assets are there. So I think that's as important to become one of the top players in terms of size. That's certainly a goal. And one that, back to Ken's point on resources and incremental cost in specialists around the globe supporting that effort. But it -- we still are firm believers on the smart beta concept, and we just rolled out the first multifactor-based emerging markets fund in Europe. And it's been a very aggressive schedule for us between Canada, Europe and the U.S. in getting these funds out and we'll continue to be so as we get ready to roll out the 20 passive ones. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : You mentioned some onetimers in the expense line. I imagine this is in the 10-Q, but I haven't had a chance to look. Could you be more specific on how big those were and what they were? Ken Lewis : I think, there's quite a number of them. So I think maybe the best thing to point out is when we look ahead, like, to next quarter, I mean, I think we mentioned this in the notes that normally, there is seasonality where some of the lines like the tech line and the G&A line are a little bit higher in the fourth quarter and then a little bit lower in the first quarter of the following year. In G&A, we have advertising that's typically a seasonal spend that goes down. So if I look at G&A, what's a reasonable run rate, given market levels because some of the expense line and [indiscernible] in there are driven by market values. But given the current market levels, I would say that the run rate's more towards where it was in the last 2 quarters prior to the -- I'm sorry, in the June quarter and the March quarter versus the September quarter. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. ChrisHarris: Can you guys give us an update on K2? What are the trends you're seeing there? And how much AUM is that part of your business? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think I mentioned earlier on the call that it continues to be positive flows and interest. I think it -- hedge strategy in a risk-on environment, it's hard to keep up with what everything else is doing. And we feel like it's an important part to balance the portfolio, and many people are using it for that. And today, probably, over -- I think, in the retail funds, over $2 billion, $2.2 billion and in total assets, $15 billion or $10 billion. Is it $10 billion? Yes, that's right. Right around $10 billion for total assets there. Operator : Okay. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. Are there any closing comments you'd like to make? Greg Johnson : Well, I'll make one, just I think I'm looking at my notes and just want to make sure that I mentioned. We talked -- there was a lot of questions around global equity and value and not having the growth side, and I'd be remiss not to mention that we do have actually a very strong global growth group. And when somebody is talking about distribution opportunities in the institutional side of the U.S., I'd certainly put that one there because this team's done an excellent job, a New York-based global growth group, in building very strong long-term records. And it's a matter for us to get that awareness out there. And also, even within Templeton, the emerging markets, which does have some technology exposure, has done very well over the last 1- and 3-year period. So I think that's another very positive story, along with our Asian Growth fund that under the Templeton even in this market, has had excellent performance in the short run. So with that advertisement, I will close off and say thank you, everybody, for participating and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Kevin, and I will be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Johnson : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me as usual is Ken Lewis, our CFO. And you may be able to tell by my voice that I\u2019m recovering from that flu, so I have asked Jed Plafker, who heads up our distribution, if there\u2019s any questions around flows. And we also have Gwen Shaneyfelt, who is our Senior Vice President of Global Accounting and Tax to get into any specific questions around the tax reform. Today, we reported first quarter results that included a $1.1 billion charge related to the recently passed tax reform. Hopefully, you had a chance to review the commentary we provided earlier today, which outlines the details of the charge and our expectation for taxes going forward. We\u2019re excited by the options created by corporate tax reform and are currently discussing how we can best serve all stakeholders. These options include committing resources to further develop our financial technologies and investment data science expertise; obviously M&A activity; investing to optimize our global distribution efforts; and introducing and seeding new products and services. We also plan to make investments that directly benefit employees and the communities where they do business. Another exciting recent announcement is, we reached an agreement to acquire Edinburgh Partners Limited, an established global value manager. Now, I would like to open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Now we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carrier : All right. Thanks, guys. Greg, you mentioned some of the priorities from the tax benefits and what you\u2019re thinking about? Just wanted to maybe shed a little bit more color on that, when we think about the $9 billion-plus cash and investments, how are you guys thinking going forward on what you need to retain on the balance sheet, whether it\u2019s for operational purposes, regulatory purposes? And then how much is excess? And then of that excess, some of the things that you mentioned whether it\u2019s investments, capital return, what\u2019s the timing on that in terms of making some of those decisions of what to do with the excess? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think, the timing is really a function of what the Board decides to do. I mean, I think, ultimately, we are putting together various options. And I think, at the end of the day, we will always err on the conservative side of capital management, because we feel it can be very strategic in the long-term to have that flexibility on whatever comes up in any kind of market condition. And we also find that, there\u2019s a value from our \u2013 from investors that are in our funds and separate accounts that the rating on the company. It\u2019s important to have that strength of the balance sheet. So, that will be built into whatever cushion that we look at. And we\u2019re really in the process of doing that today to kind of figure out looking at all the levers what makes the most sense. We\u2019ve gone out to institutional holders and try to get as much feedback as possible in this process and we encourage any feedback directly to our team as well. But it\u2019s really too early and we\u2019re careful about setting any expectation around that. But I think, there will be some, obviously, more information forthcoming certainly after our next Board meeting. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. And then sort of a follow-up on maybe organic growth side. You mentioned in the commentary some adds to platforms during the quarter. Just wanted to maybe get a little bit more color on that. And then on the flip side, just given the short-term performance that\u2019s under some pressure, how are clients reacting to that? And I know some of the products relative to some of the benchmarks or the categories that you\u2019re in, there are some nuances there. But just a little color in terms of the platform adds, how that might be a benefit versus the performance being a headwind? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I mean, I think the point was that, one of the things that we\u2019ve done is continue to build out the consultant part of the distribution effort on the retail side. And that\u2019s so important in communicating what our fund is doing and its risk attribution performance, all those things. And you really \u2013 as we\u2019ve said before, I mean, it\u2019s like a funnel with fee-based. You\u2019ll have \u2013 you had a world, where everything was on the brokerage platform to take. Today, where there maybe 30% of those funds on a given platform. So every \u2013 anytime you have funds that get added specifically to platforms now that that could be a style, it\u2019s out of favor. It doesn\u2019t mean, you\u2019re going to get an immediate flow into a value-based global fund. But it means, one, you\u2019ll do a better job of retaining assets; and two, when the market turns, you have an ability to capture new organic growth where you wouldn\u2019t in the past. I\u2019ll ask Jed, if he has anything specific he wants to add. Jed Plafker : Yes, I think, that\u2019s right. I mean, on the fee-based side, we\u2019re seeing now about 75% of the sales go to fee-based, which is almost double what it was seven or eight years ago. And so whereas we\u2019ve been on platforms in the cushion base, we\u2019re adding our funds and strategies to the fee-based side. We build up the team to meet with those research and gatekeepers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, one of the \u2013 I want to talk about M&A, because one of the options for the corporate tax reform was not M&A. And so just thinking about the \u2013 I know, you\u2019ve announced the transaction here recently. But now with more proceeds and more cash available like, how you\u2019re thinking about it on a longer-term basis? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think, we\u2019ve always been \u2013 we always think about it. I think, the difference probably today is that that everything is fairly equal as we look at the world. You \u2013 in the past, if it was captive offshore cash and before any tax reform, you may have had a bias to try to do something outside the U.S. I think, today, the U.S., it\u2019s all fungible cash around the world. So we would look openly to opportunities as much here in the U.S. as abroad. I think that that whether \u2013 so as I guess, the net-net would be, you have a opportunity to do a larger acquisition in the U.S. than you did in the past, that would be the only real change, I think, as far as how we look at the M&A landscape. Daniel Fannon : But it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s not one of your priorities as you think about the next 12 months or kind of on a more near-term basis? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I think, it\u2019s a priority as far as having the financial wherewithal and balance strength to do that at any given time. So that\u2019s part of how we\u2019re going to look at capital going forward. But it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t feel any urgency to do a deal, because of tax reform. Daniel Fannon : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Worthington : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I apologize if I missed the obvious question here or the obvious answer. How much do you anticipate repatriating at this point, given where your cash balances are and the nuances of the law? And then is it possible given that you\u2019ve been waiting for repatriation for probably, at least, a decade and have been thinking a lot about it. And even with Trump being elected, I think, you guys were anticipating repatriation being one of its changes. So can you give us maybe an estimate or at least a direction in terms of what you think will make it into a dividend versus what makes it back into a buyback versus what makes it into just investments in the business. How are you \u2013 how do you gauge the level of each of those with the money that you bring back? Thanks. Kenneth Lewis : That is \u2013 those are exactly the questions that Greg was referring to earlier that we\u2019re discussing with the Board. I think to the first question, we talked about what we viewed is excess cash before in the neighborhood of $5 billion to $6 billion. What we do about is, the first priority is to invest in the long-term success of the company. What that means, it could mean a M&A, but also we\u2019re always \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue our history of being shareholder friendly. So the tax law is the month old, discussions are ongoing. We\u2019re going to be as transparent with the investors as possible. But it\u2019s probably going to take us a couple of months to work through all those questions. Kenneth Worthington : Okay. So no even feel for what might make it into dividend versus buyback? Is one a more obvious answer than the other would it be equal? Does one come more quickly? Gregory Johnson : No, I think, that that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s a decision first of all that the Board makes and so which haven\u2019t had the opportunity to have those conversations with the Board. Kenneth Lewis : And I just think it\u2019s \u2013 to speculate on what that \u2013 or what that would look like at this stage, I think, we don\u2019t want to create any expectation out there before we really vetted it and had Board approval. So, I think, you\u2019re right. All of those are the obvious levers and we will come back, but we certainly don\u2019t want anything out there right now that states the plan as to do X one. We have to get that plan approved by our Board. Kenneth Worthington : Okay. And I guess, just you had discussed investing back into the business and you gave some, I think, some higher-level themes that you were considering with some of the repatriation windfall. Any chance you could flush those out a little bit more here? Gregory Johnson : I think, the first priority as always is to improve and deliver good performance of the fund. So we have made some investments in improving our capabilities in the investing area in solutions. We invested \u2013 we\u2019ve been investing in technology. We\u2019re investing in also distribution, the changing distribution landscape and getting smart investing in technology in that and new products. So it\u2019s \u2013 and marketing, so it\u2019s kind of \u2013 the list we\u2019ve gone through in the past all the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve gone through, there\u2019s no change to that. But I mean, you want to add anything on the distribution side that we\u2019re investing in\u2026 Jed Plafker : Yes. Sure, sure. We\u2019re adding a fair amount of resources in a few different areas, one, on the institutional side in the U.S. Greg mentioned, consultant relations on the client service team, as well as sales. We\u2019re building out the strategic relationship team, which is on the group responsible for getting funds on platforms. We\u2019re adding people to our sales team. We\u2019re rolling out more of a channel-centric model for some of the broker-dealers, and so we\u2019re adding people in that area. So I think that there\u2019s a fair number of resources on the distribution side. Kenneth Lewis : And also in alternatives and solutions. Gregory Johnson : And I would say, just on the capital side one thing that we\u2019ve been expanding on too is just using our balance sheet to invest directly in companies and forming funds in areas like industrial tech and we have another one that\u2019s an AI and FinTech specialized area, too. And part of this is just strategic for us to stand in the forefront of those developments and part of it is to also build out within alternatives a capability within private equity and venture in that area. So that would be the use of capital. Kenneth Worthington : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brennan Hawken : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one following up on Ken\u2019s question, is debt pay down one potential use of the funds that you guys are considering as well beyond the previous priorities that you mentioned? Kenneth Lewis : Yes, absolutely, as of the tax charges payable over the next two years, so those definitely come into the equation. Brennan Hawken : Okay, terrific. And then is there \u2013 just thinking about maybe potentially framing possible investments, could you give us an idea about how much expense uplift was driven by those types of investments that you guys have made recently just so we can maybe keep that into context and consider possible alternatives? Gregory Johnson : Sure. I think, when we talk \u2013 when we spoke last, we had just finished our budget. And our estimate at that time was that, those kind of \u2013 the laundry list that I gave you was going to probably increase expenses year-over-year by about 5% to 6%, and I think we\u2019re still on track with that guidance. Brennan Hawken : Okay, perfect. And then just making one more here, you had mentioned tied to your expense outlook for the year that Edin \u2013 that would be beyond Edinburgh. How should we think about what Edinburgh will add from revenue and expense perspectives? Gregory Johnson : I think, we\u2019ll be in a better position to give you kind of specific line items maybe the next time that we get together. But generally, it\u2019s \u2013 from a cash flow perspective, it\u2019s accretive, from a GAAP perspective, it might be slightly dilutive, but not materially so\u2026 Brennan Hawken : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is now live. William Katz : Okay. Thank you. Greg, I feel you\u2019re flu pain, may be that will be the reason for my question here. But I\u2019m still a little foggy on your priorities for this capital management. I\u2019ve heard you wrote certain things in your prerecorded commentary with a supplement and both you and Ken sort of ticked off a couple different things. Could you just, again, prioritize where you sort of think the waterfall for these priorities are? And I guess, within that, when is the Board meeting? Because I think the market is a little surprised that we don\u2019t have news today. And so I\u2019m just trying to understand like, what is going to change in the next x days as we think about that priority list? Gregory Johnson : Bill, well, if you\u2019re foggy, we\u2019ve done a good job in communicating the plan at this stage because, again, I just think you don\u2019t really want to get in front of something that\u2019s important like this. And you have \u2013 as you know, you have all the levers in place. You\u2019ve got your buyback policy. You\u2019ve got your dividend policy. You\u2019ve got special dividend policies. You\u2019ve got \u2013 determined what is the appropriate level, and that\u2019s a big discussion that has to take place that we\u2019re all comfortable with. And we continue to seek input from as many stakeholders as possible. There\u2019s a lot of different views on what we should do. So I think, rather, there\u2019s no rush here to say to the market that we\u2019re going to do x tomorrow. I think you do want to be thoughtful and come back with something that we think makes sense and represents the best interest of all stakeholders. So I think, unfortunately, we don\u2019t really want to communicate any priority of all of those things until we\u2019ve had a real chance to vet that appropriately. William Katz : And then just a clarification. Of the cap \u2013 of the cash that sits on the balance sheet now, the $9 billion, in your recent K, I think, about $3 billion of that is sort of earmarked for operational purposes, et cetera. Is that still the right number? Ken may have said it, I apologize if I missed that number. I\u2019m just trying to think about that incremental number relative to maybe the $6.5 billion that you had mentioned last quarter as sort of net available with this tax reform? Kenneth Lewis : Yes. But \u2013 that could be a little bit on the high side, but that is in the ballpark. If you factor in also longer-term debt repayments and the tax charge that I mentioned, it\u2019s probably a little lower than that. William Katz : Okay, all right. And then just a follow-up question, a little more tactical, maybe to get off the capital management discussion, you recently launched the ETF business a bit of a passive approach to it. Can you give us a sense of where the AUM stand and what some of the net sales have been so far and how you sort of think about where the incremental levers are to grow that part of the business? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think the overall assets are around $1.2 billion. I mean, we just introduced them. I think our feeling is that if you\u2019re going to be a significant player in the ETF business, passive is obviously going to be very important, and we view this as kind of the last available space to do that by having lower costs, country-specific and regional global funds available. So it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s only been out really a very short period. You didn\u2019t see a lot of movement at year-end because of the tax consequences of doing that. And so to date, very \u2013 as expected, some flows, but nothing significant, and we\u2019re just really in the process of going out and getting that message out there that\u2019s available. And I think the point in those categories is that, there\u2019s already significant funds with much higher expense ratios. So we think that part of that should take care of itself. And while it\u2019s not going to have a large impact on the revenue side of it, I think, it\u2019s important on just the flow and building the brand within the ETF space. William Katz : Okay. Thanks, guys. Gregory Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Blostein : Hey, guys, good morning. Gregory Johnson : Good morning, Alex. Alexander Blostein : A couple of quick clarifications, I guess. So Ken, back to the expense discussion, when you talk about the previous guidance, I think, it was 3% to 5% growth, sounds like you guys will be 5% to 6% growth in expenses ex-distribution. But when you think about some of the incremental initiatives for growth that you\u2019ve highlighted, whether it\u2019s tech or investment in data, et cetera, is that inclusive in this, call it, 5% to 6% growth or that could be on top of that once you guys make all the decisions about capital and what \u2013 how you\u2019re going to spend the money? Gregory Johnson : That is inclusive of all of the items that we talked about that are known and we decided to do. So I think, we\u2019re still pretty comfortable of that 5% to 6% expense growth, excluding underwriting distribution is inclusive of all the initiatives that we mentioned. And if we come up with future initiatives with costs, we\u2019ll be transparent with that as well. Alexander Blostein : Got it. And that could be on the back of the discussions with use of capital from the tax reform? Gregory Johnson : Correct. Alexander Blostein : Yep, okay. And then in the press release you guys \u2013 when you went through the number of different things that you could use the excess cash for, you highlighted optimizing global distribution efforts, and I wasn\u2019t 100% clear what you guys meant by that. So maybe flesh that out a little bit. And just any sort of implications when \u2013 if you think about that on how you are selling the product, any incremental focus on one region versus the other, that will be helpful? Jed Plafker : Sure. In addition to the resources we\u2019d talked about on the U.S. side, we\u2019re also increasing our spend on advertising, both on the traditional side as well as on the ETFs, as Greg mentioned. So that that\u2019s certainly an increase. Alexander Blostein : So it\u2019s not really like moving people around geographically, this is literally just investing into distribution? Jed Plafker : Right. I think, there\u2019s some additional resources included in our kind of expanding the international distribution function as well, just the increased headcount. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Great. All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Gregory Johnson : Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : The $1.1 billion tax charge, when you changed the territorial system, just want to \u2013 how was it calculated, because it\u2019s a huge number? Kenneth Lewis : Okay. This might take up the rest of the call. It is calculated based on our accumulated earnings that haven\u2019t been repatriated that we disclosed in the K. But this is going to be a good opportunity for us to let Gwen have a chance at the mike. Gwen Shaneyfelt : Right. So, Ken, you\u2019re exactly right. So basically, we look at what earnings we have yet to repatriate and we do the calculation. Really, you have to add back kind of the deemed \u2013 the taxes that you\u2019ve deemed paid in the foreign jurisdiction to come up with a number and multiply it times the rate. Take credit for those taxes and that\u2019s what comes out to that $1.1 billion number. Also, obviously included in there is some \u2013 there\u2019s a 1.12, which talks about the potential for state taxes on those. So we have included certain states that don\u2019t follow federal automatically. We may have to pay some state tax on those dollars, we bring back as well. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. Okay. And then just on a second subject. I saw that China and also India had good sales momentum in the quarter. What\u2019s driving that? And maybe also, what products are seeing better demand there, too? Jed Plafker : Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 so that\u2019s accurate. So in India, it\u2019s \u2013 all of our local \u2013 locally managed funds, both equity and fixed. We\u2019ve had strong performance on both sides and we\u2019ve had good sales there. In China, it\u2019s really Greater China. So for us, that includes Taiwan and we\u2019ve seen a huge surge in some of the global macro funds. In particular, emerging market bond has been a big fund of interest in Taiwan. And maybe just to mention in China, we recently upgraded our license in Shanghai. And the rules are changing in China on the ownership that you can have as a joint venture partner, which hasn\u2019t been released yet just the actual rules. But we expect that that\u2019s going to be a big market for us going forward. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. Thanks. Just a quick question on the retail fixed income side. In periods of rising rates in the past, I think, the retail investment had been a little bit more emotional. We just had a 19% lift in the equity market in the U.S. and not much at all, if not a little negative in fixed income. Just curious if you\u2019ve seen any reaction yet through January and as people get statements and what you\u2019re thinking on that front going forward? Gregory Johnson : Well, I don\u2019t think the uptick at this stage has been dramatic enough to change. I think, you are certainly getting more headlines on the risk. I think, the \u2013 probably the drop in the munis could be for other reasons. High yield doesn\u2019t appear to be as long as the economy is strong there, they\u2019re less sensitive to duration. So we don\u2019t really have huge exposure to duration risk. If you look at even the global bond fund, which is \u2013 or the global macro, the largest category, that has a flat to negative duration in that fund. So, we hope in a rising rate environment, that could be a very strong story within fixed income. The other \u2013 I think, just from a behavioral standpoint, the difference of fixed income and equity markets is when the equity markets drop and fear comes in, it\u2019s hard to get people back in. Fixed income, remember, somebody was on the sidelines because of where rates are and they back up suddenly look at the equity market and say, gee, now it\u2019s a good time. They backed up 100 basis points, 200 basis points. So you attract new buyers. You attract certainly people locking in liabilities as rates go up as well. So there\u2019s always a demand despite a rising rate environment even within the retail side, I find. I think, we found that historically. Glenn Schorr : I very much appreciate that. Thank you. Just one follow-up. So I\u2019m just curious, we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve \u2013 on this call, we\u2019ve revisit this several quarters ago. But I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re managing through the shifting landscape in broker-dealer land as we move from commission to fee-based. Historically, you\u2019ve had a good chunk of your assets on the commission side. I just don\u2019t know how you physically manage what you can do to influence that behavior in the channel? Gregory Johnson : Well, I mean, I\u2019ll start. I think the \u2013 and then maybe have maybe Jed jump in. But it does require a very different approach to how you sell. And I think, we have to \u2013 a very small portion out going into the traditional front-end sales charge brokerage account. And a gatekeeper is controlling what\u2019s available. And also what\u2019s available sometimes is put into a plan already for advisers to sell, I mean, as they recommend various buckets and pockets and move back and forth. So, the good news is, if you get shelf space, you\u2019ve got bigger opportunity. The bad news is a third or 40% of your funds may get on that shelf from before. So I think the net-net effect is, one, you\u2019ll see more mergers and consolidation of funds that may not be well positioned in a fee-based plan; and two, you\u2019ve had to add resources at an institutional level to have the right kind of people and consultants representing your funds to those platforms. So those have been the big changes as well as really retraining your sales force to not talk about a story and a fund, but talk about how a fund fits into a plan. I think, that\u2019s a very different tact and one that we\u2019ve spent the last, probably five years working on. Jed, add anything? Jed Plafker : Yes. No, that\u2019s right. I mean, you have to adapt obviously, especially in your service model. So on the fee-based side, performance is obviously going to be a big issue, but past that, it\u2019s helping advisers construct their portfolios for their clients. And so we\u2019re doing a lot of work on portfolio construction and portfolio construction tools and working with advisers to look at our strategies and products and how they fit into meet the client\u2019s goals. So as Greg mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of retraining and training going on upscaling of \u2013 and repositioning people, but still a good opportunity, I think. Gregory Johnson : And I think, the other is just making sure your \u2013 one thing is performance and other is fees, and the fee pressure from the \u2013 on the fee-based side is greater than ever as one of the attributes of any funds going to get on that platform. So we continue to look at any funds that may not be competitive on a fee basis and we\u2019ll recommend reducing those, I think, that\u2019s an outcome as well. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank Your. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Perhaps my first question, I mean, maybe a little bit of a technical question around taxes. But I think, your guidance for 2018 for your new tax rate, I guess, I think, it was 24% to 25%, I believe. Since technically speaking, your fiscal 2018 includes one quarter of \u2013 at a higher rate, am I understanding this correctly? So that 24% to 25% kind of a blended rate \u2013 a little bit of a blended rate that the kind of core rate going forward is actually a little lower? Gwen Shaneyfelt : Yes, that\u2019s right. It is a blended rate that on a pure statutory basis 24.5% applies to our year that\u2019s how it works for fiscal year tax payers. Next year, the rate that will apply on a statutory basis will be 21%. So obviously, we would expect for FY 2019, the rates go down. Robert Lee : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe moving away from taxes a little bit, I\u2019m just curious with Edinburgh partners that its Founder and CEO is also going to become the Head of the Global Equity Group at Templeton. But presumably, their investment process is pretty similar to what Templeton does currently. How are you thinking about the integration of the two? And is there kind of any thought or concern that gee, this leads to some, let\u2019s call it, asset breakage, if you will, in Templeton or elsewhere just as you kind of change up leadership there? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I mean, I think, first, if you look at their distribution channels and where their shareholders are, there really is not any overlap. So we see it as adding distribution certainly UK side, as well as they\u2019ve had very strong sub-advisory business here in the States without a big retail presence at all. So I think, they are complimentary as far as international value. They do have distinct styles that both are value-oriented, but both are distinct and some similarities obviously. But one that we view it as adding more value options at time when they\u2019re out of favor. And as value investors, we think it\u2019s a good time to add to our portfolio of value. And I think, the other is just somebody that we respect a lot to bring back under the Franklin Templeton roof, Sandy Nairn, who is highly respected in the industry, a real thought leader can just \u2013 can increase the profile overall of value and global equities for us and be good just another eyes and ears on what we\u2019re doing on both sides. So for today, there are going to be two independent brands and they\u2019re really sold through different channels. And we\u2019ll kind of figure out where there\u2019s any synergies or any new channels we could add. But for today, we don\u2019t, for example, compete in the sub-advisory channel, and some of that\u2019s due to fee issues with 40 Act funds in the States, where we can do that here with somebody who doesn\u2019t have that potential conflicts. So I think, there\u2019s clearly immediate benefits from a distribution side of having more value equity records that are sold in different channels. Robert Lee : Great. And if I could maybe just one follow-up, going back to really maybe follow-up to Glenn\u2019s question earlier. You think about kind of the intermediary channels, I mean, clearly, the SMA side of the business and their fee-based products in one place there\u2019s been some reasonably good demand at some of your peers and that\u2019s a product set that, I don\u2019t know I think you guys have always \u2013 my perception has always been as big and maybe some of your strategies don\u2019t lend themselves to the SMAs directly global bond or equity income. But can you update us on kind of your initiatives or how you\u2019re thinking about building more capabilities in that that product line to maybe kind of try to tap into some of those opportunities? Jed Plafker : Yes. No, that\u2019s \u2013 it is an area that we are actually looking at right now and looking to add some strategies in that area and some relationships. So it probably is an area that over the past few years has been growing and we haven\u2019t been necessarily growing with it and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at actively. Gregory Johnson : And I think, the other is just, it was always \u2013 I think, the portfolio management tools and technology are a lot better to compete in that wherein in the past it was cumbersome for the PMs and then pricing differentials, too, were a little tricky. So, I think, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s an area that is \u2013 will continue to grow. And the potential for tax efficiency within the SMA customized portfolios, I think, is another one that we are clearly looking at today that we can do in those type of accounts. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Gregory Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Harris : Yes. Hey, guys. If we get a uniform fiduciary standard out of the SEC, do you think that could represent another risk for industry flows and your flows in particular? Gregory Johnson : No, I don\u2019t. I mean, I think, the \u2013 a standard that that\u2019s the appropriate place to have a standard for the industry. And I think, it will be a more workable standard and probably one that that brokerage can coexist with fee-based. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any worse by having a common standard. But I think, the point that many of the major distributors have already gone down the path of adopting a fiduciary standard, we\u2019re with some of our distributors putting out share classes that do just that for them specifically. So I think, it to sit there and think, it\u2019s going to go back to the old way, it is not a fee-based, is the future in many cases and will be the dominant area. But I think, with the new rule, brokerage can survive and it doesn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m hopeful that it doesn\u2019t mean it has to be all at one price and you can have some reasonable differentials, that that I think is an outcome that we certainly favor. Christopher Harris : Okay. And then the question on global bonds shortly after the election here in the U.S., we had interest rates spike up and the performance of global bond was really good. We\u2019re seeing another move up in rates here in the U.S., but that it hasn\u2019t really necessarily led into stronger performance for global bond. So just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that why the key difference is there? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I think, this time it\u2019s just the euro, they\u2019ve been negative on the euro and that\u2019s been so strong and relatively strong around the dollar and that\u2019s been weak. So that\u2019s probably offset the duration relative attribution you got from rates going up and then Mexico with the NAFTA noise again kind of it\u2019s been bouncing around in that short-term period. So it\u2019s not like the funds losing any money or anything. It\u2019s just those that the move of the euro, I think, is the real dominant factor, as well as Mexico in that short period. Christopher Harris : Gotcha. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning. A lot of conflicting views on the broader M&A opportunity. On the one hand, getting through tax reform could unleash a wave of new deals. But on the other, with equity markets at all-time highs, the pricing for buyers and sellers still feeling very far apart. Could you give your thoughts on that conflict, and which side you think is winning out? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. I think, but the other side of that coin is that, when the markets are high, you tend to have more sellers, too. So you have more availability than you\u2019d have when markets are low. And the time you think now is the time to go strike, people aren\u2019t exactly selling unless they have a reason to. So I think, you will have activity and probably more activity. But like you said, there\u2019s going to be a certain caution when p multiples are at their historic highs across almost every type of equity out there. So I think, you have to be a little careful on how big of one you \u2013 how big of a bet you make in this kind of market. Patrick Davitt : Okay. And then on the China question, given your historical strength on the retail side, I\u2019m curious about your thoughts on getting involved in the qualified foreign institutional investor program, which I was a little surprised not seeing your name there, but wondering if that\u2019s in the works as well? Jed Plafker : When you say not see our name there, I\u2019m not exactly sure what you mean. We participate in pretty much all the programs that are available in China in one way or another. So \u2013 and that\u2019s something that we see will continue. Recently, the government has loosened some of the quotas and things that they\u2019re allowing. And so we are and we plan to increase that as we can. Patrick Davitt : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Gregory Johnson : Thank you, everybody, for participating on the call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Matt, and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. Ken Lewis, our CFO and me to discuss second quarter results. Although outflows remain a challenge, year-to-date flows improved significantly from last year and we remain optimistic because we continue to make significant investments to enhance our investment management processes, bolster our global distribution capabilities and build out our solutions. Given recent market dynamics including heightened volatility and a rising interest rate environment as well as cyclical nature of growth versus value, we believe that our investment teams are well positioned for potentially significant outperformance going forward. Capital management also remains an important area of focus for us. And during the quarter, our board declared a $3 per share special dividend and we accelerated share repurchases, bringing our total payout for the trailing 12 months to over $3 billion. Financial results also remained strong. Now, we welcome any questions you might have. Operator : Great. Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question here is from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks very much. So I kind of agree that you might see this switchover from growth to value. Curious on why you think we might not have \u2013 haven't gotten there yet. And then maybe more importantly, if you look across your whole franchise, why haven't we seen a bigger move towards being style agnostic across the franchise? Anyway, in other words, why it'd be in a position such that you are more exposed to style preference over time? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think both good questions, and I think the growth/value cycle clearly hasn't played out yet. I mean, the same stocks tend to keep bouncing back and you've had \u2013 you have more volatility there. I just think the macro environment is set for that as rates rise, and you're discounting future earnings with the growth stocks and, historically, value tends to outperform. And the one thing we are really seeing, I think an interest in right now is, you do have \u2013 we talked about it, more gatekeepers looking at funds and positioning portfolios and having more influence than the broad-based advisors. And we are getting a lot of interest in those traditional funds that actually have been underperforming in this environment, significantly in the three to five numbers that have had very good long-term numbers and much better downside protection. So, we are seeing a renewed interest on the shelf space side to position those funds. But like anything in the retail side, it's going to take some time to see the rotation really happen before you'll see the flows really happen. But we just believe right now that based on where the markets value and based on the backdrop of rising rates that that should take place and I think, as I said, it's being supported by many other gatekeepers. The question of value versus growth and it is interesting too, because I mean it's something we debate quite a bit and we'd have the same kind of, why would you have a fund that specializes in one versus the other. And looking at our performance and our growth area which is excellent, but it's just not as big as \u2013 to the franchise is the rest, so it gets a little bit less. But you look at the Franklin DynaTech, Franklin Growth Fund, Franklin Technology and the CCAP (00:05:29), all with just outstanding performance and record flows right now, but that doesn't offset the other side when you have the deep-value players like Templeton and Mutual Series. I think we thought of more core type offerings is something that we think about, but we also think there's solutions group and having more of a tactical allocation between the value and growth is a very simple alternative to just creating a bunch of new funds, where we can offer the allocation between value growth and really have core offerings with our solutions group, so that would be probably where we would address that. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Definitely appreciate that. I'm glad you brought up the gatekeepers getting more involved because I agree. How do they look at \u2013 how do they balance the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year with the 10 year? Like your performance is borderline amazing long term and the last handful of years is tougher. How do they balance that? You said they're looking at some of the better funds right now. I'm just curious on how that changes. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I mean, I think you will find it's all over. I mean, I've had consultants come in and clearly they would say the 10 year is the most important number. But they also recognize that the patience level and it's a little bit different of a time horizon on the retail side. So we think the 10 year is still very important and it's still measured. But I would say, the 5 year is probably weighted higher on the retail side. But many look at really \u2013 really try to evaluate the cycles and how you do over time. I mean, it was interesting for us, somebody was pointing out and it was a slide that they used in a retail presentation on the Barron's ranking overall for family and up until ninth (00:07:27), right before the last big reversal in growth value, we were last on the list for three years and then we were first on the list for the next five or six years. And now we're back to near the bottom of that because of the cycle. And they were just pointing to how important the macro moves affect an overall franchise when your assets are concentrated in one area. So that \u2013 I think his point in that slide was that, who do you want to partner with for the next 10 years? Don't look back on the 5 years. But to your point, I mean it's really \u2013 the 1 year is not very important, the 3 year and 5 year are, and the 10 year is right there as well. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Morning. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: First just starting on capital management, and actually I'll just ask two questions here. What is the level of excess capital that can be withdrawn after you make the $700 million debt repayment and the April 12 special dividend? And then secondly, could we see another special dividend over the next year? Or should we assume the $3 was it? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Right. So I think we were estimating, and it's in the filing too, that our kind of operational capital needs are about $3.5 billion, and then you could do the math where you could see all our liabilities. Remember that the dividend was paid in April, so that \u2013 you'd have to take that out of the cash number. All the debt, the tax repayment and all that, you'd have to factor all those in. And then regarding the special dividend, I wouldn't assume anything. I think that capital management is a long-term process. Being shareholder-friendly is a priority, we'll continue to \u2013 I think we have demonstrated and we'll continue to demonstrate that it's a priority. And so, over time, the board of directors will assess where we're at in terms of cash requirements and needs, and whether they should do another special dividend. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And, Ken, can you... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I would just add that, M&A activity obviously falls into why you have to be flexible in answering that question on what your intention is. And there's always a possibility of another one, but there's also another strong possibility of M&A activity. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Ken, how large is that tax repayment? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It's $1 billion. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Correct. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Got it. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: $1.1 billion. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you very much, guys. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Invesco announced like an hour or so ago, a pretty big insurance mandate loss. How big is \u2013 I guess maybe first, how is your insurance business doing? That had been an issue for you in years past. What is the latest in terms of AUM here? And what are the recent trends in terms of sales and redemptions? Thanks. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Their insurance business right now is $2.5 billion in the variable annuity. Is \u2013 sorry. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, it's more like $30 billion I think. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, I don't mean that. I meant like \u2013 I'm sorry, I meant the variable. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I would say, it's probably somewhere $30 billion to $40 billion. The redemption activity has slowed down. Still some of that at risk and we're really \u2013 we've been working with the insurance companies to come up with alternatives through our solutions group for more lower volatility type equity exposure in the markets and retain some assets through that. But right now not in a growth position, although we are seeing I think the viability of variable annuities going forward in the market and some of the repricing of annuities, and continue to have very strong relationships with the insurance companies and hopefully get that back into net inflow. But for now, I would still say, it's more of a potential net outflow looking at a year or two ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then on Ken, shareholder service fee expect to be flat compared with last year. I guess, is there a new level of seasonality in the March quarter. To get your guidance of flat, kind of need that to really pull back in the last half of the year, and I couldn't quite get there based on the description of how they're now calculated. So, anything there? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, last November we changed the model on how those fees are calculated. It's combination of fixed and variable, and the variable is related to transactions. And because of \u2013 in this particular quarter, we have all the tax transactions that have increased the seasonality of that line. So that should fade out and that's why we're saying overall year-over-year should be flat. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But next March and the March after and the March quarter after that, we should see the pickup in the first quarter typically. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So in terms of seasonality, the March quarter is going forward will be elevated and the rest of the year will be sort of depressed. Is that how we should think about it... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Correct. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...in years forward? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Correct. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. That was it. Operator : Year next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up. You guys put in some good clarity on updating your expense guide, and saw how Edinburgh is going to provide an uplift to some of those line items. Could you help us think about how we should be modeling the revenue pickup from the Edinburgh AUM coming on, what kind of fee rate, et cetera? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I think that, overall we talked about the Edinburgh acquisition as being not material to earnings and that's still true. I think what I've been doing with the expense guidance is, previously we've talked about some of the initiatives that we've invested in and that's why I've given the \u2013 I think the 5% guidance. And what I'm trying to do now is just to factor in all of the expenses. I wouldn't say Edinburgh Partners is a big part of it, but we had the severance in Korea this quarter and all that. So when you factor all of that in, that's why I'm giving the 6.5%, 7%, 7.5% guidance. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So, effectively Edinburgh being just one contributor there and not really a driver, and therefore the offset from revenue isn't going to be material either. Is that what you say? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Correct. That's correct. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. In the prepared comments, you talked about the pickup in retail redemptions outside the U.S. I guess, is there anything specific that happened like platform related or how should we think about the trends there may be going forward? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, I don't think there was anything trend wise. I mean, I was looking underneath trying to answer that question as well. I think you did see a pickup in some redemptions in Global Total Return, but you had clearly steady flows into the Emerging Markets Bond. And some of that pickup, just quarter-over-quarter, could have been a platform moving or a major reallocation in a platform because you do get that more in Europe than you do here certainly in the States. But no real underlying trends to report there. I think the performance is lagging a little in the short run, but picking up here in the last \u2013 this month, as rates are climbing up. And we also think still the defensive nature, this is a fund that kind of shines. And down markets, as it's not correlated with anything else, so hopefully we can get some absolute return in a tougher market environment and get flows back. But it just seems like right now the Emerging Market Bond Fund continues to get momentum versus the other two. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just to follow up on another comment from the release. You talked about an outreach program for at-risk assets. I guess, can you put some color around that, maybe how you size those at-risk assets and, I guess, how that outreach is going? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think that there is no \u2013 I think, again, the institutional is just looking at areas where you have had deep value and long-term relationships, and making sure that we are being proactive in meeting with those. And I don't think there's any one category, I think like at-risk, we \u2013 certainly on the VA side and that's where Ken's number came at-risk. We'd say $2.5 billion was the number that he came up with off the top of his head and that was the at-risk assets for this year that we just know based on the relationship that they may be shifting that to something else. And I think it's just recognizing everything's at risk every day, but certainly the deep value assets that have underperformed, we've got to get out there and make sure people understand how that performance should turnaround based on the macro environment. That's really the effort that we're doing with the institutional side. I think you have to recognize that a lot of \u2013 when you have big assets and styles out of favor a lot of your efforts are defensive versus going out and trying to get new business. You have to make sure you maintain the relationships with the existing business, because you're under pressure as well. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you. As a follow-up to Craig's question, it sounds like you're still optimistic on the M&A opportunity. Have you noticed any changes, I guess, in the willingness of sellers to sell through the recent volatility? And within that, should we think of the repurchase authorization as separate from the pool you're keeping to do M&A, or is it kind of a placeholder for capital return until something gets done? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It's the latter. It's a placeholder. It's not a separate part, no. (00:18:13) Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Right. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And I wouldn't say the volatilities changed the opportunities here; certainly not in the traditional space. But we are seeing more, I think, opportunities in the alternative side. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay, great. And as a follow-up, the management fee rate I think was probably a lot higher than people were expecting and you mentioned periodic revenue sources as one driver. Is that really just the performance fee, or is there something else there? And how much of that was really just driven by the average equity component? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. So performance fees, it was \u2013 it was our Romanian operation fund dual that was part of it and then regular performance fees. I mean, I think that the daily average assets under management kind of clouded the calculation a little bit. But the takeaway is that we're not really seeing a big dramatic shift in the effective fee rate at this time. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Carrier from Franklin (sic) [Bank of America Merrill Lynch] (00:19:23). Please go ahead. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks guys. Just one on capital management. Just given the pace that you have in buybacks and in the authorization that was announced, just trying to get a sense of what we should be expecting as maybe like a run rate basis versus where you can be opportunistic. And then still wanting to have a strong balance sheet in kind of firepower for M&A. So any color on what might be a good run rate, given the elevated level we saw this quarter. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Right, and it's a tough one to say. A lot's depending on so many different factors. So I don't think I feel comfortable actually saying that this is a run rate. I just say that it's a priority, it's a high \u2013 it's a continued priority to return capital to shareholders. This quarter there was a lot of reasons for the elevated repurchases. We might have better \u2013 we'd have \u2013 might have \u2013 next quarter might present more opportunities or less opportunities. So it's tough to say. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. And then, Greg, I think you mentioned in some of the commentary, some of the things you guys have been doing given the industry changes. So whether it's investments in the business, some of the M&A stuff. And so I just kind of want to get a sense, like when you look at what you're doing, say in 2017, 2018, heading into 2019, what are some of the \u2013 kind of the big maybe investments that you think can kind of start to shift some of the flow trends? Obviously, there is the performance aspect. But maybe take that away and whether it's on like the product side, the distribution side. Where we might be able to start to see some traction as we head into 2019? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think the investments that we have made and continue to make, recognizing the changing distribution landscape, and we certainly have added to the number of people calling on the home offices and gatekeepers. And we have seen I think results from that already, where we target the number of funds on platforms, and we've exceeded the targets for the year on making sure that funds are either maintained on the new lists for advisor platform. So I think that's been a very important area of investment. The ETFs is another very important area for us that we continue to build out. We added seven new funds in the last quarter. And have to have a separate distribution approach to that, so that's an incremental investment for the firm. The solutions team, we've added very senior people there over the last year and think that that's just going to be increasingly important. And now, in a position to really offer a better suite of multi-assets and target-date funds and customized solutions. And in the last quarter, we got a $300 million mandate in the multi-asset category, which is something we would not have been competitive in last year. I think the other areas around just data would be a longer term, but we have made \u2013 we bought Random Forest and really that's more of a fixed income effort now in the non-bank lending section. But just having the data scientists here and then building it out with each of our investment teams with the hub and spoke in India is going to be important in how we consider \u2013 or how we look at and build our capabilities in looking at data. So those would be a few of the areas. And then private equity would be another that we have \u2013 as we think about technology changes and disruption and fintech and we've approached it kind of the piecemeal and one-off. Well, now we have a much more organized way of looking at it, where we have a specific strategic pool of money, we have the dedicated teams that are actually raising private equity funds now, and we have partnership with a firm looking at data and AI investments, where we've already made a significant amount of those. And all of those help us, as we think about tools for our investment teams and better information and better data. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions around just investment and spending trends. I guess \u2013 can you, I guess, help us bridge the \u2013 and I know there's a couple questions in that, but what I'm trying to get to is, relative to the 5% in expense grow that you outlined last time, going up to the current range, how much of the initiatives kind of \u2013 so the Edinburgh acquisition, Random and the JV with Korea, how much did that add? And should we assume the rest is basically incremental growth spend? That's part one. And I guess part two is, as you look out at the next couple years, I guess where are we in the investment cycle? You guys are clearly implementing a bunch of new things. But just thinking beyond this year, what should be the expense growth for the foreseeable future? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think the \u2013 yeah, on the expense growth, the main part is like I said earlier, it's just kind of \u2013 given all of the activities that we've done \u2013 but I'm trying to just give you an estimate of where expenses will be in this fiscal year. Part of it is the seasonality also of the comp line. So, that's why I gave the specific guidance on the compensation, but that's just kind of in the short term. I think going forward, next year \u2013 and I made the comment in the remarks that it's a year for us to assess the investments and call those that aren't working and look for ways that we can kind of temper that expense growth to something more in the inflation range. So that's going to be looking forward for next year, and there'll be more to come on that the next time we get together. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just on that thing on the \u2013 just the last comment you... [Technical Difficulty] (00:25:55) Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Can you repeat the question? Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Can you hear me? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yes. Now, it's working. Yeah. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Just Ken, relative to the comment you made in the prepared remarks about assessing the investments. Just your view again of outsourcing the custody fund accounting and back in middle office. Obviously, custodian banks are talking about an increased trend of outsourcing from asset managers. I know you guys have always wanted to keep that in-house, because you can scale that. But is that something that is part of that assessment, or would you rather just keep that? And I guess also, how do you think about the market environment to the extent that if we do go into a bear market, obviously better to have a variable cost structure with that. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sure. And I think we have a nice \u2013 I do think we have a nice mix of fixed and variable comp. And I think also, as we mentioned before that our presence in these low-cost jurisdictions really does make a compelling argument for not outsourcing. But having said that, it's not something we do on an annual basis that assessment, but it's certainly something we do cyclically. And so, maybe three years ago we did that analysis and decided, oh, that we should make some investments for the internal systems. But going forward, we're going to continue to look at those things as well. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then question for you, Greg, on the U.S. retail redemptions this quarter \u2013 this first quarter or the March quarter. If you could maybe \u2013 maybe hard to do, but if you could parse that out between what you think is more due to the market conditions with the corrections we've had versus the platform, product line of changes at the warehouses and the other broker dealers. Just maybe your view of where we are on that platform consolidation for the industry broadly. I know we've done a lot of it, since \u2013 obviously since DOL. But is that \u2013 are we most of the way through that or do you see a lot more to happen? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, good question. I don't think there is any real quarter \u2013 or shifts in retail flows. I mean, I think you have the drag of the significant value assets and our larger funds, and then you had volatility in the first quarter for the first time where you had a big risk-off kind of moment there, and then a fairly \u2013 a decline in the market at the end of the quarter. So you did see a spike up in retail redemptions. I didn't see anything by asset class or product line really to call out other than you just \u2013 again, first time we've had some real volatility in the market. And I think we did a little better redemption rate wise through that period; and certainly, performance wise for that short period of volatility like we would expect with some of the value funds. And the other part of the question was... Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Was on the warehousing and... (00:29:16) Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Oh, right. Right, right, right. I think that's a good question and I was actually talking to some of our sales heads about that. And I think it's interesting this \u2013 the new, call it, the higher standard of conduct or new best interest standard that is under common period with increasing the suitability requirements and disclosure. I think what's important in the proposal is that, certainly brokerage, as it exists today, can survive and doesn't have to be modified to a level where you can't have differentiated commissions. So I think that's important. I think the other, obviously not being enforced by plaintiff attorneys is a good thing for that proposed legislation. And so, I think it would slow down the acceleration of movement from brokerage to advisory accounts. The urgency to do that would not be there, and I think that's a good thing certainly for our mix of assets that has high exposure on the brokerage side. So, I think the \u2013 we're not done, I don't know what inning we're in in this shift. It seems like \u2013 I was looking at one of our major distributors and partners and they probably had a ratio of 65/35 still a brokerage to fee base. But the other side of that is the new assets coming in are probably 70/30 fees. So I think regardless, you have to get your model positioned more for the fee side. But I think the deal well being vacated and some of the difficulties in complying with that rule, certainly will slow down that trend and brokerage can run off in a more reasonable way instead of having to convert. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right, and that gives us great color. And indeed, from the actual number of products on the platforms, do you see that continuing to come down significantly or do you think we've gone through sort of a house cleaning... [Technical Difficulty] (00:31:23) Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think we've gone through it, but I think the \u2013 clearly, there is less on there and that means that you have to rationalize your product lineup which is something that we've spent a lot of time in the last year, really looking at deciding what is going to be viable to continue to promote in the future. And that's really where the initial investments we've made and more relationship specialists and consultants have been important to make sure that those funds get that shelf space. But I think the \u2013 you have a narrowed funnel and the question is, how quickly the brokerage assets move to that narrow funnel and you'll have \u2013 that's where you're really getting some of the accelerated or higher redemption rates for your traditional base. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. okay. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: So it's a narrower funnel, it hopefully will not get much more narrowed. I don't think there's any reason for that. But really it's the speed of the movement, that's a question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And that's still coming, is what you're saying... Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...in terms of the actual flow, yeah. Yeah, okay. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yes. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I guess a question on kind of, I guess, retail distribution. I mean, some of your competitors have talked about other success they're seeing in retail distribution because of their SMA presence. Others have talked about how they've invested in building out that capability, because it kind of recognizes a need if they want to be in that distribution channel. And I mean, I don't have a sense that that's been a product lineup where you've traditionally had as much focus. So could you \u2013 do you think that's \u2013 maybe as you get the centralization on a lot of platforms of decision making and a lot more advisors shift to kind of SMA-type wrap products that \u2013 I mean, is that \u2013 do you feel that your position is you should be there? Is that one of the places you're focused on making \u2013 rolling out new products and making new investments? Just trying to get a feel for that. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I would say, yes. I mean, I think as we've said before, we do view ourselves as the content in (00:33:45) active investment management and the vehicle we're not agnostic to, whether it's commingled trusts, SMAs, ETFs. We're going to do all of that. And I think, now with technology improvements and efficiencies, we can do SMAs much more easily than we could say 5 or 10 years ago. So that is an area that I think we will continue to expand and offer more products. And certainly, the commingled trusts and flexibility with that is something we've been doing here in the last year. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great, and then maybe one last question, not to beat the capital management horse too much. And understanding you had the $3 special and the increased dividend 15%, I guess it was back a couple quarters ago. As I think of your kind of, let's call it, regular dividend payout ratio, it's still kind of hovering around or just around 30%. And if I think of your \u2013 many of your peers are kind of in that 40% to 50% range. And you now have access to worldwide cash. So I mean, can you maybe talk about just kind of your regular dividend? Is the goal just to kind of start low and just keep your track record of increases? Or is there a possibility that you kind of raise that normal payout ratio up towards kind of more of a peer average? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, when we talked about this at the February meeting, we talked about all the aspects of the dividend, the payout ratio, the yield and all that and the special dividend, shareholder preferences. We went out and talked to our major shareholders. And I think the answer to your question is, time will tell. The regular dividend will probably be a topic at future board meetings. And so I wouldn't rule out a larger increase, but I wouldn't count on it either. It's definitely a board decision. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, that was it. Thanks for taking my questions. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Katz from Citi. Please go ahead. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Lots have been asked already. Just in terms of coming back from a bigger picture perspective, Greg, seems like your verbiage is that you're still open to transactions, but you're \u2013 as a firm have been more tactical in approach, either in terms of what you've acquired or what you're building out. Where are you from a bigger picture perspective of a bolder move that might be needed to jump start growth? I hear you on the long-term performance, but you have great performance, but you're not leveraging that in any way across the platform, whether it'd be equity or fixed income. And I hear what you're working on a little bit. Is there something larger to do that could either accelerate earnings growth or accelerate the flows, rather than just sort of trying to see if some of these more skunk-work things actually get hold? And how do you think about the risks of something like that today? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think the risks are great to think about a large-scale merger and what you're left with. So I think that's again, as we've said, less probable. But you look at something like a K2 now that is generating $0.5 billion a quarter in net inflows. That's fairly significant to us in balancing some of the rest of it. So I think that those kind of incremental adds are still going to be very important to us. And the priority is to find more non-correlated alternatives that we can offer, specifically through retail and institutional. But we're open, as we always say, to look at everything that we think can jump start or be incremental. But I think the thought of combining two large firms that have multiple styles underneath them, gets a little bit daunting and risky for the shareholders and trying to understand who they are and what they do. So we, as always, have \u2013 are looking at many different situations and are finding firms in that medium size. We have done a series of smaller ones and sometimes they take as much work as the bigger ones. And so, we want something that's going to move the needle and we are seeing things more in that mid-size versus tiny or extremely large; and that's really what we'd like to do. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick one for Ken. Is there anything in your numbers here in terms of revenue recognition restatement some of your peers have had to sort of adjust certain fee waivers and/or distribution payments that may have affected the optics of reported numbers this quarter or comparably from prior quarters? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No. No. That's effective for us next year. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Thanks for the follow-up. It looks like global bond is top decile again year-to-date. The last time we saw improvement like that \u2013 I think post-election we saw a pretty quick kind of uptick in sales there. Curious if you're seeing that again, and if there's any reason to think that this period would be different than that period in terms of the improvement? Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I don't think it was \u2013 that's fairly short term and that was news to me, so I doubt the market knows it yet. I know we certainly had a big move in relative numbers in the last few weeks which I've seen. But I think it will take a little time. But again, I think the more volatility you have in the market and then people start looking for alternatives. And this is a fund that really \u2013 it was pretty obscure and small and so it had a 10-year record. During the last decade of equities, it was up 10% a year. So you really do have an alternative that can add some balance to a tougher market environment, and that's what people are looking for. And it's been competing with a ripping market for the last decade in places like Europe where it was an alternative to the euro. Euro stabilized, has been strong. So it's had a lot of headwinds just from local debt in its local markets, and that tends to be when it really does well in Europe. But in the U.S., clearly, we think it's an alternative category that if the markets get choppy and if rates go up, there is not going to be many places to hide and I think you can do very well in that environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just I want to clarify, one thing you said, Ken, I think about the \u2013 prior question about the revenue contribution from the recent deals. I think you said the expense obviously is going up from those deals. And then part of that was severance I think. And then, I guess, you said it was \u2013 if I heard it correctly, it's not material. So, is that a match of revenues and expenses or do we see a profitability profile for that next year after you get through the severance? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think it's material on revenue or expenses. I think that \u2013 I was just trying to \u2013 try to clarify maybe added more confusion, but I was just trying to clarify the effect of what's been done this year and how it will play out in future quarters. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, okay. So just not that big, okay. And then just on the cash, the $10.4 billion, if we look at that pro forma for the dividend payment, the tax payment and your bond pay down, we would be a little bit north of $7 billion, not including any other factors. Is that sort to make sure you I have that right? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And then, our kind of the money we put aside for operational regulatory needs, that takes it down significantly from that number. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, the $3.5 billion, right. The $3.5 billion that you keep for... Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Right, right. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. You see your excess will go to $3.5 billion basically. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: That is the reasonable conclusion. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: We don't use that word. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, thank you everyone for participating on our quarterly call and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Omar and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Hello and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Ken Lewis, our CFO. While some clear challenges persist during the quarter, investment performance within our growth strategies was very strong and net flows into our US equity and hybrid products improved. US equity sales reached the highest level in three years, driven by demand for a number of growth funds within the category. Additionally, we continue to make progress with several strategic initiatives to offer lower cost options to investors, notably in the DCIO space. Importantly, operating results remained strong with over 503 million of operating income generated on 1.6 billion of revenue in the quarter. We continue to prioritize capital return with elevated share repurchase activity in the quarter and a $0.23 per share regular quarterly dividend. We\u2019d now like to open the line to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler, Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : On page 4 of the prepared remarks, I see you adjusted fee structures in your A share, so I\u2019m just wondering how large is this A share from an AUM based standpoint and also what\u2019s the estimated economic impact in terms of EPS or revenues or earnings? Ken Lewis : Yeah. I mean, I don't think we have a number. I think it -- I would say, it would be nominal any impact. It's really just adjusting the payout schedule to be more competitive on the breakpoint schedules and we think the real impact would be in the lower duration kind of products where we've seen a lot of over million dollar sales, being competitive on the brokerage side of those still selling A share assets. So, I just don't think it is a number that would adjust anything at this stage. Hopefully it will if we get strong sales. Greg Johnson : Right. We think, it will increase sales, and if it does increase sales, then you would see the sales distribution revenue and expense line increase, which is a good thing. Craig Siegenthaler : And then just as my follow-up, I don't know if you guys did this intentionally, but it looks like you pulled the tax and commentary around the pipeline in the prepared remarks. I'm just wondering how did the institutional one up and not yet funded pipeline trend from next quarter? Ken Lewis : Well, I think that the -- was the question how the pipeline related back to last quarter? Craig Siegenthaler : Yes. So how did the institutional pipeline of one yet not yet funded mandates trend the current right now versus three months ago? Ken Lewis : Yeah. I think, for example, the big win for our local asset management in the UK, I don't think, we noted that last quarter. So that was an upside surprise, but I would say for, the pipeline came in pretty much, for the rest of the pipeline, it came in pretty much as we expected. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Katz, Citi. Bill Katz : So first question is just on expenses. Appreciate that you \u2013 sorry, some background noise. So just appreciate the guidance, as it relates to the fourth quarter on the G&A side. So I guess first part of the question is, where is the spend? It sounds like there is a little lumpiness to it? And then now that you\u2019re so close to the end of the year, how are you thinking about the growth next year, relative to the growth rate you articulated for this year? Ken Lewis : Right. There were a few one-time charges in the G&A, but there's also -- there was a bit of kind of expense trends going on in there as well. So that's why we gave the guidance. Some of it relates to sub-advisory expense, so you're seeing an offset to that in revenue as well. But I think that's probably the biggest driver there and so that's why we're giving that guidance for the fourth quarter. I mean, it's early in the budget process for us looking forward to next year, but our target is to try to keep the expenses under 3% growth rate next year, year-over-year, \u201919 versus \u201918. Bill Katz : And then just stepping back, you mentioned the priorities is cap returned, where are you in terms of the buyback versus sort of the stepped up repurchase you announced more recently. And just as you think sort of going forward from here, is buyback still the priority use for that within sort of the overall capital plan? Ken Lewis : Yeah. I would broaden the answer and say that, returning capital to shareholders continues to be a priority. And part of that is share repurchases. I would point out, this quarter, there are, we like to be opportunistic with our share repurchases this quarter. There was a couple of factors that kind of elevated the share repurchases compared to the previous quarter, one of them was, there was a pretty big spike up in volume during the quarter. And also we repurchased shares to cover any -- some share issuances that we had related to M&A. So a little elevated this quarter, but it continues to be a priority. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington, JP Morgan. Ken Worthington : And to follow-up on the capital return conversation, you\u2019re clearly returning a bunch to investors, but at the same time, the business is under tremendous pressure and you've got a tremendous amount of cash, gives you the opportunity to kind of redirect the business or buy your way into better growth. And you've done acquisitions, but nothing that I would consider transformational. So, how serious are conversations in the board room about leveraging the cash for more than just buybacks and dividends? And if the opportunity arose to do something truly transformational for what has been a struggling business? Greg Johnson : I mean I think you're dead on and I think I was going to add that to the last two bills, to Ken\u2019s response to Bill's question that when you look at capital, M&A is still the priority for the use of that capital on the balance sheet and I think the challenges that you mention and we all know with, whether it's fee pressure passive or just the move to advisory from brokerage will continue to put pressure on organic growth rates. So we are, as we said in past calls, very active in looking and that still would be the number one priority to invest the capital into growth channels and not make the priority just buybacks and dividends. And I think obviously, in those board discussions, our ongoing, looking at all aspects and all channels of growth and are much more interested in that discussion than the level of buybacks. Ken Worthington : And evidenced by what you guys have been doing, you guys have done a number of smaller deals, but they've been smaller deals and not sort of big transformational deals. If the right opportunity arose, is transformational something that would be under serious consideration or really is the better approach, do you think to kind of nudge the battleship and maybe transform the business longer term, using smaller transactions? Like I guess, it's been so long since -- like Franklin has done big, big transformational deals in the past, but it's been a long, long, long time since you guys have taken that approach? Greg Johnson : Well, and also very different organizations from when a Franklin bought a Templeton to where we are today, as far as the breadth of what we offer in as many places, so I think, the answer is that we continue and doing bolt-on, developing products whether it's alternatives and we're building out businesses like private equity. We want to continue to scale up the high net worth business, we've said that in the past. I mean I define transformational, but I think they are harder to do and of course, we are open to that, but I think combining with the company of this size, is very challenging to maintain who we are as an organization, but I think those discussions again are ones that we are open to but more probably you'll see continued investment in those other categories that can't be duplicated by passive strategies as a priority and then just again scaling up the businesses that we're in, we\u2019ll continue to do that. But I think as far as a transformational, whether it's two huge organizations combining, I think that that's more difficult, but we could certainly still do something in between that that would absolutely change the organization in a significant way. So those are all things we're looking at. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Maybe first one, just on the fee rate. It seems like there was a little bit of -- a little bit more pressure this quarter. Just wanted to get some sense, were there any other changes that were made in the quarter on pricing or was it more, whether it's product vehicle shift, that was just playing into that? Ken Lewis : I think one of the factors was just simply that there were some one-offs last quarter and that weren\u2019t -- that didn't happen this quarter, but we're not really seeing any major shifts and fee reductions in any of the major retail products. I think some of the institutional accounts are coming in, there's some free pressure on that we're seeing for new accounts, but nothing significant. Greg Johnson : And I would just add to the mix and if you look at the emerging markets that they were down 8% for the quarter, that probably counts as two or three times per dollar of assets. So that kind of move can have an impact on that line as well. Michael Carrier : And then just on the investments on the M&A front. I think you guys have said in the past that you look at a lot of opportunities, but it's also from a timing of the cycle, like pricing or valuations are a bit tougher. Just wanted to get your sense, when you guys go through that math and the calculation, how much do you focus on sort of the price being paid versus maybe the longer-term consequence of not pursuing those with the outflows continuing, the cash flow deteriorating. Just wanted to get your perspective on, how much is the current, maybe the K rate factor into potentially doing something. Greg Johnson : Well, I think, every target, if you will, every potential acquisition is bespoke. So, I don't think it's -- we look at it and say, oh, we can improve aggregate net flows, but we look at the opportunity set that potential M&A target presents and of course that would include where we think it will be improved flows in a certain sector and all that. Or a product or -- improve our investment capabilities, et cetera. So, I think, I don't know if that answers your question, but basically, it's a case-by-case analysis. Ken Lewis : And I would just say that first and foremost, we think our stock is probably still the best buy out there. So we'll continue to do that and I think the, we don't think the pressure that we've -- that we\u2019re undergoing, I think, in a rising rate environment, different kind of market, the value growth cycle, the 30-year spread of where we are of value versus growth, the strength of the dollar, all these things can mitigate some of the pressures that we're seeing on the current flows. So I think that that's, we don't think that's forever. So let's start there that we have to change the business. But I think -- and to your question on how we look at acquisitions and pricing, obviously, a smaller one, you can pay a higher multiple to get exposure to an area that you can grow quickly. I think, it gets more difficult when you're looking at larger deals at very high multiples and then the market becomes such a factor in how that works out in the next few years. So we're willing to pay up for talent in people and we recognize that it's expensive, but also at times, when things are expensive, that's when you have opportunities to purchase quality organization. So I think we're certainly open, if we think that it's a business that can scale to pay above market multiples. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon, Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I guess a little bit more on kind of the areas you're spending in and kind of opportunities for growth, headcount, if I just look at, some of the numbers went up 3.5% sequentially. I assume part of that's the deal, but I guess could you talk about, as you look in to next year with whatever 3% growth and we know is happening in the fourth quarter pick up like where those dollars are going, what areas you're investing in the most in terms of, I assume, for kind of future growth. Greg Johnson : Well, I think the key areas that are new channels for us and new products would be, first, would be the ETFs and that has been, build organically and grow and if we find the right acquisition to bolt on that, that\u2019s something we would certainly do, but the significant headcount in the ETF business as well as separate distribution there has increased the headcount line overall. Solutions is another area that we've talked about, having tactical asset allocation, having multi asset products and having better retirement target date, glide path, funds is a priority for us and we've added quite a bit of talent there. The institutional side has been a priority to grow that part of the business and we've added headcount in the institutional side and just the changing distribution landscape in the US, switching from your brokerage selling product to more of the consultative planning side. We\u2019ve really revamped and reconfigured our entire what was our retail distribution and have a New York Stock Exchange channelization focusing on the traditional wire houses with more of a planning approach. That has required all additional resources. So I think there's been a lot of areas where we\u2019ve spent and invested incremental dollars hopefully. We can find savings in other areas, but that's really probably three or four areas where we\u2019ve added headcount at more of the higher cost type of headcount. Ken Lewis : This is Ken. I would add across the enterprise, we've also been -- we forecasted years ago we've been increasing our investment in technology and you're seeing that come through the numbers. Dan Fannon : And then just a follow-up from the prepared comments about the 28 recommended list placements across the broker dealer channels this year or in fiscal \u201918. I guess, can you give us some context like, what is that, where was it a year ago, or kind of what's the bogey of it you're trying to get to, I guess, it's hard to get a sense of what that means on a standalone basis. Greg Johnson : I don't really have that -- those numbers to give you that context. I think it was really -- we tried to set specific goals and targets and that was one of our targets is to get that product placement. I think the importance, it really speaks to again some of the investment that we've made in that side, bringing in more consultants and building better relationships in the home office. And, we all know that, getting the product place doesn't necessarily mean you suddenly get flows coming in your funds, but what it means is you'll have that pipeline when the market does turn and when people are looking for, whether it's value or other styles that could be out of favor right now. We want to be on that platform and it also helps you retain assets, when assets are moving from brokerage to the fee base, you need to be on that plan or on that platform, but I don't really have a number to give you what, in terms of how many platforms or it's just -- it was a goal that we set a metric that we set out there for that team and for them, they hit it three quarters of the way through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe, Greg, if you could talk a little bit about the broad strategy in global equities in the Templeton franchise with the acquisition of Edinburgh Partners. Does this change how you're thinking about either managing the Templeton Global Equity franchise or delivering the product? Greg Johnson : No. It really doesn't. I think it -- it allows us a little bit more flexibility with pricing where Edinburgh has done a good job, building sub advisory relationships that Templeton wouldn't be able to price to with the existing assets in 40 Act funds, so that gives us a new channel to distribute the value side. I think having the resource of Sandy Nairn, who is a highly respected person in the industry, one that we know well, we think can only be helpful on just the overall Templeton side, but there's no plans to do any combination and we think the benefit of accessing a growing distribution channel in the sub-advisory side that we can leverage our distribution to do that. And I don't think there's any other plans, other than having the standalone entities with the benefit of Sandy there with helping with Templeton side. Brian Bedell : Right. So more of a bolt-on and leveraging that extra capabilities, rather than any kind of transformational move? Greg Johnson : Exactly. Brian Bedell : And then just, Ken, one on expenses. Just wanted to make sure I had this correct. I think the top of the expense growth guidance for this fiscal year, if I'm correct is about 7.5% and that was for me, an expense base of 2.0 billion, am I correct on that? Ken Lewis : You are. You are. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo. Chris Harris : Can you guys talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in Asia? That's been the one region for you guys that\u2019s been growing the fastest, at least on an AUM basis. So maybe you can elaborate on what you're seeing? And then also related to that, is China loosening up the restrictions an opportunity for Franklin down the road? Greg Johnson : I mean, first of all, I think the -- if you look at our distribution around the world, Asia continues to be the areas that are still having net inflows in a tough environment for our traditional strengths. So I think that markets like Taiwan and India continue to grow and are generating positive sales. I think the China question on, they have announced the intention to allow the minority owner in your JV to become majority owner. We don't have exact clarity on when that will happen, but we are having discussions with our partners and that's always been our intent to do that. And then I think once you have control of that, that I think enables you to put further resources in on building out distribution there. So, I think everything probably is on a little bit of a holding pattern right now with some of the trade issues on giving clarity around that. I don't expect to see that, but from everything we've heard, we expect that to be within 12 months that we'd be able to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Lee, KBW. Robert Lee : Maybe following up a little bit on capital management and deals, I mean some of your competitors have made investments and acquired various types of digital, have a digital strategy for distribution and otherwise and you've talked in the past a little bit about some strategic investments, small, but strategic investments you've made in different companies. Can you maybe update us on how you're thinking of, do you see a place for a digital strategy at Franklin, I mean, is that a possible path you could go down for future M&A? Greg Johnson : Yeah, I don't know if we need, I think it's absolutely a path that we are continuing to develop a strategy on, we're doing direct in some of the markets around the world and are doing it in a very efficient way in a market like India where it's probably a quarter of our business there direct. So we've been building that out. I think the robo piece is fairly simple. I don't think we need M&A to do that on top of it. The digital tool, capabilities and customizing service levels, those are all things we've got people working on actively. As we said before, we have an investment in some different robos around the world, different companies like advisor that do financial tools that are high net worth fiduciary trust is looking at leveraging there. So we are experimenting with it on various channels and developing, at this stage, we still have a lot of accounts that are direct, some that came through mutual series and it would be just a better way to service those accounts where we could have 30 billion or so of no advisor record accounts and think that a robo -- some type of service there makes sense. So I think like most firms, we think first and foremost, that technology is going to help distribution, help partner with the advisor, provide better tools for them to more efficiently serve more clients, so that's the first goal, but then we're thinking longer term about how we can also service those direct accounts as well and whether it's in the US or other markets, we\u2019ll be thoughtful about how we roll that out. Ken Lewis : And I would just add that that is an area that we've been increasing expenses and investing in, so that\u2019s been part of the expense growth. Robert Lee : Great. And then maybe as my follow-up, can you update us on your ETF initiative? I mean, where does it stand now and now that you've been at it for a while, I mean, do you feel like it's meeting your expectations, particularly the low cost kind of country specific strategy that you start with, so just kind of progress update. Greg Johnson : Yeah. I think it's moving along, it's probably in the range of 2.5 billion I think roughly today. And we are still early in rolling out many of these strategies in terms of distribution. Our goal has been to get on platforms. We continue to make progress there and every -- seems like every month or quarter, we're being approved on new platforms, some just take -- may take three years to get on, but others we can get on a little bit faster. So, I think the progress has been good to date and one that we just recognize, will take a little bit of time and actually sales support to grow, but we are seeing decent growth at this stage. And in June, we kind of had a targeted campaign to grow awareness at the RA channel institutional. So, and also we\u2019re marketing ETFs through print ads and digital, and compressed advertisement, et cetera and we launched three active ETFs last quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Question for you regarding non US retail distribution broadly and I guess specifically focusing on UK market. I know it's been an area where you haven't had a lot of presence in the past. I don't know if a number of changes this materially, but given some of the more structural changes unfolding in the UK retail market, is this still a priority for you guys to try to expand there or not as much? Greg Johnson : I would say it's a priority and one again that -- one that we have identified to market that I think in the past, we felt that our core strengths around global equities, there were plenty of global equities in that market. So it's one that we really didn't put a lot of resources in, but I think now, what I think what changes, we look at the size of the market and the potential still for us. So it is a market that we made a strong hire to run that effort there and we're putting more resources into that market. So I think despite some of the changes that one could argue make the retail sales a little bit more difficult, it\u2019s just too big of a market for us to ignore. So we are building that and we've been very successful with our local manager there and have very strong performance in UK equities. And just in the last quarter, as we mentioned, we got an institutional win, over $1 billion, which again I think validates the strength of that local team. Alex Blostein : And just a follow-up question around expenses. So I heard your comments in the near term and kind of as you started to think about \u201919, but I guess in an event of a downturn, can you help us think through what you would be able to scale back on, granted you're obviously trying to pivot the business toward some of our faster growing areas. So where would be the flexibility in the expense base and what are some things you would need to pull back from, if we see more of a prolonged period of tougher markets? Ken Lewis : Yeah. I will address that two ways. One, you can kind of -- we've had these downturns in the past and you can kind of see how reacted. I think there's that level of flexibility, if we needed to do it, we wouldn't -- we don't want to do it, but if we had to do it, we have that level of flexibility. But part of the process that we're talking about and part of -- incorporated into my trying to keep the expense growth minimal, next year is to look at investments that we've made in the past that maybe aren't panning out and call operations that we don't see the benefit in performing a certain service and all that. So we're looking at all of the areas to see where can we create savings that we can reinvest because we do want the actual incremental growth into new things to be above the 3% guidance that I gave you, but we also want to fund that through some savings from outdated processes and services. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys, Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Just wanted to follow up on M&A. As you think about the opportunities out there, what sort of a hold back or hesitation, as if the largest side acquisitions at this point, have you gotten close on anything and if so what\u2019s happened? And as you think about any sort of hesitation, is it price of you on the cycle in terms of where we are, does that kind of factor into consideration and is there a view to maybe be a bit more patient on M&A, wait for a return in the cycle and then kind of get a better price, how do you sort of balance the near term versus medium term of a better purchase price? Greg Johnson : Well, I think, first of all, we did close two deals last quarter, so it's not like we're not doing anything, although obviously not of the scale. You're talking about, I think, we have been as active as we can be in looking at multiple deals and you only have so much capacity if we\u2019re working -- even if it's a number of partners, that's going to take resources and tie up for a bit to close that. So I don't think it's -- price is always a consideration of course. I mean, that's going to be one. It could just be what we think is not the right fit, not the right culture. We're concerned about where we are in cycle in the business, all factors, all of the above, but not anyone stands out. As I said in earlier answer that again, if it's an area that we think we need to be in and we've got an opportunity to bring in a quality organization, we're going to pay up for that. So I don't -- we don't have any set number that says, gee, it can't be -- has to be accretive in year one or it can be, those are factors that we're going to think long term and try to just bring the best in and would hopefully isn't overpaying too much. Ken Lewis : As Greg mentioned, price is always a factor, but that's the benefit of having a strong balance sheet that if we see an opportunity that we think makes strategic sense, we could just get it. Michael Cyprys : And just as a quick follow up, I think I may have heard you, your suggestions were building on a private equity business, if you could just talk a little bit more about that and some of the alternative capabilities that you're building out organically, how that's progressing, what we can see next there? Greg Johnson : Yeah. I think the -- for us, we've been in private equity in other areas with Templeton and for a while, it's really the US side that we've developed and part of it is, the growth, the private markets, having analysts that build strong relationships here in Silicon Valley and just seeing a lot of opportunities on the private side. That's one that we just said it made sense then to start a business. I think the -- and the fund is not a big first fund, but at 50 million, it has significant outside investors that recognize our access and strength on the analyst side here in the Valley that that made sense we're doing and we're also looking at AI and big data and have some partners there that we're bringing in to do that. And I think just, we're trying to take advantage of our location and the strength of our technology team here in San Mateo. It's very hard to go out, as you know, to go buy a private equity firm. I think that's -- we see that that's extremely difficult, again, if the right situation came up, we would entertain that, but I think building it organically, taking time there and just building strong records is what we want to do. The other alternative side, the K2, we didn't talk about that, but had an extremely strong quarter. Whenever you see the kind of disruption in the market like we did earlier in the quarter, we tend to see a strong interest in the alternative category and they've had very strong results on a relative basis and on a flow basis and had a major win last quarter as well. So that's another business within the alternatives that continues to grow. And then other categories that we're looking at on the M&A side, we'd like to build the larger real estate group within that. So that's certainly something that we've been looking at deals and recognize that that's going to be an important category. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just wanted to come back to a couple of comment that was made. On the balance sheet, in terms of M&A, it sounds like it will be, you would be looking for doing any deals, strictly in cash. So maybe just given us an update on what you view as excess cash on the balance sheet. And then you mentioned also building the ETF franchise potentially through acquisitions, so would you consider a large transformative ETF acquisition, relative to your current footprint there? Ken Lewis : So let\u2019s see. We had net cash, net of debt, it\u2019s about 7 billion and we think that, as we disclosed, we need about 3.5 billion for regulatory requirements, internal uses, so that leaves about 3.5 billion. The other question was, would we purchase a large transformative ETF? Greg Johnson : We would consider it. There's not many of them out there, but we certainly would be open to the idea. Brian Bedell : And then also you mentioned in the deck, strategy sort of in the collective trust area and that is obviously growing area. Can you size sort of your AUM in the collective trust or at least, to what extent, you are either transitioning mutual fund assets and to collective trust structures or actually just getting new sales with collective trust in DTIO? Greg Johnson : I think right now, we have 6 billion in the collective trust and I think as you know, the flexibility of what we can do pricing, it's like an R6 class. So it's a lower cost alternative and the pressure on fees within the retirement channel, we just find this to be a very strong vehicle, well suited to do that and also the flexibility of combining and building within your solutions group, using trusts, it's more flexible than a 40 forty Act fund. So we have seen strong interest there, on specially the DCIO channel and have built strategic partnership with another firm that allows us to kind of plug and play those funds into an existing -- already existing platform. So I think, our retirement group felt like there was 10 billion in the pipeline. I'm not sure what the probability of that. But 10 billion, that right now that they've identified and working on within the DCIO channel, but obviously, I think the market itself is like 2 trillion or something like that. Brian Bedell : And then just in the formation of that 6 billion, is that mostly new money to Franklin Templeton or was a good portion of it switches from your own unusual fund? Greg Johnson : No. Most of its money that's been there for a while that we use that vehicle for the institutional side with Templeton. So, those funds have existed, but where we're seeing the incremental growth now is really the, what our group is excited about is just the opportunity within the DCIO channel to have a more competitive pricing structure and we seem to be getting a lot of interest there. Brian Bedell : So just maybe if you can characterize the environment in July, I mean, obviously, we've seen the other companies talk about net outflows, a lot of them have come from lumpy sources. But maybe with the uncertainty in the markets on trade and everything, if you could give us a flavor for what your sales teams are hearing from financial advisors in terms of retail appetite for funds and maybe any kind of July flow, early July flow outlook if it\u2019s possible? Greg Johnson : Yeah. I don't have much color to offer there. I don't think we're seeing any significant shift at this stage, but probably consistent with some of the other remarks that have been made. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible], Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Just going back to the 28 recommended list placements, is that a gross number and on the flip side, can you talk about like funds, what are you seeing as far as funds maybe getting consolidated off list for you guys and the industry in general? Greg Johnson : Yeah. I think it's probably a gross number as far as new placements and I'm not sure how you would net, if you have a new advisory platform that it's really getting on those. I think the -- I'm not sure we even keep a statistic, if you went off, it's really once you're on it and most of these are new lists that, and you could argue, if you go from the old open architecture to a new list or you off that list or on, how you'd calculate that because everybody who has had access before, it moved, it's really when they set up their new advisory platform and you're absolutely right, it's a funnel, it's a narrowing of what's available and that's why it's so important and meaningful to get on that, because if you're on it, the opportunity to get greater share is there, because you're not competing with thousands of funds, but we all know the downside, if you're not on it, the brokerage assets are more vulnerable to redemptions as they move to advisory. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Katz, Citi. Bill Katz : So a three part question. How much -- where do you stand right now in terms of remaining A, B and C share exposure in the US? And then as you've repriced now into the A class share, where are you like within sort of your peers in terms of that pricing? And then if you are to be successful and sort of realign yourselves, so that you are better flowing versus the brokerage to advisory shift, what\u2019s the economic impact on the business as you look ahead? Greg Johnson : So, when we look at the, first of all, the pricing was to make sure that the pricing was competitive with our competitors and if we just -- it's effective, it'll be effective the next fiscal year, it will go into effect. And in terms of the economic impact, it's hard to quantify. Certainly, there's a cost, but it's only a cost if it results in increased sales. So that's a good thing to have. So we\u2019ll have increased assets under management and you'll see the sales distribution and expense line go up as a result. Ken Lewis : And some of it was just being consistent as part, adopted even their brokerage model or adopted it to more of a, trying to get a consistent pricing model. For example, we have a new class that would just make -- we were an outlier with the lower 12B1 at 15 on some of our funds and we've had to move them to 25 because that's the standard pricing for that asset class within certain advisors that had to have that. So repricing there doesn't really have that and that won't have an impact financially other than hopefully generating new sales. It's really just some of the tweaks within the payout structures and more flexibility around the million dollar pricing that -- and hopefully that leads to larger tickets and better sales, but we don't have an exact impact number, because as I said earlier on a call, I just don't think it's going to be material for a while there. And I just don't think it's a material change in any way. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Johnson for closing remarks. Greg Johnson : Well, thank you again for everybody attending today's call and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, good morning and thank you for joining today's call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year results. This year marked a period of significant investment for the company as we reevaluated several facets of our business, continued to invest in ongoing strategic initiatives, and expanded our capabilities. These investments contributed to lower operating income this year, but we firmly believe we now have the appropriate organizational structures in place to meet evolving client needs. We also returned more than $3.5 billion to investors through dividends and buybacks, in addition to that used for strategic acquisitions to enhance and expand our investment capabilities. Our heavy mix of value-style funds weighed on flows, but we are optimistic about our flagship products' performance moving forward, as we've seen very strong performance in our key global macro and global equity funds into the quarter-end and into October. With me today is our CFO, Ken Lewis, and we also have some special guests here to discuss this morning's exciting acquisition announcement. I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Benefit Street Partners' Chief Executive Officer, Tom Gahan; and President, Rich Byrne. Tom is dialing in from BSP's offices in New York, where he's been meeting with his team, and Rich is here with us in person in San Mateo. Tom has been with BSP since the beginning and previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank Securities, and Head of Corporate and Investment Banking in the Americas. Rich also previously served at Deutsche Bank Securities in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer for a number of years. We're excited to welcome these talented people to our firm and we hope you find their participation on today's call helpful. I'd like to now hand it over to Tom for some opening remarks. Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Thanks, Greg. Rich and I are happy to join the call this morning to discuss the partnership we're building with Franklin Templeton. We both believe that Franklin will be the perfect long-term partner. I can tell you that on behalf of the entire BSP team, we're super excited to join this world-class global organization and combine our alternative credit products and investment capabilities with Franklin's tremendous investment platform. We believe this combination will serve to augment our investment capabilities, while accelerating our growth prospects. All five of our core strategies have significant and secular growth opportunities. We believe that the Franklin umbrella will improve our information flows, also expanding our origination capabilities. In particular, we look forward to working with Franklin's global distribution platform to offer new products with extremely attractive risk-adjusted returns to their clients. In short, this is a win-win for our team, the combined platform, and most importantly, our investors. In addition, Franklin's long history of successfully acquiring platforms, while maintaining the strengths and independence of the investment processes, give us confidence that this will be a mutually beneficial endeavor. Our investment team and process will be unchanged and the team has strong, mutually aligned incentives to continue delivering best-in-class returns to our investor base. Our conservative investment style will mesh well with Franklin's focus on long-term value creation for investors. In conclusion, we feel fortunate to be navigating the markets and future opportunities with Greg, Jenny, and the entire Franklin team as our partner. Thank you. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. So with that, we'd like to open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. How are you? So I like Benefit Street and I like the space. Never mind there's big concerns about too much growth in private credit. I think there's a big ramp if you do it right. So, a little more question on what \u2013 I get what Benefit Street brings to Franklin. Could we talk a little bit more about what Franklin brings to Benefit Street? Does it expand distribution and which parts of it? And this might be a stretch, but I know I've given you heat over the years of how you have this great retail fixed income platform, but never really grew a big institutional platform. Could Benefit Street be a launching pad towards a bigger institutional public fixed income as well? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I'll take that. This is Greg. And I think the immediate opportunity for us looking at our worldwide distribution network, the relationships we have with sovereign wealth funds around the globe, I would say that Benefit Street has been very successful growing with a relatively small distribution group and relied some on third-party distribution, where we think this asset class in this environment with floating rate, first lien, more defensive characteristics is very attractive to institutions that are concerned about rates, but need fixed income exposure. So, we clearly see this as a growth opportunity, where immediately we can plug and play this with our institutional network and then explore the retail channel, whether it's a high net worth channel or looking at the type of interval funds or closed end funds that could be attractive in the retail space. So, we think there is immediate demand and opportunity for our distribution channels. And I'll turn it to Rich if he has any additional comments. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Sure, Greg. I think the way we think of it at Benefit Street is Franklin brings a lot of things. Tom mentioned some of them in his remarks, but it's pedigree, global reach, distribution, balance sheet, and information flow. So if you think about it, we have a number of alternative strategies. We think they generate some really attractive risk-adjusted returns, to the extent we can aid in our sourcing or information flow through the analyst at Franklin and all the other things that it brings, that's great for our ability to deliver returns to our investors. But as far as delivering our products to a broader set of investors, our footprint on institutions, we've raised $26 billion over the 10 years that we've been around. But our footprint just isn't big enough and this deal comes at just the right time for us. And I would add, as you said, on the retail side, the only products that we have that really touch the retail market at all are two permanent capital vehicles. We have a publicly filing, but not listed BDC and mortgage REIT. And to the extent we can tap into the massive retail distribution here at Franklin, those are big growth areas as well. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And maybe, Tom, you could expand on. I think the institutional opportunity for us, we think this is the final piece is having the full platform of credit available and we're seeing more demand in the institutional space, where you have mandates, where you can be tactical in moving between different categories. Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean, we're definitely seeing increased demand for the products that we manage and we're seeing increased demand for effectively commingled structures that take combinations of what we do. Markets are always constantly changing and opportunities are constantly changing, and having that type of flexibility is becoming more and more important to our investor base. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Okay. And one final thing, anything you could tell us about performance on \u2013 it's going to sound ridiculous, but how you know these guys are good and what record are you looking at that you can show us over time? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think we, obviously, did a lot of due diligence and looked at the records. And also, more importantly, we looked at the structures and downside protection, and I think that our first reaction like anybody is, hey, we're late in the credit cycle, and that was our first reaction and even my initial discussions. And the more we got to know the business that we think this is really in a great position to benefit from any dislocation. And we haven't talked about, but it's not just private debt, it's distressed, it's long/short credit, it's high yield, it's other sectors that we think can do very well. And I think the important part of their business model is that the funds are more like private equity type funds, where you have \u2013 you call on capital, there's dry powder there, you get market dislocations, you can have fresh powder put into the market. That's very different than the daily valuation, which has to sell as redemptions come in. So I think we looked at the defensive nature of how the assets are positioned and captive, and that was very attractive. And also the lower leverage on the products versus the industry averages and the fact that this is one of the groups that has been doing it for a while since the global financial crisis and you have a lot of new entrants kind of coming in now and they've done it, done very well through the entire cycle with less leverage than others. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : All right. Thanks for all of that. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee of KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and maybe like drill into the Benefit Street a little bit more. If I'm reading it correctly, financially, you're only buying the management fee stream and not buying the incentive fee stream. And any color you have kind of around \u2013 I'm assuming they're going to work as a kind of stand-alone entity, even though you own 100%. Kind of any color you may have around kind of their current profitability and margins? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I'll take the first part and then maybe turn it to Ken on detail. I think the carry is the same carry percentages that existed before. So a percentage of the carry goes to the team, a percentage goes to Franklin, and none of that's changed. And I think that \u2013 and the majority of the carry goes to the team, 60%, and 40% to Franklin. So, yes, performance fees are still very important in the equation of the value and accretion for this deal. And I'll have Ken talk about the numbers. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Greg. So when we looked at this deal \u2013 and I know in the commentary we talked about that being neutral next year. I think the first thing to point out is when we're talking about accretion, we're talking about GAAP accretion. And so, while it's neutral, next year under GAAP basis we do see it accreting over time in the 5% to 10% range going forward, and that's on a GAAP basis. If you were to back out noncash items, it would be a lot more accretive, which I know some of our peers do. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Is it possible to get some sense to that? I mean, in terms of as we model it and kind of think about that cash generation. Means... Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: ...is it tax benefits or what we'll see next quarter. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, we don't think this will close, first of all, until like the second quarter. And then in FY 2019 we're saying it's neutral, but it should start to be accretive in the second year. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And is all the $26 billion of assets fee generating? And kind of any color on what is the size of the kind of uncalled capital that's not earning fees yet as kind of the dry powder? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, we can have \u2013 yeah, we disclosed run rate revenues, so that's one thing I'll point you to. And I think maybe Rich will talk about the dry powder. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah. The capital that we have under management, $26 billion, is we have \u2013 as we mentioned, most of that \u2013 actually over 85% is long life capital, meaning that it's either in a drawdown structure or in our permanent capital vehicles, et cetera. We lever our funds \u2013 our two most recent funds, our flagship private debt fund, our distressed fund. We have actually some other funds as well. I have not finished drawing down all their capital yet, so we still have a fair amount of powder and \u2013 in that runway. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: That's $2 billion in dry, $2 billion to $3 billion. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. And then if I could \u2013 I appreciate your patience \u2013 maybe back to the core business. Ken, end of the year, kind of looking ahead, what are your latest thoughts about kind of what we should be thinking for expense growth next year? I mean, previously you wanted to hold it down to, I believe, less than 3% or \u2013 that's still a good number? Where does that stand? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: That's right, Rob. So, we finished our budget process in August/September, and that process was consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter that we were budgeting expenses to go up 2% to 3%. But no sooner than was the ink dry on that that we started to look towards ways to get that expense growth down. And then, with the recent market activity, we're accelerating that. So, we do think that \u2013 while the budgets, we're projecting to grow 2% to 3%, we do think that there are opportunities to reduce expenses more. And so, even get it down to half that perhaps or even more than that. But just a word of caution there, some of these things \u2013 these levers that we have, and we do think there are several of them, they're a little bit \u2013 take a little longer to pull, and they take a little longer for the benefits to be seen through the P&L. Having said all that, because of the cyclical nature of the expenses, we do think next quarter we should have flat expenses. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Maybe first one just another question on the Benefit Street Partners. Just when I think about the $26 billion in maybe like the management fees, is that mostly on commitments or NAV? And then any margin color. And maybe for the team, like Tom, just wanted to get your sense, it seems like there's more \u2013 there's, obviously, structural growth, but there's a lot of like competition coming into that market. So, just how are you guys looking at deploying capital, given where we are in this cycle and how the structure is of some of these products kind of protect downside? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Maybe I'll have Rich address that. And, Tom, you can jump in at the end if you have anything to add. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Sure. Thanks, Greg. We have a number of products. The one that people seem to ask about the most is around private debt. There undoubtedly has been more competition there, spreads have tightened, there's been some new players, but a couple of remarks. One is, everything we've read, it's probably the most unallocated asset class within alternatives, certainly relative to PE or real estate, et cetera. So, every projection we've seen shows that market considerably growing, almost doubling over the next five years. And despite tighter spreads and somewhat weaker documents, we still think for the most part across the continuum that we run \u2013 remember, we're sort of a credit ecosystem always looking around relative value. It really is the best risk-adjusted returns for the most part that we see across the credit spectrum. And the only other thing I would add, and maybe if Tom wants to chime in here, is size matters. So, there may be more competitors in the market. Some stats we looked at recently is less than 20% of all the new funds formed are over $1 billion. Size really matters. Size matters because of the size of the teams. I mean, this is a very labor intensive business, private debt. You just have research analyst doing a lot of work for you. You have liquid markets to sell to. Oftentimes, we're the only lender. So, size matters as far as size of teams, monitoring, and all that, but it also manages commitment. So across our platform, almost half of our AUM, about $12 billion, is in private debt, means that we can commit up to, and in some cases even above, $300 million per deal. Remember, the average size of deal we're doing on a middle market loan is a $30 million, $40 million, $50 million company. $50 million EBITDA companies don't need $25 million. They need commitments of multiple hundred millions. And believe it or not, there really aren't that many providers out there, the banks aren't in that business for the most part, that can do that. And so, I think what you'll see over time is consolidation. And for us, hopefully, under the Franklin umbrella, just make us that much better at doing our job, and that's just private debt. Of course, we have a lot of other strategies which benefit from the same bank disintermediation, and a lot of the same fundamental factors that does private debt. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Tom, do you want to add anything? Are you... Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah, I can add just quickly. I think one on more of a sort of technical question I think you began with, on our private equity style funds, fees are charged undrawn as opposed committed capital. We think that actually places us in sort of a much better position with our investors. That's how they work. But I think just echoing Rich's comments that scale matters, and we have 50 people that are originating, we can write checks of multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. When we're talking to financial sponsors, owners of companies, management teams, and we can say, look, we can underwrite your entire cap structure, we can underwrite acquisitions, et cetera. That direct transfer mechanism is becoming more and more important. And we think that the combination with Franklin is going to sort of further elevate us and continue to separate us from the smaller players who just can't do that. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Ken. Just on capital, so you guys were active on the buyback. You did this transaction. Going forward just wanted to get a sense. I know you guys have a ton of cash and you generate a lot, but just from a priority standpoint, does this change anything in terms of the pace of buybacks that you guys have been kind of run rating? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sure. And I think we did see the buybacks slowdown this quarter. I think that's \u2013 the trend, all things being equal, would have continued. Of course, that could be offset with the market right now. And so, as you know, we're pretty opportunistic. But we think that this acquisition and our buyback practices are consistent with our historical practices. If you look back what we've done with the year, after tax reform we've had almost 200% payout of earnings this year. And this is consistent, this acquisition. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: So, I would just say the answer from our perspective is this acquisition doesn't affect our capital management program and I wouldn't relate it. There's a little slowdown quarter-to-quarter. It wasn't because of this deal... Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Correct, right. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: ...on cash. There's plenty of cash for buybacks. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz of Citi. Please go ahead. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on the transaction to both parties. Just sort of on that, I just wonder if you could just maybe peel back one more level here on the economics of it. It sounds like there's some money upfront, some money down the road. Just trying to tie back to your GAAP neutral, and then some improvement on the other side of that. Maybe talk a little bit about how much is paid upfront and what some of the milestones might be in terms of earn-outs and when that might be, what kind of margin are we talking about, and then can you quantify the intangible amortization. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sure. I think the margin in this business are extremely attractive. And over the next few years, that will be largely offset by retention programs. Just a little bit about the deal itself, we have the $683 million initial considerations. As we mentioned earlier, the key employees will still accrue the majority of performance fees, and they will also participate in retention programs. We stagger the vesting over the next six years, with the more senior individuals having the longer vesting periods. And the partners will invest, as we mentioned, 20% of the after-tax proceeds. So if you consider the commitment to invest in the future funds and the deferred programs, approximately half of the total consideration is backend loaded and we think that's aligned \u2013 and including the carry. And so we think that all the interests are aligned there. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And I would just add. I think, for us, that was a key point in the structure of this deal that based on the ownership structure allowed us to put much more of the consideration to employees and vesting over time. And I think like any deal you do, where it's one thing buying the company, it's another thing to be sure the key people are going to stick around. I think in this case, we would say that there's a higher probability of people staying, because the incentives are better for them than the prior structure, and nothing's been altered. It's just been more attractive with vesting over four to six years. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And senior management will enter into a non-compete and non-solicit agreements too over a six-year period. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up \u2013 thank you for that. My follow-up question this sort of stands on the core business as well. So when I look at the gross sales dynamics, they continue to weaken both quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year. However, could you give maybe a little bit more color around any kind of intra-quarter trends that you may have seen in terms of, given the performance has improved as the quarter sort of unfold a little bit? And then any sort of color, what you're sort of seeing just given the turmoil that's continued into October? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I would start by, for us, we've always felt that with a large base of value assets, you need some market setback and sell-off and volatility to get the value back in favor, and rising rates certainly, as we've said before, historically in that kind of market value tends to outperform growth. So, if you look at September/October, it's probably the strongest overall performance we have had relative to our peer groups in the industry. And even to me, the immediate where I think we could turn flows fairly quickly, it's still our top selling funds would be around the global macro, global bond, where in this kind of environment where you have the uncertainty, you have rising rates, and in the last probably five weeks we picked up close to 600 basis points against our competitive universe here, and have a positive return the last 12 months. So I think that's the one to me that from a flow standpoint that I think could turn fairly quickly. I think the others, we have better relative numbers with Templeton, with Mutual, as you'd expect, in this kind of market, but I still think it would take a little bit more time to see that translate to sales. I think the immediate opportunity is still what has been our big driver. And if you look at the last time we had the global financial crisis and coming out of it in the last decade in equities, that's where the global bonds did so well. So, I think that that story will be attractive. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And that said, we did see a slight pickup in U.S. retail sales even last quarter. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Ken. How did Benefit Street's private credit funds perform in 2008 and 2009 in terms of realized losses? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I'll let Rich take it. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Easy question to answer. We're exactly 10 years old, so we really started at the \u2013 I think it was a couple of weeks, right around the Lehman demise. So at Benefit Street, we don't have the crisis in our sphere. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And I think maybe it's important just to point out, and maybe Tom or Rich, I think our first reaction was the same kind of question, well, CLOs were a disaster during the global financial crisis, but again when you really look at and understand the difference, these are not mortgage-related CLOs. They're not CDOs. And actually this asset class performed \u2013 it was one of the top performing fixed income classes during the global financial crisis. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: So, Tom, you want to add anything on that? Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Sure. Yeah. I mean, so from inception we've had virtually zero losses. Obviously, it's been a pretty favorable credit environment, but there are plenty of losses out there amongst our competitors. With respect to sort of what's going on in the broadly syndicated loan marketplace, CLOs, et cetera. If you look back to the actual returns of CLOs through the GFC, the returns are amazingly strong. Since then, the structures, CLO 2.0, have gotten stronger. We are very conservative in the way that we underwrite credit. And we believe that the CLO structures are going to be able to weather any foreseeable downturn in the marketplace and still be able to protect investors in those structures. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: I'll also add... Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just a quick follow-up here. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Wait. We just had one \u2013 Rich has one quick comment. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah. Maybe embedded in the question is where we are in the cycle now. Clearly, the market's exhibiting a lot of late cycle behavior. If you look at our portfolios across our platform, you'll see a very different construct. Right now, in our private debt strategies, we're, give or take, 90% senior secured top of the capital structure. Loan-to-values are across our platform around 50%. In fact, in our most current fund, our flagship, we're investing now \u2013 excuse me, it's under 50%. So, we've got a lot of dry powder. We think the portfolio is very defensive. As Tom mentioned, we've had a de minimis amount of losses since inception. And the point I made earlier about the \u2013 that most of our capital is long life capital gives us the ability to make disciplined investment decisions during market downturns and not be subject to flows. So, this is a fixed income business. Credits generally have limited upside and lots of downside. We're managing for that downturn and, frankly, are looking forward to it. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, guys, very comprehensive. Just one quick follow-up. What is the appetite for another special dividend around year end, just given that tax repatriation is no longer a hurdle? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's just one of the quivers and the arrows that we have to look at. And it's a board decision, as is the regular dividend. And I don't think, as Greg pointed out, nothing's really changed in our capital management policies or practices. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: So, yeah, it would be under consideration and we'd get feedback on it as we usually do. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So maybe first, what kind of balance sheet or liquidity risk does Franklin take here with this acquisition? Maybe to what extent does Franklin buy a balance sheet with Benefit Street with CLO tranches or other balance sheet investments in the Benefit Street funds? And then what sort of liquidity provisions do the products have here? And how confident is Franklin that it won't have to step up to provide customer liquidity, should trading in the underlying investments dry up when customers look to redeem? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: You sound like one of our board members. I think these are exactly the right questions to ask when looking at these types of investments, and we've done extensive due diligence around any potential liability or balance sheet issues. And really, again, the key here is the structure, where it's private equity-like fixed. You have terms of seven years with the private debt funds. There is no liquidity issue. They're in there for seven years, so you don't have a meet a daily redemption type of step-up that you could have in a 1940 Act Fund or any other vehicles that have daily liquidity. These are very much, whether it's the REIT or BDC permanent capital. And so, we really looked at that carefully. We looked at the liabilities, If there were any that related to these instruments in the GFC. And really felt strongly that that hasn't been an issue certainly even with the CLO side going through the GFC, where the management companies have had any liability or any kind of issuance. And also the structure around \u2013 whether it's a partnership with funds \u2013 again, we don't have the balance sheet issues of having to put it on our balance sheet. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And there's no investments in the Benefit Street funds at all (00:34:05)? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yes, there will be, but \u2013 yes, but for us, that's something we modeled out and looked at. It's a small percentage for the type of funds that we would normally do, and I think our view was that it wouldn't exceed. If we hit all of our growth targets and assets grew and doubled in size, our maximum at any one time would be somewhere around $230 million, $240 million of capital. And we think that's a pretty good use of the $240 million if that's where, better than sitting in 2% treasuries. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, can you give us a little background on the seller here? So, I guess, my assumption in Provident (sic) [Providence] is a seller here along with management. Maybe, what's the history and why are they selling, if the outlook for the business is so good, as you've represented, why do they see now as the right time to be transferring a lot of the economics from them as the owners to you, as the new owner? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Tom, do you want to take that one? Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Sure. Yeah, listen, Providence has been a great partner and they're with us from day one. Our business has become larger and more complicated. We have capital needs and distribution needs that really couldn't be fulfilled by our existing partner. I mean, they're a sector-based private equity fund, really successful at what they do. And we determine jointly that it was probably the best time to start thinking about bringing in a partner for us for the long-term that could really help us on sort of that pedigree, that global recognition, access to distribution, capital to seed, new products, new teams, et cetera. And this was just a natural time to sort of do that, given our growth and sort of how much our business is so different from what they do. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Maybe to tie in a lot of the comments on Benefit Street and after a couple of questions on it. Financially, Ken, I think you mentioned you thought over the long-term this could be 5% to 10% accretive. I guess, just if that's GAAP or non-GAAP? And then you guys have sort of given us some good detail here on the structure in terms of the $683 million, that amount being half of the total consideration. But I think you also mentioned, carry as a component of that. So, just trying to get a sense of what \u2013 if carry is a significant part of that versus actual cash laid out by Franklin. I think you also mentioned the assets doubling over time in a four to six-year timeframe. So just wanted to, first of all, try to get a sense of that on the financial side if that tie into the 5% to 10% accretion. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Seems there's a lot there. Let's see where to begin on that. So, first of all, it was kind of a long-term endeavor here. What I was saying was that the team will \u2013 they're participating in majority of the carry, and that is \u2013 will align their interests, the different components, as I mentioned, over six years. And that is why we're saying it's neutral in the beginning, but over time \u2013 could you repeat some of the questions... Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, no worries. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: ...or just repeat the questions? Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, no worries. You're answering part of it. So as we go to the four- to six-year timeframe that you sort of talked about, and you also mentioned sort of a goal of assets doubling in time, it sounds like some of the incentive is going to be the retained carry by the teams, and then some of the contingent consideration will be cash laid out like a typical earn-out structure. And is that coming into that 5% to 10% accretion? And, I guess, that 5% to 10%, do you see that as sort of \u2013 not in 2020, but more like four to five years out? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I think, yeah, my time horizon was about four or five years, and it included all of that in my numbers and it was GAAP, as I mentioned. So, if you backed out the noncash components, the accretion would be a lot higher than that. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then, sorry, did you give the amortization... Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Sorry. No, we said that's \u2013 we'll give more details on those on the next quarter call in around. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. And then on the growth side... Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. So next quarter when it closes, we'll give some more guidance on individual line items. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's great. And then, I guess, more broadly, just the cross-sell that this can \u2013 I guess, your sort of idea of to what extent you can sell this into your institutional channels, particularly on the insurance side, which clearly has increasing need for liquid credit. And I think you also mentioned retail product structures as well, although, obviously, I would think they would have to be more liquid. But do you have plans on launching it with retail products? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think those are absolutely all attractive prospects and we have a team that calls on the general account insurance business. This would be a natural quick fit. It's not that complicated of a story for, I think, a generalist institutional team to go out and at least talk about and see if \u2013 like, whether it's sovereign wealth fund where you have relationships around the globe. This is a natural category. And even \u2013 my interest \u2013 it was interesting on why, I felt like this category was one we had to look at. I was just sitting on two endowment boards and the consultant came in and said, we're going to educate the board on private credit. I said, hmm, this is interesting. This is a category, and again, because it just fits so neatly into this rising rate and having more quality around it and the attractive yields you get by eliminating the bank, I think it is very attractive that way. And the retail side, whether it's the high net worth side with fiduciary is an easy first introduction. But we've already seen interest from our traditional retail channel around whether you have an interval structure or a closed-end structure. I mean, those are all things we will explore right away, and we think that we can do that fairly quickly. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great color. Thanks. Just one on expenses, the base that you're growing from, Ken, for the 2% to 3% growth for next year, is that expense base $2.16 billion? Do I have that right? (00:42:06) excluding the sales and distribution expense. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I'm giving you the number excluding the sales and distribution and marketing line. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's $2.16 billion for fiscal 2018, unless there's other one timers in there? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I'm not \u2013 I think that's about right, but I think you should just verify that with Investor Relations later. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, will do. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Thanks, guys. Could you maybe just step back and give us an idea of the process for the BSP discussions, evolution, who went to who, was this investment banking driven? And should we take this to indicate that there's a healthy pipeline of similar deals out there as you've kind of gone through these processes? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Clarify that, how did we \u2013 oh, the BSP. I thought you said the BDC. Okay. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : No, no. BSP, sorry. How did the process play out? Yeah. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. This was not an auction or a book or somebody going out and saying, we want to sell to the highest bidder. This was a \u2013 came from relationship of one of our board members with Tom and introduced us and just thought this would be a very interesting fit, because he's heard in our meetings how we want to continue to build our alternatives business. And he personally knew Tom and his team and knew Rich and David, and just felt like this was the right cultural fit. These guys have a long history of working together. Our people knew many of their senior people going back to Merrill Lynch days in high yield and things. So, I think that got us off to a good start in the discussions and our first reaction, like many, where we were late in the credit cycle know and the more we understood the business and the opportunities to benefit from any downturn with distressed and long/short and just the conservative nature of how they're running their business, we got very comfortable and very excited about it and that's really how. And we did a lot of due diligence, because it's a new area for us and for all the questions that were raised on this call around capital, any future liabilities, all those things we wanted to be very careful about. So, I think that's really how it came, but it was not a bidding process at all. And I think the point is, we've said before, we're open to any deal that looks like it has quality people, a quality record, and it's an area that can grow. And I think that's \u2013 we looked at this business and just feel like there can be some bumps like all credit areas have, but the middle market corporate business is one that \u2013 it's hard for the banks to get back into and it's a big market and we think very attractive in this environment. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a quick one, I may have missed this earlier, but did you give the weighted average tenure of AUM? I imagine it's in the kind of five to seven-year range. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: It is, but that's really the private debt side. I think there is permanent as well. So maybe, Rich... Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah. Each of our strategies is different. For private debt, our funds are long lock-up funds, generally seven years. On the BDC and the mortgage REIT, those are permanent capital vehicles. They're publicly filed, they're not traded at the moment, but we plan on listing those and think of those as any permanent capital vehicle. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one; I don't think you touched on this, but when you spoke to your assumptions \u2013 this is on the BSP transaction. When you spoke to your assumptions about year two accretion, could you let us know what credit trends are embedded within those assumptions? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. The assumptions are that there would be future fund launches that are consistent with past fund launches and growing slightly. So, maybe like 1% or 2% or 3% growth in those fund launches, and that was the major assumption driving revenue. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I'll... Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: We looked at downside scenarios, but we didn't really for \u2013 to say, what does the credit world look like next year, and I think the assumptions for those numbers are more where we are today, more or less. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Right. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then, given the fact that there's leverage used in these funds, can you give us an idea about what kind of loss tolerance there is before the earnings stream to Franklin would be impaired from some of these? And then given your response to Ken's question, I assume that means that Franklin is not going to be providing the leverage to these existing funds. But you made a reference to maybe launching a few products that might be a bit more aligned with the core business. And in those scenarios, would that be a situation where Franklin might be the provider of that leverage or are you guys staying away from that altogether? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: We don't envision providing leverage to the products. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say that we have no plans in providing the leverage. And I'll have maybe Rich address the leverage. Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah. Our funds are relatively light leverage certainly as compared to many of the peers in our spaces, different funds little different. On a private debt side and our BDC, we've run leverage of well under 1 times; will vary throughout the cycle, but anywhere from 0.5 to 0.8. More recently, in our earlier vintages, it was actually substantially even lower than that. Our bilateral providers in private debt and in some of our other products are the banks you'd expect them to be, Wells, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, et cetera. In our commercial real estate business, we take advantage of warehouses and CLO financing as they take out to our warehouses. And again, those are bank lenders that we take advantage of across our platform. We enjoy a lot of relationships across the street. Hopefully, that will even get better with our \u2013 post acquisition. But, no, we don't envision doing anything on a lending basis with Franklin. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. I guess, Ken, given your accretion assumptions, are you thinking about going to a non-GAAP reporting on a go-forward basis? And then also if you could just give us some context of what performance fees have looked like over the previous couple of years for this business? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, regarding the non-GAAP disclosures, that will be part of our analysis when we get closer to closing on it. We analyze that every year, frankly, and it just hasn't been material enough to make a compelling argument. This may change that, but we'll have to wait and see on that. In terms of performance fees, historically, it wasn't a significant part of our valuation or projections going forward. We don't include a significant part of performance fees when we were talking about the accretion calculation. So, I think that's probably the essence of your question there. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Performance fees, you need to put in context, this is not a private equity-type structure and they're more probable and less as far as upside. And maybe, Tom, you could touch on that just a little bit on where that expectation is around the performance fee. Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.: Yeah. Sure, Greg. Well, obviously, it's a function of the marketplace and the opportunities. I'd say that our \u2013 when you think about performance fees for private debt vehicles, the debt product is very different than, say, the private equity product, whereby private equity you can earn multiples of your investment, while debt you're lending money and the goal is to get your money back plus a reasonable return. And so, we think about debt multiples or fund multiples or multiples of money being anywhere from about 1.4 to a 1.7, potential outliers out at 2 times if you're in a more sort of interesting credit environment than we're in today. And in terms of historicals, we generated sort of market-leading returns in our debt vehicles and we hope to be able to continue to do that. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. And then, just as a follow-up, in the core business, Ken, just thinking about the fee rate decline this quarter, I assume mostly because of mix. But, I guess, as you think about next year and kind of the outlook for the next 12 months, how should we think about the fee rate? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think one of the factors was that the daily average assets under management, which a lot of the funds are calculated on, was lower than the straight monthly due to the volatility. And I think that was kind of a factor going that reduced it. Going forward, we're not seeing a significant \u2013 we're not projecting a significant decrease in effective fee rate over 2018. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. So the first one, I guess, on the deal, as you look out and you guys articulated this earlier some of the potential revenue synergies with Franklin's distribution, as you kind of compare and contrast to some of the other deals you guys have made, whether it's K2 or some of the others, what's sort of different about this one from a distribution perspective? And, I guess, what worked well versus what didn't work well in your prior experience that you could try to do something differently with this one? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think this is a fairly simple story compared to \u2013 like, K2 is a little bit more complicated and liquid alts of fund of funds and do a retail channel. And we've been very successful in fundraising that area, but there's been, I'd say, some headwinds institutionally that we knew about on the standard fund of funds business, so, we've been kind of evolving that. But when I look at the amount we've raised in Europe and the U.S. in the K2 side and continue to be one of our areas of positive inflows and growth, I mean, I think that's done okay. I think this is just an easier story as far as getting out there and telling exactly what this team does in an asset class that may be relatively new, but one that people can understand pretty quickly what benefits it has and getting an adjustable rate with X return above where the market is. And I think institutions, the benefit of the lockup is important too, the liquidity factor of getting that extra yield by having it held over a seven-year period or so. I think that's something institutions understand and can easily do. I think it's a little longer in the retail channel, but I just think this is more mainstream, I would say, than a more complex fund of funds type product of a K2. But again, I think as far as we look at the billions we've raised in retail with K2 and continued to do that, especially in this kind of market, where the other factor were the fund of funds in a lower vol product in a straight up rising market, it doesn't look that attractive. It starts to look attractive again in the kind of market we're seeing right now. And that was the same in Europe. We saw a real pickup in interest when we had some volatility a few quarters ago and now we're seeing more interest again. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And our team also sees an opportunity to expand on the RIA relationship base through the BDC and the REIT products. So it was another \u2013 they were excited about that. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. That's a helpful angle. So second question, Ken, for you just around expenses, so I just want to make sure I understand the message. So 2% to 3% probably a little lower, so it sounds like you guys are aiming to do closer to maybe 1% to 2%. Tell me if that's not right here, but that's what it sounded like. I guess, taking a step back, if we are in a little bit more of a choppier market backdrop, let's just say zero beta, could expenses go down or do you guys think you still have a fair bit of investing you guys need to do to sort of drop expenses this kind of 1% to 2% range? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: I think there's opportunities for expenses to go down, with the caveat that there's not a lot of what you might reference as low-hanging fruit. So, the opportunities are there, but it's longer to identify and longer to execute. But we do think there are opportunities to reduce expenses, and just sort of some examples. And looking at the strategic investments that we made not just in the last year, but the last five years, and just assessing them are they successful, should we be doing something different, there's the easy stuff like tamping down G&A expense. We have a large component of comp is variable. And then just looking at our investment management distribution capabilities that maybe aren't operating at scale, can we be more efficient, increasing automation, increasing our global sourcing in low-cost jurisdiction. That's just to name a few, but there are clearly opportunities that we think can reduce expenses. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just hoping you talk a little bit about the private equity JV in Asia, if you could talk about your new partner out there, how you're thinking about building out the business, what sort of goals/objectives do you have, how are you thinking about the opportunity set there, and why start with fund of funds, which has fees on fees? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think it's somebody who we admire who has built a very strong business with Asia Alts and we've a local, Melissa Ma, who we've gotten to know and respect and somebody who has a very strong following. And I think if she wanted to partner with us to build a broader based PE fund of funds, she brought the kind of people in that have that expertise and relationships and has the ability to go out and fundraise without a lot of help from us to get started. I think that was all attractive. And willing to put her own capital into it along with management, and doing really a JV that way. And I think it helps us get to know different segments of the institutional marketplace, where they've historically been strong and introduced relationships, as well as helping us with our nascent private equity effort in how we build out that business, having that expertise of somebody who's really dealt with all of the best ones over time in certain regions. So I think those were a lot of the reasons along with it's another alternative capability. And I think it's just having the opportunity with the management team that we knew and not a real drag on our existing distribution system, where we think it can be up and profitable pretty quickly. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up question, if you could just talk a little bit about your solutions business. I know that's been a strategic priority of yours. If you could just update us on how that's progressing, where we stand in terms of AUM, what's new in terms of hiring, new products, goals you have for that business looking out the next couple of years. Thanks. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're extremely excited about it and we've made some great hires and two high profiled people that along with Ed and have built a lot of new products within there. And I think, more importantly, immediately we've seen the benefits with some of our \u2013 the variable annuity changes, where they may be looking for a lower-vol equity-type product, we now can save some assets and move them into as some of these ones wind down and that's what they're looking for. And we've been able to do that in certain cases. It also allows us \u2013 we've combined many of our different groups with risk premia and quantitative into systemic kind of quant. We've been able to build our factor-based ETFs, which are doing extremely well on a relative basis. And our U.S. multifactor one is up to 400-plus million dollars, and that's really a benefit of having that capability within the solutions group. So it really has pulled a lot of pieces together. And I think the other part is just the ability to offer various types of sleeves that could be attractive in many of the different models that are out there. And as the market evolves from a product-driven place to more of a outcome-oriented solutions basis having specific solutions that can fit, whether it's a technology platform, those are just getting more and more important as these technology platforms get in between the end investor and the advisor. And we've got to figure out ways to get on that shelf space and solutions really helps there. So, I think we look at it as we're fully staffed now, we've built the products, and we're going out to market with them. And I think the immediate benefit is really some of the ETF help, but also just having different customized options available for some of the insurance relationships that we've seen a direct benefit. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Peche of Ranmore. Please go ahead. Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Mr. Johnson, during the last call, you said Franklin was quite possibly the best buy out there, and I happen to agree with you. And with the share price some 10% lower, can I ask why the board hasn't been accelerating the rate of buybacks, as price has fallen and/or indeed even considering taking on debt to repurchase this potential portion of the company at the current value, which looks to be around five times normalized earnings, excluding cash and investments, especially given the change in value growth cycle, which looks to be under way? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. No, all good I think points, and there are volume considerations and you can't just go out and buy. And I know that your next question will be, why don't you do a tender or something with that. I think those are all things we talk about and consider, and I guess I was wrong last quarter if the stock's down 10%. But we... Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.: No, just early. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: But we are looking at all of that and I think the management \u2013 we and our board feel strongly that a one of the strongest balance sheets is going to be a weapon for us for creating value over the long term and having options in \u2013 as we enter a more uncertain period with a strong balance sheet is where we want to be. And capital is something that I think we \u2013 again, as I've said, I think the high rating is attractive to institutional investors, and not having debt on the balance sheet as an investment company we think is very important. And I'll let Ken if he wants to add anything. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Just add I think \u2013 I'm sure you're aware that the board did increase the share repurchase last February, so... Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.: Yes. Look, I must commend you in how patient you've been, because many of your peers, who've been less patient, don't have the ability to take advantage of the low prices that are currently out there in the asset management space. But one doesn't want you to miss the opportunity. And perhaps as evidence of the growth value cycle having turned, I'd point out that Franklin Resources has substantially outperformed Amazon this month. But is the market right to be fearful of a substantial acquisition or should we expect more smaller bolt-on type acquisitions of the type announced today? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, as I've said before, I think large acquisitions are very difficult. There's a lot of risk in them, and just the brand and who you are as a firm. But I think, again, if the right situation came up, where you think you can take out a lot of costs and create value, we're going to certainly look at that and be open to that. But I think as we've stated before, I think today we're over $40 billion in alternatives. We'd like to be bigger in that. So, yes, if we think things \u2013 if there's attractive other businesses to fit into that category, that's one we want to continue to grow. And part of the attractiveness of BSP is having the kind of people that are plugged into the Street and relationships and see different things come up that could be interesting for us. And I think that that \u2013 Rich and Tom are builders and entered a lot of different areas just starting at private credit, and that's the kind of talent, again, that I think when you have in the organization, you're going to get a lot of new looks at some new businesses and we're going to continue to do that. Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.: Perhaps just one last question. Has Franklin been approached by I know a number of large banks and financial services companies, Goldmans and the likes, are looking at increasing their exposure in investment management? Has Franklin been approached in that regard? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, we wouldn't say \u2013 I mean, I think there's always conversations, I think but we don't really talk about whether we've been approached or not formally or informally. Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.: All right. Thank you. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee of KBW. Please proceed with your follow-up. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks for taking my follow-up and, I guess, I just had a question here. I guess, at the beginning of the call, Greg, you mentioned that you kind of felt you had kind of a lot of the structures built that you need at this point, and I know you talked about the solutions business. But can you maybe dive a little deeper into that, where you're referring primarily to kind of building out the CIT capability or are there some other businesses that we should be thinking about that now you feel you're in a better position to go out and accelerate marketing? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, I think it just allows you to leverage \u2013 when I look at our business and say, you've got all these lines and you've got all this expertise in so many different places, and having a group now that really interacts and has the kind of people at a level of experience that the rest of the CIOs respect and work with, it helps us in a lot of areas. It helps us just in how we communicate our views on where the markets are and tactical allocation views, where clients want to hear that. And part of our \u2013 I think the difficulty we've had in delivering that as a firm has been that we were somewhat siloed and are, and think that's important with investment teams to have independence. But we also have to have the ability to leverage and be tactical across these different groups to add alpha over time, I think that's what they're doing. And I think the customization that's out there, whether it's commingled trust like you mentioned, whether it's separately managed accounts, these are all businesses now that we have more flexibility in addressing customized demands from clients and interest and whether it's retirement income sleeve or an inflation protected fixed income piece. We can do all that much more efficiently now and having that I think. And even just the disparate pieces we had with quantitative and risk premia groups and AlphaParity now all under one group, it's much better organized and, I think, simpler for the clients to kind of understand. So we just think that's going to be more and more important as we move from this product-driven brokerage world to more of a solutions outcome and technology-driven world, where they're going to be looking for specific tools to build the portfolio, and that's really what solutions allows you to do. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your follow-up. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Real quick, just can I always ask you this, the cash balances of $6.8 billion, looks like that is net of everything, but what portion of that do you view as excess excluding the working capital needs, which I think are still significant in overseas? Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: We like to call it opportunistic capital. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Or an ammo. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Ammo, yes, even better. Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.: And our current estimate is that that number is between $3 billion and $4 billion. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, another one I usually ask you, but since you mentioned the cost save (01:09:35) ability to potentially reduce costs, the outsourcing of some of the fund administration, you \u2013 obviously, we saw the Oppenheimer/Invesco deal and a large part of that $475 million of cost saves they're getting is from outsourcing what has been internally done in Oppenheimer. Any consideration on your end for doing that, or is that part of what you're thinking about for the potential to reduce costs, or is that still a decision that's sort of in the distant future? Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: No, it would absolutely be something that we would look at, as part of that exercise. So, that's a part of the laundry list that I went over. Having said that, I think it's important to keep in mind for us the low cost base that we have, because of our presence in low-cost jurisdictions. So, we're an outsource provider. It needs to be global and it needs to be at a pretty cheap price for it to be compelling for us, because we have our low expense base and cost base. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.: Well, thank you for attending our call today and thank you, Rich, for coming out here and Tom participating, and we are certainly excited about the future with Benefit Street Partners. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Brenda and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining today to discuss this quarter's results. Ken Lewis, our CFO is here with me, as usual, to discuss our financials, and we also have Rich Byrne, President of Benefit Street Partners, available to address any questions on the alternative credit markets as we're set to close on the acquisition this Friday. Market volatility clearly impacted our financial results this quarter. In fact, the net effect of the mark-to-market, which is predominantly unrealized losses and other income, was more than $83 million this quarter. Fortunately, this environment has been more conducive to the success of value-oriented investment strategies, including many of ours. We are pleased to see our relative performance continue to improve with net sales improving notably in several of our flagship strategies this month. Lastly, we remained active with our capital management program and returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the quarter. I would now like to welcome any questions that you have. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Looks like in the prepared remarks you're guiding to expenses being down in 2020. Could you walk us through the puts and takes of that, versus investment need and how you can get comfort that the expenses can come down after being up in 2019? Ken Lewis : Sure, Patrick. This is Ken. So we've been working in the last couple with all the business units to identify areas where we can leverage efficiencies and kind of fund all of those investments you referenced. So the result of that exercise is that, we do think through cost cutting initiatives that we will implement this year that, we'll be able to get the run rate expenses to be at or below the 2018 levels and still make those investments -- the strategic investments that you referenced. Patrick Davitt : Okay, great. Thanks. And in that vein, I guess, is there a chance that some of that could bleed into 2019 so that the lower end of the 2% to 3% guide could come down again? Ken Lewis : Yes, I think that's true and I think we are trending on a lower end of that guide. Right now I think I would say to you that as we go through the cost-cutting initiatives that probably be execution cost that will be non-recurring and will be able to give you better handle on that as we go through the process next quarter. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Hi. Just a follow-up on that. I guess I thought last quarter the comments for this -- for fiscal 2019 was closer to flat and your comments about -- you guided opposite, it could be towards flat. So, just want to clarify, is your fiscal 2019 guidance a plus 2% to 3%, a change from what you had before? Ken Lewis : No, going by memory of the comments last quarter. For sure, the guidance remains the same at 2% to 3%, we gave that guidance. But I think when we talked about this quarter, because of the seasonality, I think, that's where we made reference to flat. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Ken Lewis : Sure, the guidance was up 2% to 3% and that's hasn't changed. And we're tracking to the lower end of that right now. Daniel Fannon : Got it. And then just on -- you kind of referenced increase gross sales in the quarter. We're seeing it, I guess, more in some of the U. S. products, can you talk about that momentum and kind of maybe a little more specifically where you're seeing it at some of the products and maybe some of the channels that there is actually -- you're seeing some of the traction actually pick up? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think the big driver tends to be in flows is the global bond. And if you look at the performance in just recently the one and three-year moved to the top quartile and also the fourth quarter, which as we know was a very tough quarter for every segment where MSCI was down 13 and S&P down 15. We had a positive absolute return for global bond. So, I think that gives a little bit of near-term momentum that we saw kind of -- I think as there's more uncertainty as I said before as people get a little more nervous, that tends to be a better selling product and we are certainly seeing that. And I would say that one has had the biggest turnaround in flows and we're seeing that through this current month as well. The other would be the income fund, which is something we put our press on and that's really U.S. retail product, but we saw a pickup in sales there. We're just getting that message out. We had a big anniversary kind of sales push on that fund. But those would be the two primary drivers and we saw a pickup in the muni gross numbers as well over the quarter in the U.S. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning. Just first on excess capital. What is the level of working capital, regulatory capital, and feed within the $7.8 billion just so we can back in sort of true excess here? Ken Lewis : That's approximately $3 billion. Craig Siegenthaler : $3 billion, so then it would be $4.8 billion net? Ken Lewis : Well, $3 billion to $4 billion, so $3 billion, $3 billion to $4 billion net. Craig Siegenthaler : Okay. And just as my follow-up, what is the potential for another special dividend here, and I actually think you may have another board meeting coming up in February. So what are your thoughts around that just given all that excess capital? Greg Johnson : I think as we've said before to this question that, that decision is the board decision. It's hard to handicap what they think. We feel that -- we feel and we continue to see this, we feel that having a strong balance sheet is strategic and having the dry powder for potential acquisition is always a consideration. All of that will be weighed at the February board meeting. Ken Lewis : And I just think it -- you know, I mean, this is an industry that's undergoing quite a bit of change and excess is not a word we use in the balance sheet, it's a word that the market tends to use. But we think that capital can -- if you choose appropriately, can be very strategic and add a lot of shareholder value as things change and opportunities arise and what could be a pretty volatile period for the industry. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Thanks, guys. Maybe first one for you, you mentioned in the some of the commentary just some of the traction that you're seeing over a multiple years of initiatives on the fee-based side of the business in U.S. retail. Maybe just can you give us an update on what traction you are seeing in terms of the platforms, number of products? And then maybe an update just how much of your business is on the fee-based side relative to say maybe the brokerage and how that has shifted over the past few years as these initiatives have been in place? Greg Johnson : Yeah, I mean, I think as we said before, I think, an area of significant investment for us in the last few years has been really transitioning the U.S. retail distribution to be better equipped to service of fee-based environment not only require adding a lot of different skill sets into the group, but also pricing and changing and adding classes of shares and changing products as well. And also, we created a specialized New York Stock Exchange change, dedicated, and I think those kind of changes take a little bit of time, but we are seeing results, and even the New York Stock Exchange channels, we were up 26% in sales quarter over -- the prior quarter. So I think that -- and those changes can be destructive, but I think, they\u2019re somewhat several now. I think another area that we think is going to be important, we talked about solutions. We put a big investment in solutions, and I think, today we have what we consider one of the best in the industry, which is as far as product development and where we think incremental growth can occur within our multi-asset group in solutions, we now have 11 model funds, which use underlying FTE funds, but also because they can incorporate some lower cost indexing and passive into that it gives us a much more competitive outcome-oriented solution type product, and we have 11 of those that are just rolling out right now, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest there. I think the -- I don't have the exact number between the brake, but I think, as far as we look at the world; probably 70% is going into fee-based versus brokerage today. So that's where we need to be. And what we measure is the effect of or how important it is to get products on the shelf on the platforms. And we have very specific metrics trying to do just that. And we've seen a very strong pickup and that goes to ETFs as well, where I'd say one of the big changes in the last year's, because we have been out there, long enough now with some of those ETF firms having those types of consultants in place and product managers that have been able to get approval into the New York Stock Exchange firms and that will help that as well. So, I think, it is a big transition. It's going to continue to happen with some funds that may not fit the fee-based world. Others that we have to continue to modify pricing on and maybe adjust, but I think we have better momentum or good momentum there now and hopefully that's going to continue. Michael Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Ken, just a quick follow-up on capital return. You guys have been active kind of across the different ways that you're going to return capital. Just on the buybacks, given that the pace has been elevated, any update just how we should be thinking about the rest of 2019 just in terms of the pace? Ken Lewis : Yes, it's pretty much the same policy that we've had and practice that we've had going forward. So obviously, we think stocks are good buy at this price, so we'll be active in the market. But having said that, we're going to be both systematic and opportunistic to take advantage of things like volume dips and then holdback, if we see any kind of opportunities in the M&A world there are any other need for capital. So kind of more the same. I don't know that I would think we would -- the volumes would be elevated from this level, but just we're just going to continue to be opportunistic. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks very much. Ken, staying with the margin discussion for a moment. Could you sort of maybe drill down in terms of where you think you can get some of those incremental savings versus talk to some of the incremental areas of spent? Ken Lewis : I think across the board, I think, every function is looking at their operations and trying to identify areas where we could reduce costs. It just simply looking at kind of what we do and how we do it. The worlds changed. So there's probably a lot of outdated procedures that we don't need to it, do the same way anymore. And obviously, we have been building over the years in low-cost jurisdictions, so leveraging that and that crosses every function. So, it's really an enterprise wide effort. It's hard to say one particular area versus another. But I think the key levers are the low-cost jurisdictions and then leveraging technology. And then we've kind of been very forward with what strategic investment are. So we would continue things like solutions and other strategic investments and fund them with these savings. Bill Katz : Okay, and just as a follow-up. Greg, you mentioned, it's a rapidly changing backdrop and from that I'm sort of implying that maybe a little bit more interest in M&A. Could you talk a little bit about from here, what areas seem to make the more strategic appeal to your mind? Greg Johnson : Well, I think, again, as we've said before, I think, it is a changing landscape for distribution and how we look at the world. And I think if that means there's opportunities to tie up with distribution in some cases or own portions of distribution, I think, that would be different than our traditional way of thinking about it purely independent asset manager. And I think you're seeing some of that happen in places around the globe that would be one that we think could be strategic for us. I've said, the high-yield business, the ETF business all businesses that we want. I meant \u2013 I said high-yield, the Fiduciary Trust would be one that, we would want to grow and scale up having that direct relationship with the investor. I think it would be important as well. So those just be a couple of the distribution and building high net worth would be certainly two priorities for capital. Bill Katz : Understood. And just a quick follow-up, since you have him online, I was wondering, if you can get update from the team of Benefits, just in terms of what they are seeing in terms of credit backdrop and allocations given some of the \u2013 somewhat through the fourth quarter? Rich Byrne : Sure. Greg Johnson : Rich, are you there? Rich Byrne : Yeah. Thanks. Greg. I'd be happy to take that. Fourth quarter, as you know, with the drawdown in the S&P. We saw outflows out of loan funds and bond funds. Some of that trends \u2013 that translated into the liquid markets on pricing less so in our private debt business is usually a delayed effect there. Maybe for the purpose of your question, note that almost all of our capital is locked up capital. So if your question relates to any redemption's or things like that, that's not really a factor for us. For us, it's just a function of where is the most opportunistic investment opportunity. I know, the market has retraced a lot of the declines in \u2013 from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. But we're finally starting to see \u2013 some of that lag has finally taken hold. Pricing and documents starting to reflect the more reasonable risk reward equation and just a word about sort of our philosophy. We've generally been fairly defensive in how we position most of our portfolios, particularly around the private debt product. Mostly everything, we've been doing is top of the capital structure, most of that's first lien, low loan to values. And a fair amount of dry powder. So we're looking forward to a more reasonable environment, where we can invest. Fundamentals have been still relatively strong. I know there is been some headwinds, we'll see what volatility brings us going forward, but for us, this is a buying opportunity. Bill Katz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe sticking with Benefit Street, a little bit, I guess, a couple of questions there. Number one, maybe could you give us a sense of where you are and maybe your fundraising cycles, I mean obviously, mostly lots of capital that you just kind of come out of the cycle with a lot of dry powder? Are you kind of have on the drawing board post-closing there's a fair number of new strategies or existing strategies your raising for? And then maybe, can I think when you announced the deal last quarter, you kind of suggested that beyond kind of the GAAP impacts, there could be some other things that kind of start impacting the P& L, either going forward whether it's a contingent payouts or whatnot, give any update how should we be thinking about those non-GAAP factors going forward or maybe some non-GAAP? Ken Lewis : Let me start with that, and then hand it over to Benefit Street guys. Right, so in the guidance, we talked about for this year, we have eight months left. The deal closed February 1st, that for modeling purposes, we're looking at investment management fees increasing about 3.5% and then commensurate increase in expenses, not on percentage base, but in absolute dollar basis. So we still think that in this fiscal year, the acquisition would be neutral in terms of EPS accretion and then accretive after that. Robert Lee : Okay. I mean there going to be any \u2013 so we want to think of kind of the cash impact, so we assume that\u2019s going to be somewhat higher, maybe there\u2019s some tax benefits or obviously intangible amortization things like that or? Ken Lewis : Well, those expense numbers include everything. And in terms of cost, we disclosed the purchase price, so that's it. So it's pretty upfront payment that we disclosed and then the expense number I gave you, and that's okay. Robert Lee : Okay. Right. And maybe the follow up on some of those questions. I'm sorry, go ahead. Ken Lewis : Do you want the Benefit Street folks to answer you? Robert Lee : Yes, that'd great. Ken Lewis : Okay. RichByrne: Sure. Well, let me see if I can hit the key parts that you're getting at or follow-up, if you like. We were -- most of the money as I mentioned or as you mentioned is locked up capital in drawdown funds that is our flagship funds in private debt. That's our Fund 4. We have a senior-only fund in private debt. We have a special situation fund. We're actively investing those funds. When we get to a certain threshold of drawn capital we usually then start to market our successor funds, which we intend to have successor funds in each of those. So we have been generally on pace, on all of that. And remember we also have leverage against the funds that we could use for additional buying power, if the market opportunity gets better. So we remain on pace and that sort of the nature of how we approach it. Did that answer your question? Robert Lee : Well, I was just curious I mean to say, since not familiar with your firm, you say on pace. So you kind of halfway through in investing these and to have kind of average investment period of 3 years, just trying to get a sense of when you could be hitting that next fundraising cycle? Rich Byrne : Yes. As a general rule, we raise our successor fund when we are 75% invested in the current fund. And all 3 of the funds that I referenced, and I didn't even mention you our separate accounts and other capital that we manage, that's also locked up. But we're more than 50% drawn on all the funds that I mentioned. And they all have different drawdown periods and cycle. So it's a little more detail, but we are more than halfway. We are more than half drawn and when you get to 75% you should assume we'd be launching some successor funds. Robert Lee : Okay. Great. Fair enough. And maybe if I can, just four quick question, when you think about your own budgeting and modeling going forward and given a lot of the investments you've made in, whether it's CIPs or ETFs or just new products. And obviously, you have made some and have talked about some kind of fee adjustments, how are you modeling changes in your kind of overall fee rate? I mean, do you kind of assume that it's going to go down 1 or 2 basis points a year or half? I mean, how do you kind of handle that internally? Ken Lewis : Yes. We've -- so we do the bottoms up, build of all that and then we look at the mix of assets going forward. And with the volatility this quarter, we saw a slight degradation effective fee rate. And so if you look forward for the 2019, we think that the fee rate won't change that much, it might be slightly lower than last year, but we're not getting a lot of external fee pressure on that. So we're not budgeting some material decreases in the effective fee rate going forward. Now, of course, Benefit Street will change that for the better. But if I could give you the math for that, but without Benefit Street, we don't see significant change in effective fee rate a slight degradation in 2019 versus 2018. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Greg, maybe can you talk a little bit about the investment adviser reception to the improved performance in across a lot of different products, especially in the one-year and three-year periods? And whether that's actually impacting sales here in January and also whether that's slowing redemptions? Obviously, December was heightened redemption through the industry. And then also on the institutional mandate side, any large one or lost mandates in the pipeline? And then do you see delayed fundings given the environment in the institutional space? Greg Johnson : I think December, January is always a little bit tricky to get to draw too many conclusions because of the tax selling in December and then the strength that -- the historical strength in January. After that, with some retirement fundings, other money going back in the market after tax selling, I think like most in the industry, we sometimes maybe get overly encouraged by January because it looks so good compared to December. And I think that's true again for us, and I think part of that hopefully is certainly sustainable with better performance over time and I was just looking at the chart, for us, our top 25 funds a year ago, 6% wherein above average. And this year, 78% are above other peer average. So that's a significant shift in performance that I think, we know that. We have to get that message out and then have it flow through the three-year and five-year numbers, but I think, we are encouraged by what's happening in the market. We said sometimes, being a predominantly as far as our mix having value side that it takes a little bit of a disruption in the market to get people thinking back, again, about value And I think the decoupling from the things is another important shift that's happened over last few months. That should help these. So we are seeing, as I said before, I mean, I think, the Global Bond has a very strong story in this kind of marketplace. And as people become more concerned about equity valuations and things and looking for alternatives, it's just a nice fit. So we're seeing and that one tends to move a little bit faster, and say, your traditional retail value funds, which may take a little bit more time. But clearly, I think the relative numbers give our sales force something to certainly talk about, and hopefully, we'll see that bode as I\u2019ve said, beginning January looks a lot better than December. Brian Bedell : Right. And on the institutional side? Greg Johnson : Yes, institutional, I haven't heard anything as far as -- I think we -- that may have been the case where you saw delays, but I haven't really heard that. And if you think of -- if you think the retracement in the market that we've had to-date, it would probably eliminate anybody from a timing standpoint. But I haven't -- that's just something I'm not aware of having a little delay there. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Thank you. And then just on the capital management, Ken, I think you said, just -- I just wanted to clarify, was it $3 billion to $4 billion of what you view as net excess capital or cash? And then maybe, Greg, just to expand on your M&A comments about you talked about distribution. I guess, if you can get a little deeper in that I think you mentioned the high net worth, but is there anything else where you said you wanted to own distribution? And, I guess, how that fits in with this general trend towards open architecture that's been going on for decades? A \u2013 Ken Lewis : Yes. So in our prepared remarks, for your question on the excess, let Greg get the moment, its $3.3 billion of liquid assets reserve to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital investments in our products. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Right. And so the excess capital then is you said use that word? A \u2013 Ken Lewis : No, that's what we need. So the difference is available is opportunistic and available to us. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Got it, got it, got it. Okay. A \u2013 Greg Johnson : Just to expand, I mean, I think it -- the world, if you look at -- and this is not a statement really for the U.S. When I look -- when I mentioned distribution, it's probably more outside of the U.S. and markets that have guided architecture-type platforms and may have ownership of four or five investment managers for those platforms, and it could be new technology platforms for fee-based advisers and countries where we may not have a significant share could be a good way to enter that market. So those are the kind. I think it's just a change in how we would say we\u2019re -- strictly think of ourselves as an impending pure asset manager and open architecture world. We do see more guided architecture in certain markets and the strength of banks in certain markets and bank may for regulatory reasons, spinning out there distribution and things like that, that I would say we are open to looking at that. Where in the past, we have may have said hey, we're a pure independent asset manager. That's not something we want to do and fiduciary trust is a very successful high network manager that we think could be bigger and more meaningful to our bottom line. It's something that we want to grow and something that we\u2019ve talked about. We disbelieve in the value of advice and that would be another area that would be on that list. A \u2013 Ken Lewis : But just like alternatives, real estate, all of the things are on that list too. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Great, okay, that\u2019s clear. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Q \u2013 Alex Blostein : Hey guys, just a couple of clarifications at this point. So when I look at our expense guidance again for fiscal 2019, does that include any sort of kind of severance restructuring charges that are going to be associated with the cost savings plan? And any help that kind of help us break out the actual dollar amount of kind of a run rate expenses that you expect to take out and kind of restructuring cost that will be associated with that? A \u2013 Ken Lewis : Yes, so the guidance does not include any severance or execution cost related to cost reductions, simply because we don't know about that is right now. So that's when we talk to you next quarter, we will be able to give you a better idea for that even by line item for the rest of the year. But that's going to be. We do expect all of that to be incurred in this fiscal year and not bleed in to 2020. And so, it will probably start out slowly next quarter, gradually build with the bulk of it, probably being in the fourth quarter. And then, in terms of the number, I think, of savings we're looking to get it, like we said, at or below 2018 levels without regard to Benefit Street. Alex Blostein : Got it, okay. And then just a clarification, again, another one on cash and kind of the requirements that you guys have between working capital, regulatory, et cetera. Do you include the upcoming payment to Benefit Street, which I think was $683 million within that or that would be on top? So I know you guys don't like talking about the excess cash, but would that be effectively a reduction to that number? Ken Lewis : No, that's in there. Alex Blostein : That's in there. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple left here at this point. Can you -- I know you spoke to the core trends that you expect in fee rate, but could you please quantify performance fees this quarter just so we can try to calibrate at least where we're starting off from our core fee rate basis? And then post ESP deal, it seems as though performance fees are going to be substantially larger. Is that going to lead you to actually break that out as a line item, so that we can have greater clarity and maybe avoid some of the noise that might flow into the numbers? Ken Lewis : Sure. So you're quarter-over-quarter delta for performance fees is about $4 million. And so last quarter, they were about $4 million higher than this quarter. And I think if I remember, last quarter they're about $6 million, this quarter they're about $2 million. And then going forward, yes, you're right. We do expect performance fees to be higher. We haven't made a decision on how we will present that, but for sure, we will call it out. We will call it out in the prepared remarks. In terms of the geography, the income statement, we haven't decided what to do there. Kind of waiting to see what the magnitude is, but for sure we'll call all of that out. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Greg Johnson : That\u2019s good point, some thing we're going to look at, just like we're going to look at the other income line and look at the mark-to-market effect of the investments we hold, and because that can be a little bit noisy quarter-to-quarter, too. Brennan Hawken : Sure, that's fair. Thanks. And then, just curious about -- on the accretion expectations. I know you said you don't think that there's going to be much change, and also fully appreciating that the comments about the BSP funds not really being marked as we see with some of these other alternatives. Certainly, attention being drawn to leverage lending and other similar types of lending activities, which even though explicit leverage on, it is just part of what BSP does, a lot of the other lending activities are very, very similar in structure, et cetera. So for example, the Fed SNC review, leverage lending was like three-quarters of non-accrual lending, and almost 90% of substandard commitments. And there's been a lot of significant risk flagged in these loans. I know you see the recent volatility as an opportunity. But is there still an assumption of credit losses remaining at zero in your accretion, when you think about if that turns out to be too optimistic and credit losses go up in these products, how much does that impact fundraising and how much could that impact outlook for accretion from this deal? Thanks. Ken Lewis : Well, we are assuming -- I mean, let the Benefit Street guys talk about the risks in the portfolios, but we are assuming very low -- consistent with historic results, very low default rates in our accretion analysis. Greg Johnson : And I would say, I mean, those are all fair concerns and comments and once we had well before the fourth quarter. And as we look at this business and we\u2019re late in the economic cycle and credit spreads were narrow. And I think -- we think -- again, we would say this is an asset class that's here to stay. I think that having the dry capital puts you on the right side of the trade, when other vehicles are forced to sell and have to continue to markdown. Those are the kind of things we got comfortable with. I think from fundraising, it's very hard to give you any kind of sense of what that means. I mean, yes, it's going to be harder in an environment where spreads are rising and there's defaults out there and credit issues, that's clear. But I think that our commitment is to the asset class long-term. And the fact that Benefit Street has come into that with sites wide open as far as being one of the first lien side and more senior-secured. And we know the arguments on that, that there's less junior and recovery rates going to be lower. But that's all \u2013 that\u2019s I think we feel like we are in the right place in a growing market and I'll let Rich take it from there. Rich Byrne : Thanks, Greg. I think you and Ken hit most of the key points. I guess, I would just add a few things. One, I think as the question unfolded, you talked a little bit about marks. Just to be clear, we mark all of -- and I assume, we're mostly talking about private debt here. We mark our private debt assets quarterly. Those are real marks, this is not -- there maybe a lag affect sometimes, but on a quarterly basis, we feel very comfortable that the book is marked appropriately by third-party evaluation firms. Greg mentioned, we're generally at the top of the capital structure. The correction in the markets and the drawdown in the S&P and outflows was really a technical correction, it really -- we haven't seen any material energy. There were some issues, of course with oil prices. But we haven't seen a material change in or termination in credit quality across the book. There\u2019s always going to be defaults. We have been very fortunate to be running at very low default rate historically. Of course, we are going to always model something greater than 0 in our books. But nothing that's happened in the fourth quarter has led us to materially change our assumptions around defaults or recovery rates. And we think all of our books are marked appropriately. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Chris Harris : Okay. Thanks. The earlier commentary about M&A and possibly investing in distribution, how do you guys think about the conflicts that might arise as a result of a deal like that? Greg Johnson : Well, I think that's why I said that, I don't envision this in the U.S. certainly where you'd have a conflict. But I think, the world has changed considerably where it doesn't -- in the old days, the thought of having anything direct to our consumer, you could never do if your business was sold through advisors. And today in the fee-based world where you're competing with Vanguard and conditional direct marketers, it's really just you've go to make sure, you got best of class funds with very strong track record and that's going to get you your distribution. So I don't think the conflict is big, although I would say I don't envision us doing anything in the states that would own distribution. I think it's more, we look at markets that have become more closed and guided and you look at the Canada that has a very -- has closed market as far as distribution goes, or more closed than most and Europe, which is trending that way too. We are seeing countries like Italy and others where distribution has co-owners that could be fun sponsors. So those are just the things we\u2019re looking at. And I think it's just a change in how we would view our traditional mission and mandate of being independent, one that in certain markets it may makes sense to tie up in places like Latin America where banks dominate the markets\u2026 Ken Lewis : And India. Greg Johnson : India, there\u2019s just a lot I think of places around the world, outside the U.S. where it may make sense long-term to do that. I think that's just a different thinking as far as how we would approach M&A in the past. Chris Harris : Okay, that makes perfect sense. And then just one follow-up question I had was on your investment performance. Obviously, good thing to see things trending in the right direction there. I know it might be difficult to generalize, but when you look at across your asset classes, the numbers in tax free fixed income and U.S. fixed income probably a little bit still below where guys would like to see them. What is driving that at this point? Is that kind of like a duration thing perhaps? Ken Lewis : Yeah. I think it -- so few things. I think we tend -- that's the one area where we don't worry as much about your total return ranking. I mean, we want to be in the middle because we run those funds. We want to make sure we\u2019re providing some of the highest tax fee income out there, and have a stable net asset value. It's kind of how we think about it. And that's important in how we sell those. I think as far as the makeup over the last few years and why we've underperformed would be we were on the higher end of credit quality and the lower credit in munis tended to do a bit better. Although, we saw that reverse in the fourth quarter where many of our funds had very strong performance with stronger credit compared to others and duration, we don't really switch. And we were on the lower end of duration because of predefined bonds. And again, how we think about running this as more for stability and high income and trying to make duration bets, and have a dividend that goes up and down from those duration bets. We think that's what people really want. So I don't -- we don't worry as much below or above average in that categories, we do certainly in equities. We want to make sure that the funds are stable in all types of markets and provide that high occurring income. Chris Harris : Great. Thank you. Ken Lewis : Thanks. Operator : And next questions are from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back, Greg, to your comment earlier on fees and pricing. You mentioned modifying pricing on some products. Can you just talk about your approach to that in terms of modifying pricing, your expectations there? Where have you modified? How that's played now to the expectations? And is this more about grow sales or looking to stem redemptions, how are you approaching that -- thinking about? Thank you. Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean I think it's just recognizing that being on a high-end of a fee if you're fourth quartile and fees and have top performance, you're not going to get shelf space in a -- in the new fee-based world. So, I think you have to look at how are we positioned against the universe and we have to be at least competitive on the fee side. So, we've made a series of modifications in a lot of different products. I mean they are not dramatic shifts, but we've lowered fees on our international equity funds, we have lowered fees on limited duration fixed income funds. We've changed payouts to be more competitive on -- for those that are still using the brokerage side, reallowance and things. I just think all of that affects your margin, but that's reality of where we need to be. And then I mentioned that we -- I think -- we're excited about these 11 new models that -- the outcome-oriented growth income that combine a lot of our traditional funds with some lower fee mixes and then gets you to a more competitive overall fee. And that -- we think that is very attractive in this market as well. So, I think it's just the recognition that it's not just a world where certainly the buyer or the consultant or the gatekeeper is looking just at your total return. They're looking at where you're positioned in fees. So, we have to -- and I think the good news is that we are always on the lower end of that equation. So, don't feel like we have a huge amount of changes ahead, but we continue to -- I sit there and I sit with our group and will look at every fund on a regular basis and go down and see where it's positioned. And we obviously do that with the Boards as well. But it just reflects the nature of the forces that all of us are dealing with in industry, but as Ken said, I think at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really have a material effect on our overall effective fee rate and what's going to affect that next year if emerging markets or international equities or equities are up, that's going to have a much greater effect on our effective fee rate than any tinkering by individual funds. Michael Cyprys : Got it, okay. And just as a follow-up question maybe more broadly on credit cycle and liquidity, some concerns around there around buildup and leverage by corporates with a larger portion going to daily liquidity funds, high yield bond funds, loan funds, et cetera. Can you just talk about what actions you're taking to mitigate any such risks in your daily redeemable funds? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think it is a concern and certain -- obviously, many academic papers, many journalists have covered this that liquidity in certain markets -- senior-secured debt market and floating rate and things like that, you do need to be careful about. So, I think, like most, we look at liquidity and make sure that we feel comfortable and we stress test these things and don't want to be in a position where you're force-selling into a market that doesn't have a lot of buyers. But, again, that's not an area where we have a lot of assets. So, -- and why we think benefit Street structure that is more like a private equity structure can be I think a very effective way to benefit from that dislocation in liquidity with funds on -- that are daily liquid funds. So I just don't think it's a category for us that there's a lot of assets where we would say that's a concern, I mean, we have some funds in those areas, but not \u2013 they are just not significant as far as size. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one more on M&A, maybe a longer-term view, I know, Ken, you mentioned you do want to preserve dry powder for potential future opportunities, especially if the markets get tough. So if \u2013 we are late cycle and if we do move into a bear market and recession period for a prolonged period over the next even two to three years, I mean, Greg, how do you think about large scale M&A where there would be a lot of product rationalization involved and the lost of cost-cutting. And it typically those deals are hard to execute well, and that's my manager's kind of shy away from them. But if we do have even a much tougher environment both from a market level perspective and industry-wide organic growth perspective, do you see those deals starting to form and would you be interested in engaging in something like that? Greg Johnson : Well, I think we never say never, and if we think it can add shareholder value by efficiencies and synergies and costs that's certainly something we're going to look at. But I think you hit it on the head. The execution it is very challenging. It's very disruptive and very time-consuming for management to do that. And it's also a question of the brand and how much you can throw on distribution and get those synergies. So I think it's more of the smaller media managers that will be bought versus the bigger managers that are going to combine that's where the difficulties lie and if you're not on it, smaller group that relies on a narrow distribution platform and that goes to fee-based and all of sudden you're not on that platform. Those are the ones that you will probably see moving with larger firms and you're able to benefit by getting different styles and management teams in there. I think the larger ones are very difficult, they look good on paper, but the execution side is just challenging as you said. Brian Bedell : And then maybe just going back to your alternatives comment with BSP, I guess, thinking about that, down the road as well as is there a shift into your alternatives assets in a more meaningful way, something desirable for you or rather just continue to be opportunistic around the edge of it? Greg Johnson : No, I think it is. We stated it's a priority for us to grow that business. And I think the strength and depth of the BSP senior team and access that we think really accelerates that by having somebody like Tom Gahan his senior team involved and looking at the landscape of alternatives, along with our K2 Group that \u2013 I believe will be very helpful in is looking at other opportunities in that area and none of these are vulnerable to the passive shifts in pricing wars that we're seeing on the traditional model. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Greg Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any closing comments. Greg Johnson : Well, thank you, everyone, for participating on the call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Operator : Good morning. My name is Jessie and I'll be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Johnson : Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me for his final earnings call as CFO is Ken Lewis. We also have Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, with us today. Importantly, strong investment performance translated to better flows from many of our flagship funds. Retail sales and redemptions improved significantly, particularly for global fixed income that once again attracted inflows as did Franklin income.  Earnings per share improved to $0.72, a 33% increase from last quarter. Higher investment income more than offset the initial impact of the cost structure optimization initiatives intended to increase operational efficiencies and streamline the organization.  We'd now like to open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I'm curious to see what you think what's behind the lowest redemptions since 2011. Obviously the market got better and we're coming off a crap fourth quarter. Your performance is better. There is a lot of interesting things in there. But to be lowest level since 2011, I'm curious on how much environmental versus Franklin-specific. And are you doing anything to, obviously, bring that on in the retail channel? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think partly sometimes coming off a volatile quarter, it does slow down redemption activity. We've seen that in the past. But, I think, nothing else other than better performance comes to mind. And certainly, the pickup and focus on some of the flagship funds where we've had larger redemptions and then had better performance, I'm sure has helped as well. Jennifer Johnson : And I'll just add that I think some of the investments we've made on adding talent to the distribution channels, we've seen upticks in our New York Stock Exchange channel and had some additional placements with gatekeepers and things and most recently, hires in the private wealth and the SMA channels. So I think that that's probably also helping. Glenn Schorr : And have we seen a slowing in the list consolidations that went on around the retail channel? Jennifer Johnson : You're still seeing some of that. I mean, obviously, is -- firms are rationalizing it, but we're also, in some cases, winning in those channels. Glenn Schorr : Got you. okay. And just one other follow-up, if I could on -- just curious on I know we're not there yet on Benefit Street, but what's going on behind-the-scenes to start driving growth so can hit the ground running? What's the overall plan once you're closed and out the door? Gregory Johnson : Well, I think the plan is to, first, get Benefit Street -- I mean, get our distribution comfortable with the investment process and team and then really go tackle. And that's really what they've done, I'd say, in the early months, and now we're going out with roadshows around the globe to introduce Benefit Street to our -- many of our global clients. We're also looking at expanding the retail part of the equation and developing some products there. But it's still early stage, but the focus has really been on making sure that our entire team is up to speed on Benefit Street and then attacking the clients in an optimal way. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Benjamin Herbert : And it's Ben Herbert on for Bill. I just wanted to follow-up on the expense commentary '20 versus '18. Are you still expecting the potential to be able to bend it a little bit lower than '18? Or is that maybe pushed out a bit further? Gregory Johnson : Thanks, Bill. Our guidance, we're pretty confident that we can get the run rate expenses to be at the 2018 levels. That's as a result of all the cost-savings initiatives that we're doing right now. Benjamin Herbert : And so we're not expecting to may be come in a little bit lower in '20 or just a touch? Gregory Johnson : In '20, yes. In '20 -- I'm sorry, in 2020, we expect 2020 expenses to be at the 2018 level. Benjamin Herbert : Great. But any opportunity to come in a bit lower? Gregory Johnson : Hopefully. Yes. Working on it. Benjamin Herbert : And then maybe just one unrelated follow-up would be any change in capital management priorities with the CFO change? Gregory Johnson : No. I think we all worked with the Board on the strategy around optimizing the capital management and certainly, you'll have a new input to that, but nothing at this stage to really speak about. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe, Greg, can you talk a little bit about your views on the approval of the active nontransparent ETF, whether it's something that you would look to license for your -- some of your active strategies? Maybe how that would potentially fit with your liberty shares effort right now that, I think, has been -- supposed to pass the smart beta and active? And then also whether you'd be interested in accelerating the ETF effort with any acquisitions, say, in the smart beta space? Gregory Johnson : Well, I will turn that over to Jenny, who is a Liberty Share Board Member. Jennifer Johnson : We obviously pay isn't close attention to the various blind trusts that are coming through the SEC. And with the most recent approval the Presidian, it's limited in that it's really U.S.-listed equities. So -- and you're talking about ones that can be replaced. So it's tended to be mid- and large-cap. So in that space, if we have an active product that we think that makes sense, we would certainly consider it. We have active fixed income that are performing very well, and they don't need that kind of blind trust.  And so it just depends. We're open and looking at all of them. And right now, we're seeing some good growth that we're about to just to hit $4 billion in ETFs with -- this quarter, we had one -- our FLQL, which is our liberty shares of U.S. equity ETF that is now $1.1 billion. And one of the key things with ETF is just scale, attracts more institutional players and our smart beta performed very well through this volatile market. Gregory Johnson : And I would just that, I think, as we've always said in M&A, if we see something accelerates our ETF and potentially complements the offerings and things, we're certainly still looking at that as well. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. And then maybe just on that M&A theme. Obviously, the Invesco-Oppenheimer deal is about to close and fairly sizable one. If that is -- ends up being successful in terms of -- sort of rekindling organic growth and obviously getting the cost saves. Do you think that would potential spur more industry consolidation for these types of properties? And would that lead you to think potentially it might make sense for you to even consolidate more on a sort of on a sort of a scale basis? And maybe just any updated thoughts on, I think, you had mentioned the distribution agreements potentially in Europe in some past calls. Any updated thoughts on that? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think we just pointed that it's not -- it's a challenge to combine entities of that size. But certainly, there is a huge opportunity for cost savings and synergies there. And I don't think we have that strong opinion one way or another other than if we have the right fit and right culture and right complement, we would certainly take that on. I just pointed to how disruptive it can be and difficult. But certainly, there is opportunity if executed well on that. That's something that every firm, I think, has to be open to when looking at margins and other ways to reduce expenses in a challenged revenue environment.  The other -- I don't think there is much new to report, and Jenny can add maybe, but on looking at distribution plays and M&A., I think that's certainly something that, as we have said on past calls, that we're more open to doing in certain markets and it will continue to look, but there is nothing new really new to say there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : First on some of the efficiency initiatives. Can you just provide -- I need a little detail on where you're pursuing those? You mentioned outsourcing, but any other areas? And then in terms of redirecting those savings, you guys have talked about either the multi-asset solutions, distribution, but just specifically, over the next two years, as you're getting those efficiencies, what are some of those priorities? Gregory Johnson : Okay. I'll start with the cost savings. It is a enterprise-wide effort. So essentially, all the business units participated in it. So it's difficult. And I will point out that the outsourcing announcement is just in the early stages. So there's going to be more to come on that in 20 -- in the year 2020. But the cost-savings initiatives that we're referring to in the text and on this call relate to just the -- all the -- every department in the company looking at their operations and finding ways to become more efficient. Maybe it's a leverage or low cost jurisdictions and maybe just to eliminate processes that we're not doing it. So it's enterprise-wide. And you want? What we're going to invest the money on? Jennifer Johnson : Sure. Yes. No, obviously, multi-asset solutions and distribution are two big areas. And in that, in distribution, it's both in people. So we've added key talent in important areas as well as technology, technologies that support the distribution channels whether we're partnering or developing some capabilities on our own. And then, of course, data science. Data science that supports our distribution so that we could be smarter at providing the right products through the distribution channels and, of course, on the investment management side.  We believe that active managers need to be -- need to have the ability to leverage AI and machine learning and data science to gain insights. And that's really nascent, but it's important. We think it's very important over the long run. And so developing capabilities around that is critical. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just to sort of follow up on the flows. You guys had some good pockets of improvement. Greg, you mentioned the global bond and in international retail. So on the institutional side, it seems that continues to be a bit of a headwind. I think you mentioned during the quarter some items that impacted you, but just maybe little color there and then just on the outlook what you're seeing in that channel. Gregory Johnson : Yes, I think -- I think, you're correct in saying that there's -- that's where we had some headwinds continuing. And I think the majority of our assets historically have been on the Templeton side and institutional and another -- as the markets have rebounded, they value trailed growth by about 400 basis points over the quarter, so that hasn't helped the relative numbers there.  And as we enter our 10th, 11th year of this cycle, it's just -- you still have pressure on redemptions and certainly not new sales to support that. So that's where we saw some global equity accounts go as well as some variable annuity, that's been a continued headwind. We probably have another $1 billion next quarter coming and that'd be a business that some of it's going passive, a lot of it's just they've gotten out of the business and are looking whether it's low vol or other type of fund managers or indexing. We've seen a lot of that. And that represented a large number of the redemptions as well for the past quarter.  So those are the two that continue, I think, to put pressure on the net numbers. And overall, retail would have been just about breakeven or positive if it wasn't for the institutional side where we see some of the larger redemptions. The good news is they're in lower cost fund -- separate accounts or funds. Operator : Our next question is a from the line of Ken Worthington of JP Morgan. William Cuddy : This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken. First, Ken, thank you for perspective -- your perspective over the years. Turning to questions. Franklin has been investing in it's RIA and adviser distribution. Could you please update us on your progress on those investments? And within retail, how much of the retail flows are coming from RIAs and advisory? Are we beginning to see your investments in those channels pay off? Jennifer Johnson : We are beginning to see it pay off. We actually had a good uptick this quarter, but it is still a much smaller part of our U.S. retail distribution and one that we're very focused on growing. And there's a lot of different ways to be able to attack that market. We have a multi-asset solutions has launched for models that we think will be appealing to that market. We also have come up with sleeves that can be incorporated into more of open-architecture models. We look at strategic investments in tools that RIAs use because they tend to be more independent in some of the technology that they use.  And so whether we do strategic investments or whether we support those applications through our own models and content. So all of those things are focused for us on the RIA channel. Obviously, the ETFs. We're getting some good traction on the ETF space in the RIA channel. They tend to like ETFs but we definitely see it as a very important strategic focus going forward. William Cuddy : Great. Turning to tax prefixed income. There has been a commentary on impacted of tax reform on the MENA market. Have you seen changes in broker sales? Either in the tax reform broadly. And more recently, we're coming off of tax season. Have you seen a change in behavior as a result of tax season and some of the speculation about lower refunds this year for the tax rate and fixed income bonds? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I just would say in general, I mean, it was a stronger quarter for tax-free flows and for us, a positive inflow, which it hasn't been in a while. So that was good. I think the -- everybody becomes more aware of taxes and especially in those states that no longer have the state deduction, the tax -- the double tax rate is very attractive and our Cal tax-free has done pretty well in performance on top of that. So I think it's an area that clearly had improved gross sales and flows and hopefully, that will continue as people have to pay up more their estimated taxes and things to make up the difference of not having that the state deduction. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : On the expense guidance, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it right. So you kept the guide -- the 2020 guide basically flat with 2018, excluding Benefit Street. So is the 15% to 16% 2019 comp guidance excluding Benefit Street as well? And through that lens, that was -- pardon me? Yes? Gregory Johnson : I'm sorry. I didn't hear the sentence. I cut you off there. Patrick Davitt : Go ahead. Gregory Johnson : It includes Benefit Street. This year includes Benefit Street, but... Patrick Davitt : Right. I guess it still would suggest the vast majority -- sorry? Okay. There's -- Do the -- It just the vast majority of that guidance basically severance. Could you kind of separate out how much it would be up without kind of onetime or severance-type item? Gregory Johnson : You're right, it is severance. I think we can give you perhaps a range for what we think the execution cost for all this cost savings are. We think it's about 2% increase. 2% of the increase is related to the execution costs, other cost initiatives. Patrick Davitt : Including severance? Gregory Johnson : Yes. Patrick Davitt : Okay. cool. On Benefit Street again. Was -- were they -- did they add to the $60 million performance fee at all? And do you have any updates on your views of timing of potential accretion from the deal? Gregory Johnson : I do. Performance fees were minimal in total and inclusive of Benefit Street this quarter. And I think we are still pretty confident in our projections that this year it was -- as we said, it's going to be neutral. Next year slightly accretive and then as a result, the revenue growth accretive after that. Patrick Davitt : Great. And any update on the potential noncash expense that's in numbers from that deal? Gregory Johnson : Yes. The cash -- you could see the cash went down this quarter, though it's pretty much related to Benefit Street and a couple of other things. But... Patrick Davitt : No. I meant like noncash... Gregory Johnson : We just closed the purchase price and other cash price of that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : And Ken, best of luck in your next chapter. Kenneth Lewis : Thanks. Robert Lee : Could you maybe just go back to Patrick's -- your answer to Patrick's question on the 2% increase. Did you mean 2% increase in total expense, excluding sales spend? Kenneth Lewis : Yes. I'll simplify that even more. Our estimate is like between $50 million -- for the remainder of this fiscal year between $50 million and $60 million of execution costs. Robert Lee : Great. And then obviously that includes severance and whatnot? Gregory Johnson : That's right. Exactly. That's right. Robert Lee : Right. okay. Perfect. Maybe shifting gears. I'm just kind of curious are you've seeing the rebound in demand for global fixed and, in particular, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. I'm just kind of curious outside the U.S. that where you're seeing some of the best traction. I know in years past, it was Italy, for example, is a big market for you. Are using it -- is it relatively concentrated in a couple of places? Are you seeing spread out? Just trying to good to get some color on that. Gregory Johnson : Yes. I just -- I actually just returned from Asia yesterday and spent nine days traveling around. And we're actually seeing most of the growth in -- or rebound in sales coming from Asia. And if you look at Hong Kong, Singapore, in particular, Europe secondarily. But as we said before, a lot of these type of retail sales are driven from the home office and the platform and putting it back on. And we're really seeing a renewed interest in the global bond fund.  And I think part of that is just the fear of retail investors right now having gone through December. And even with the rebound, there's just a lot of caution out there. And this fund had a positive return in December, which, I think, just highlighted how it can lower the overall risk in a portfolio and people looking for alternatives that are not as beta- and duration-related. So we just had a strong renewed interest there and very optimistic that, that will continue as markets reach new highs as well. So it's really been more Asia, then Europe and then the U.S. Robert Lee : Okay. And then maybe going back - it's like the one last question. Going back to capital management from earlier, and I apologize if you had addressed those, but share repurchases, you had the lowest levels. It's been that in a while understanding it did Benefit Street this quarter. But with the cash investment levels having come down as you've used it and returned it. I don't know to what extent the change in CFO and clearly someone who has background and M&A. Is that at all kind of impacting how you think about the level of excess cash you want -- you're willing -- you prefer to keep on hand versus what you may have done otherwise? I mean, just trying to see if that maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I'm just to trying to get your take on that? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I don't think, as I said before, that the change in the CFO has a whole lot to do with the buybacks. I think you had a very choppy December period in redemptions and you had the acquisition. And we've been pretty aggressive in buying back and we -- if you're opportunistic, you really don't want to set the given level at any time. And also there was much lower volume in the stock through that period. So we don't Like to be the market in the stock as well and just back up a little bit. But I don't think it should indicate any think going forward other than we're going to continue to be opportunistic and use the cash and then have, as we said before, we think the balance sheet provides us with a lot of options. And we're going to continue to look at, whether it's alternatives or other things that we think can add shareholder value over time. Kenneth Lewis : And there are market issues too. Like, for example, this quarter, our 10(b)-18 volume dropped more than 40% versus last quarter. So there's -- those execution issues as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : A question around -- another one around expenses. So I guess, in the regional marks, you guys highlighted the decision to outsource a portion of the fund admin business. Can you walk us through what percentage of AUM and then what products will be outsourced? Who are you guys outsourcing to? And whether or not there's going to be an opportunity to outsource more over time? Gregory Johnson : I don't -- we're not looking at the -- we don't look at the outsourcing decision on a product basis. It's more of a process basis. And so I think, specifically, we're talking about aspects of the fund accounting, fund reporting process. The decision to outsource, we feel, brings it more in line with our peers. And it's part of a broader effort to kind of advance our capabilities. And I think one of the things that's changed for the providers is that, they've reached a scale where they can meet our global and unique needs on a cost efficient basis and that wasn't the case before. I guess that's it. Kenneth Lewis : And it would cover most of our funds, I would guess. Gregory Johnson : Yes, it covers -- yes. exactly. It's not products specific. It's across the all the funds processed. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Okay. And I guess when you guys look out beyond 2020, and that guidance is fairly clear. But, I guess, once you get through these cost-cutting initiatives and it sounds like you have the program, but the cost initiatives might end up being ongoing over time. How should we think about the organic kind of net expense growth for the business taking account kind of the initiatives you guys have in place both on the cost side and the growth side? Kenneth Lewis : One thing I think it's important to point out is we will continue to -- while we continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that Jenny mentioned, there was some frontloading of that last year. Some investments we made last year. And so you did see an increase in expenses there and that were kind of if you were backfilling or kind of globalizing the expense base as the rails of that. So we'll continue to make those investments. I think that this process that we're going through makes us more efficient and more scalable. So normally, we might have seen a certain growth rate as the business grows. I think certain growth rate of expenses as the business grows. I don't think we'll see that in the future because of our -- we're increasing our scale. So I think inflation is a good guideline to think about expense growth, but we will try to keep it under that. Operator : We do have a follow-up question from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : You mentioned $1 billion coming out from the VA. Could you scale that relative to what you saw last quarter and remind us how much is left in that bucket? Gregory Johnson : It's probably similar to this quarter where we -- I can -- I had about $1.1 billion as well go out this quarter and just in -- we've identified another $1 billion next quarter. And I don't have the assets that -- we'll get back on that. But there's nothing, I think, any of the older assets you could put at risk just because that they are at change, but nothing beyond that $1 billion as far as visibility for the quarter -- the next quarter that we are aware of. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jeffries. James Steele : This is actually James Steele filling in for Dan. Sorry. Just one more on the outsourcing of the funds administration. Is this going to entail any sort of a different ongoing fund admin cost just sort of outside of the onetime cost associated with it? Jennifer Johnson : I'll just ask -- answer a couple of things. I think that, no, you wouldn't see a dramatic reduction, but there will be some reductions to the fund's expenses. So there is some savings to the individual funds. And if anything, it's as much as a risk. And as Ken mentioned, just historically, one of the reasons that we had it in-house is that the providers just didn't have the global footprint that we had to be able to do it. Now they can and they have a scale that can meet our cost level. And for us, it's also as much a risk mitigation as they are able to continue to invest in the technology. James Steele : Okay. And is there -- if you -- could you size the difference in the all-in fund expense? Jennifer Johnson : I mean, it's... Gregory Johnson : Yes, let me just say that this is -- there'll be more to come on this next year. It's kind of -- it is a pretty early announcement on this. And so even the execution of it will take us -- the beginning of the execution will take us into 2020. And so it's really a 10-year cost benefit analysis on that. So there'll be more to come on that in the future. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Johnson for any additional concluding comments. Gregory Johnson : Well, thank you very much, everyone, for attending and I want to thank Ken Lewis for his tremendous service to our organization over his career. He will still be with us through the transition here, but I just want to thank him on behalf of all of us. Kenneth Lewis : Thanks. Thanks, Greg. Just a few words. Yes, so it's been over 30 years and over 50 earnings calls here. As Greg said, I'll stay in advisory capacity until September 30. The March has felt like -- the 30-year March has felt like a good times to try to make a change and including a little R&R before the next opportunity. There's no shortage of opportunities in the Bay Area, as I'm sure you can guess. But I do want to say I feel very confident leave you in good hands. I know the Executive team here and we will be successful. One of the reason that I worked for so long is the company's deep culture of honest -- honesty and integrity.  I know they'll -- those values will serve them. And I want to thank all of you for your thoughtful and thought-provoking questions over the past 13 years. I'm sure I'll miss that quarterly challenge. So I hope we all pass across in the future. So thanks a lot everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Gregory Johnson : Hello, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We are please to report overall investment performance, sustained recent momentum, despite some market volatility during the quarter. Sales improved again as a result with encouraging trends in both the wirehouse [ph] and institutional channels. We remain very focused on managing our expenses while simultaneously making the necessary investments in the business to deliver strong performance. This month, we announced several senior-level additions and organizational changes to certain investment teams designed to enhance our portfolio management, research, and data analytics capabilities. With me today is our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jenny Johnson, and joining us for his first earnings call is Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. Matthew has been with us for three months now and is already very immersed in our business. We're glad to have him with us. I'd now like to open the line up for your questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is now live. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. And this might be a little complex, but sales were basically 50-50 split between inside and outside the U.S. while the AUM is more like two-thirds-one-third. I'm just curious if you could talk about what's driving the more balanced mix in sales and what are the free rate implications going forward. And maybe you could do that assuming kind of a flat flow environment. Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean I would -- first, I think there was a lot of institutional movement kind of moving around so much where I would draw a conclusion that that number percentage of sales is here to stay. We'd have to kind of take a look at that. And I think the -- from just a general statement some of the pressures that you're seeing in the U.S. and certainly from retail side and the move to passive and things, on the retail channel you're not really seeing that as much globally. So I think that that -- you don't have that pressure like you do. So I would think that some of those numbers should increase. And probably just overall, the global side relies more on global bond sales, and that continues to do pretty well, especially over the last few quarters in the retail channel outside of the U.S. Jennifer Johnson : And I'd just add we have had some success selling some fixed maturity plans, both in Asia and in Europe. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And that's in the one but yet -- not yet funded pipeline, I take it? Gregory Johnson : No, that one funded during the quarter. I think the total was -- that was a $500 million one during that quarter that funded. Glenn Schorr : And then maybe just one on Benefit Street, just talk about how performance is going, and then more importantly, what you're doing to leverage both their capabilities and to distribute more of their products across your broader platform? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean I think we're very pleased with how it's going. As you know, it's a different kind of sales cycle, then more like private equity and building it into the retail channel, we're making great progress, but to get -- those are going to be new products, whether they're interval funds for the retail market, we're working with wealth management platforms to leverage the BDC as well as the public REIT and having success there. So we're optimistic about that. And I think in the last five months we had over 375 meetings globally, and feel like we're getting very strong reception in both the institutional and retail channel. Nothing to report as far as the very stable business right now in terms of AUM and profitability, and we're still very optimistic looking at the pipeline going forward on growth. And I'll ask if Matthew or Jenny wants to add anything on BSP. Jennifer Johnson : We funded $125 million CLO in the quarter, and I'd just -- I would say just to add to Greg's comments on the interest globally, both on the institutional and the retail side. There's strong interest, and it does take a little bit longer on sale, but we've been very pleased with the response in the market. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thank you. Gregory Johnson : And the first -- I think their first -- the next large fund is targeted to close in the second-half of 2019 senior opportunities fund. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gregory Johnson : Morning. Craig Siegenthaler : Of the $5 billion in discretionary cash and investments what level of this would you feel comfortable deploying into an acquisition before considering any debt raise? Matthew Nicholls : Good morning. I think the answer to that is that we are flexible in terms of how much cash we'll use for an acquisition, but I would cautionary way to make the point that we're going to remain conservative in terms of our balance sheet. The structure and consideration of any transaction would always result in a conservative pro forma outcome, which means that the probability of us using all of that cash for a single transaction or a series of transactions is quite low. And for any larger transaction we're most likely to use a combination of cash and stock. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Matt. And just as a follow-up on M&A here. I saw the commentary on wealth managers. So I'm thinking what type of D2C businesses are you targeting for a potential acquisition? Jennifer Johnson : So one is we think we have, obviously, Fiduciary Trust, and we think that that's a great business and benefit from scales. So we'd be looking for strategic acquisitions in markets where we don't have a big presence, so that would be one. We think there's some interesting kind of fintech type of acquisitions that can enhance the high-net-worth business, and when you're dealing with a high-net-worth you have multi-generation. So the younger generation is often more interested in more self-service in technology and so buying some startups that have that capability is interesting to us. Matthew Nicholls : And Fiduciary Trust is a great business, and we have a good foundation to build upon. I think all know that the activity around wealth management across private equity investing in particular is very significant. And the amount of different integration and roll-up transactions into wealth managers is very pronounced in the marketplace. And frankly, that activity is being concentrated in private equity, and there isn't any reason why strategic with no net wealth managers could not be more active in that transaction flow. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Maybe first on the global equity business, it's been about four-and-a-half years since your last quarterly inflows into that asset class. Since then you've seen about $1 billion redemption on a business that's just $170 billion in size. So if you can solve the problem here, it would seem as though there's a lot of upside. Maybe where do you see the biggest issues in the global equity franchise today, sort of leading to or contributing to those outflows? And then, as you think about the next two to three years, maybe what are the steps you're considering that could stop or slow the asset losses. And with Matthew joining the team, might there be something more strategic on the M&A side that might help turn the tide here? Gregory Johnson : Yes. No, I think you're absolutely right. And even if you look at this quarter and just say, all right, look at the overall flows, and that -- that without that category you'd probably be in positive flows. So for us it's really the deep value style of a Templeton, of a mutual series that we've all talked about it just about on every call. But we have another quarter where you have 200 to 300 basis points in differential and performance between your MSCI value and growth indices, and that trend has continued. So Templeton has stuck to its knitting and is a deep core value manager, and until that reverses it's just -- it's very difficult to get a lot of attention back. And then you have the pressure in the retail channels, which is the active and passive. I think the more successful managers through this cycle have had the flexibility of core mandates. That's what our solutions group allows us to do is build that. We have a very successful global growth manager. It's one of our fastest growing funds. But it's $1.3 billion today and with inflows, and just getting on platforms with long-term -- with its record getting past five-10 years now. So that doesn't make up when you have a franchise as powerful as Templeton on the other side, but any deep value manager it's been very difficult. So I think that that needs to change. We continue to make changes within that organization, and Jenny will speak to some of that in a minute. But for us it's really, when you say the future, and how do you -- I think the flexibility active manager is important and not to be bound by a strict discipline or at to have an offering out there and we can do that. We have all of those capabilities of very successful global growth managing and very successful value. And we have the solutions capability to build core assets and that's what we are doing with some of the sleeves within our SMA accounts and things. But Jenny can speak to maybe just specifically with Templeton some of the changes that we have\u2026 Jennifer Johnson : Yes, so we acquired Edinburgh Partners and brought back Dr. Sandy Nairn who as you may recall was John Templeton's Director of Research. And he has been working and he is the chairman of the global equity group. And he has been working with the team there very closely. And we just announced two big hires there; Alan Bartlett coming in when Norm Boersma retires at the end of the year as the CIO. Alan is probably a little bit better known in Europe. But Sandy and Alan have had a long relationship and very excited to bring him in. And then key hires Peter Sartori in Asia. And this is one of the things were when value underperforms and we've obviously been through this cycle a few times. But you look at it and while there is outflow, the reality is take the Templeton growth fund it's got average PE of about 13.5 versus say the SMP at 21. People who are building a full portfolio want to make sure that they hedge the risk. And so we still think that this is a great franchise. And when things shift back to value, people would be rewarded with this. But in the meantime, we continue to invest in a business and give great focus and make sure we have good talent there. Gregory Johnson : And I would also add just when you look at Templeton, we did make some changes with the emerging markets group and successions with Mark Mobius and that team and more flexibility in I would say in style where the IT has become a bigger portion of the emerging markets indices. And we felt we need flexibility there. We have managed through that change. And the performance is excellent for that group. And also the quality as far process and we think it's a real opportunity on the institutional side for the first time with many changes in that group. So, I think we are examining it. But I think with Templeton's large institutional base, it's very hard just to suddenly say it's going to be more flexible in how we become more growth year to RP [ph], but I think the flexibility to figure out new ways to figure out how to be more efficient in the value space is something we are very committed to. Matthew Nicholls : With respect to your question on M&A not withstanding all the great internal organic growth we have going as referenced by Jenny and Greg, we have a very proactive approach I would say to M&A in both asset management and wealth management. We are specifically not shy of large scale transactions to create growth and promote diversification of our business, but frankly only a small handful of those really make much sense. Amongst other things, we are very focused on certain international locations where we are subscale and we can win growth and make sense because of the demographics of those countries. We think expanding and globalizing, I would turn to asset business and build upon our acquisition of Benefit Street makes tremendous sense. We believe accelerating scale in certain investment objectives make sense. Institutionally is very important to us. A big focus on strategic activity,and then as we mentioned a second ago, expanding our wealth business on the fiduciary trust. Ken Worthington : Okay, thank you. And maybe just following up on insurance, you had outflows in the quarter in the DA business, any -- does this foreshadow anything over the next 12 months? I remember last time we had outflows for a number of quarters. And then just to play good cop as well, you highlighted the opportunity on the asset allocation side for the insurance channel. Could you flesh out your comments there a little bit more? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean any of the traditional assets that are still in the mutual fund you put under a watch list. I don't there is anything from a significant flow standpoint occurring next quarter. But, all of those assets continue to be under pressure and whether it's transitioning to passive or lower volatility or asset allocation models, we continue to do that. I think we have had plenty of interest on these new models and new allocation within insurance companies, and we continue to see that growth. There is nothing to report as far as new wins this quarter, but hopefully, as we have said before that we can replace a lot of that, suppose older mandates and be competitive in the new lowball and asset allocation area. And that's what we, build teams to do. And I would just say generally, that from a pipeline and flow and this is always a hard one for us to kind of forecast for you as what we think next quarter. I think we've seen some significant wins. But we also know that we have a few big mandates and they're all, in the very lower fee ones, moving out one, a couple of big ones in Canada that were Canadian equity and Canadian fix specifically, but relatively low fee, but we had a big win in the K2 side. So we kind of look at and say that we have 4 billion in and 4 billion out between just those wins and losses. And some of that will come out next quarter so we will come in next quarter. But it's kind of as best we can look at the pipeline in somewhat of a wash right now. And I give I think, we can't give much color beyond that. We don't know, specifically when the funding dates are for some of those mandates. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Gregory Johnson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, Matt, also with you another, you've been in the position for three months, because you may be frame a bit more what you see as the key priorities and opportunities over the next year or two for you. And within that theme, any potential changes and how you think about parameters around looking at the evaluation of potential M&A targets? Matthew Nicholls : So my priorities have been to get up to speed as quickly as possible on the finance group. First of all, that's a big group here doing lots of different things across 35 countries. So the first thing I've done is that. Second thing is to form a more centralized corporate development function and focus more on corporate strategy on the centralized level across all the different groups that we have in the firm been working on that. Third is to really select where we want to focus our time on strategy. There's lots of things we can do across wealth and asset management, and in different geographies, different asset classes, as I've referenced. So focusing on a few of those where we think is going to make the biggest difference to our firm, expeditiously without panic is been very important to me and what I've been focused on with both management team and executive committee here. So that's been my primary focus. And then, obviously, to focus on the capital structure making sure we retain the financial flexibility that we have today that we talk a fair amount in our prepared remarks about and that's not going to change as I referenced in the beginning. But our ability or willingness, if you will, to deploy some of that cash is certainly the top of our mind strategically. So that's the -- my main parts to begin with. Patrick Davitt : Okay. Thanks. And then, the expense guidance, including BSP year-over-year and 2019, is that on the fall of 2018 number including all one timers and through that lens, any updated thoughts on moving to non-gap reporting and when you could make that kind of change and what you think the size of the potential adjustments could be if you do make that change? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, so fiscal 2019, including BSP and non-recurring items net of S&D is about plus 11% to 12% from fiscal 2018 and no adjustments to 2018 on that. So that's correct. What's your second question? Patrick Davitt : Thoughts about moving to a non-gap reporting where a lot of these one-timers would be adjusted out of your reported earnings number. And to the extent you do make such an adjustment? What you think the scale of the change would be to a 2020 type number? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think at the moment, the way we see is the gap reporting is the cleanest way to report our financials. We do obviously have adjustments that we try and highlight in our prepared remarks. But until we take one step further in complexity, we intend to keep it as it is and just make sure we have as helpful prepared remarks as possible. And we have our Chief Accounting Officer Gwen with us also at the table who is staring at me from the right [indiscernible]. So yes, we are sticky with GAAP finance. So we do something more complex. Patrick Davitt : Fair enough. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. I guess just to follow-up on that question on just to clarify here for the fiscal 2020 expenses, inclusive of BSP that's on a fully loaded 19 number or it's going to be flat? Gregory Johnson : Correct, yes. Daniel Fannon : Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of the commentary at the beginning in the prepared remarks around kind of some of the changes you've made, obviously you talked a bit about the global equity with there also changes on the fixed income side so curious if you anticipate any changes or I should see any push back from consultants are intermediaries around some of these changes are just kind of flush out a little more detail kind of what you guys have done so because I'm sure you know internally is probably much bigger deal, but externally it's a little hard to see what you guys actually are doing in terms of some of these changes. Jennifer Johnson : I mean I say one thing is as a firm that has long tenured investment people, people do come to the end of the career and choose to retire and I think none of these have been a surprise around that. Having said that bringing in Sandy Naren on the Templeton Global Equity Group and having sort of to say as a new CIO, they're going to put their own stamp on the investment process and so the feedback, it always takes a while and people puts you on kind of a wait and see as the process the changes. We had good feedback and that we were very proactive in reaching out I think over 200 institutional clients on the Templeton team to explain the changes. On the fixed income, creating this quantitative Insights Group actually we've had it somewhat internally, but what Dr. Selma [ph] decided when she came in is recognizing that there was opportunity to leverage the Group more broadly across the very fixed income teams in addition to that, while we had acquired Random Forest and we're incorporating data science in some of our fixed-income groups, there is obviously opportunity to continue to do that. And so, by having Roger based just focused on data science and really kind of new Fintech investment opportunities as well as the quantitative strategies, it really highlights and make sure that as a firm, we have the focus on that. So we really view it as strong evolution in the investment process, I don't think anybody could sit that out there and think that they're going to not evolve with the way information is now available in technology and data evolve their investment process to incorporate this until we really see it as a natural evolution, but in a time where things are evolving quickly. So far it's been well received, but it always takes time -- little time for these things to settle. Gregory Johnson : And I think it's your question reminds me that old Mark Twain [ph] line of a mall for progress it's change, I don't like. And I think we recognize that these are some take it in a very positive way, some are a little more cautious. And at the end of the day it could cost you short term, some business, but we think it's the right, these are the right moves to put us on the strongest footing going forward and that's I think the way we have to look at the business. Daniel Fannon : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is now live. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been asked already. Just on staying on flows for a moment, appreciate the ins and outs on the institutional side just sort of wondering if you could speak to what you've seen in the month for retail made by asset class or by geography. Jennifer Johnson : So on the retail side, on that from an asset class, I mean the areas that we're seeing positive flows are tax free, fixed income, the global and international fixed income. The positive on sort of the Franklin equity side, we've made some big investments in personnel on the U.S. retail side to have a focus on, we talked about the New York Stock Exchange channel and in last quarter I think we had a 26% uptick in sales there and we're continuing to see progress there. We're seeing progress and traction on the SMA business. We've had some good wins on the collective investment trusts in the -- it with our partnership with Wilmington Trust. So areas that we have focused on you know with some hires and new personnel, we're seeing some really good traction, it's still early in that process, but we're seeing good traction there and then of course our Dynetek fund, which I think is in the top decile 1, 3, 5 and 10 year is having -- it had its greatest quarter yet as far as net flows\u2026 Gregory Johnson : Was that the question, Bill? I mean were you talking about this closed July or I couldn't quite\u2026 Bill Katz : I appreciate the strategic answer but I was hoping to gather more of a tactical update about how July was looking maybe on a net basis. Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean I don't I think it's the market have been relatively stable through that, so the trends that you're seeing are continuing with uncertainty on the retail side with tax, I think is the one that's emerging and has gone from $2 billion in outflows, a few quarters ago to close to a $1 billion in inflows this quarter. So that's a pretty big reversal and then U.S. equities continue to be strong as well as multi-asset balance. But nothing and I wouldn't call out anything I think global bonds has had a little bit of a short term underperformance, so that may affect things in the short run as a perception of rates and the Fed cutting rates versus our position generally which has been more position for a rising rate environment. But with that said I think that fund has done very well with its other big bets, so it's not a big drag on the fund. But nothing I think I wouldn't really call it any big changes in terms of just the retail fund flows. Bill Katz : Okay, that's helpful and thanks for the combined answer. And just as a follow-up let's come back to fiscal 2020 expenses for a moment, I guess as I look at the last couple of conference calls and sort of reread some of the transcript in the dialog about the Q&A. It does seem to be a little bit of a difference of how you sort of think about fiscal 2020 today versus maybe where we were three months ago. So is it really now a sort of a flat to slightly lower as you had tried to ring fence that and within that the annualized savings that you highlighted in your prepared remarks earlier. Is that what's the timeline to sort of getting to those savings? Matthew Nicholls : Hey. Hi, Bill, it's Matthew. I think a couple of things there. First of all our guidance has changed a little bit in the sense of bringing it down a fraction. I don't want to overstate that it really is a fraction. So I think beforehand we were talking about it being marginally higher now we're marginally lower. So that's the first point. That includes by the way and this triangulates back to some of the questions on capital management, it does include some meaningful investments that we continue to make organically around multi-asset business data, science technology and so on that that Jenny referred to. So while we are very disciplined around our expenses, we're also making sure that doesn't compromise the growth strategy that we have internally around our capital. So that's the 2020 answer. Did you have another question on 2020? Bill Katz : No, that's helpful and having met all the tax guides you gave for the fourth quarter. Is that a fair look forward into fiscal 2020 or is it an opportunity to bring that down even more? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think actually there was I read all of the initial preliminary reports this morning and I think there was a bit of confusion around the tax rate, so I just want to clarify what we meant and what's in the prepared remarks. So inclusive that the revision that we talked about in this quarter, we estimate that our fourth quarter tax rate will be between 22% to 22.5%. That means the full-year 2019 tax rate would be between 26.5% and 27%, the 21% to 22% that we referred to is referencing 2020 onwards. Bill Katz : That's great. Thank you very much. That's perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you, our next question is coming from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the expenses the amount you mentioned on the guidance for 2020, I guess just maybe longer term and bigger picture, how are you thinking about your margins in the business over time just given the focus on efficiencies yet some of the investments that you're making in some of the flow trends that you guys are facing currently? Matthew Nicholls : Look we're obviously as a business focused on running our margins to go back up. I'm not going to give any guidance on that. I mean we have reported that if you exclude the non-recurring items that our margin is closer to 29% or just above 29%, we'd obviously like for it to be higher than that. But we can't let that impact what our long-term strategy as a company and the investments that we need to make to achieve some of the things that Jenny and Greg talked about. We're very focused on investing for the future while being incredibly disciplined around expenses. We already have a new budget process that we're putting in place right now. We've been working through that and that is all about making sure that we stay on top of our expenses. But at the same time making sure we have enough investment dollars to recirculate into the business as I described a moment ago and that's why we're fairly comfortable with the guidance we're giving on 2020. Well I should say it is early days. Michael Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the flow side, I think you guys flagged few known institutional platform redemptions in July. Greg I think you mentioned maybe in that $4 billion range. And then on the growth side you guys mentioned the $2 billion pipeline and then some traction on the solutions maybe just provide an update and some additional color on where you're seeing like increased demand. You've given whether it's the performance that you're seeing in some of the products seeing improvement or some of the investments that you have made over the past few years and where you're starting to see more progress or traction there? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean I think Jenny mentioned we made a pretty significant investment just to restructure some of the U.S. retail and New York Stock Exchange focused generalization and more specialization and we saw pretty good pickup year-to-date there of about 24% I think or something. In sales I think if you look at just market share despite flow numbers I think in the last quarter something like four out of six or four out of five of our major categories, we picked up market share and I think that's a result of a lot of different things that we've been doing that we've been talking about, I think over the last year that we've seen some additional investment there. I think where scale comes to play for a business, our size is really the business than being in the solutions business in a real way and then taking all these capabilities into separately managed accounts or asset allocation and that that's a big push right now that we think there's only a few people that can do that and we think that's going to continue to be a very strong growth area for the business outside of the traditional fund side but I'll ask Jenny if she wants to add anything. Jennifer Johnson : No, I think that's right, and I think the model portfolios we've had some wins on model portfolios and one of our advantages is that we allow open architecture models, so we have some internally and sleeves that are internal with some portion external and so having that real solutions business both with the breadth of capability that we have as a firm as well as due diligence team that can evaluate outside managers, I think has been given us that advantage in that area. And I think that the SMA business is an opportunity for us. It was just in the last four months that we got approval from our board to do some kind of completion type funds that we think can take a strategy like the income fund strategy and be able to sell it through the SMA channel. And so we think that that will pick up there. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks. Just another one around M&A for you guys. Just your comments around targeting either kind of distribution channels or continue to expand in the alternative space have been pretty consistent for the last couple of quarters. Curious to get your thoughts on your appetite for deals for most of the traditional products where you might still have some product gaps whether it's on the kind of core equity growth side or some of the fixed income core plus type of products or money market fund, so some of the gaps in some of the traditional products and the appetites there? Thanks. Gregory Johnson : Yes, I just say all the above of your list. You hit it pretty, pretty accurately. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, exactly I was going to say I think one of the points I made earlier on was accelerating and certain investment objectives. We have practically everything but there are some areas and you just referenced a couple of them right there that we should be much larger in. So yes we're very, very focused on this. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks. And then just the question around capital returns, I think in your release you talked about targeting 100% payout going forward. Is that on a GAAP net income basis because you're non-operating could be pretty lumpy, so I'm just kind of curious how that plays into the kind of the more tactical capital returns given some of the volatility in the non-operating income side? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, GAAP net income and target 100%. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thanks. Your next question is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked also but maybe just one more on M&A. Some other areas that maybe a potential answers just to get your thoughts, any view on either quantitative strategies or smart beta going up your organic smart beta with an acquisition. And then also you mentioned some distribution in Europe whether there were certain geographies where you could do small acquisitions that you think you could scale into your organization and also get a lot of traction. So wrapping that together with the timing of M&A and the cash that you have, you've always been patient obviously with a look with M&A, but is there a little bit more of a urgency is the wrong word, but through to be a pickup in appetite to do to deploy that cash sooner rather than later? Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean that we use the word action quite deliberately, I mean we're just being very active in assessing the various options that exist, but we're also focusing those down to a handful, instead of getting confused across too many places in to me investment objectives and so on. So we're focused on it. In terms of timing, we really, we can't put a time on that. We can even put a label on what we're going to do immediately. Next, I think that would be a mistake to do that. These are complicated transactions where small, medium, or large candidly, but our observation is, and we've said this in our prepared remarks is that there is a lot of strategic activity that's being discussed in the asset and wealth space and we are very well positioned to capitalize on that when we find something that fits well with us. So when that exactly is that I don't think it's the right thing to comment on but if we find something sooner rather than later, we will act upon it. And I would just add to I mean timing when you're making large, larger bets on asset classes. The performance and net flows will be secondary to what the markets do over the, over the next cycle. So that's important, it's a hard thing to do to anticipate but I think you just don't want to and then that's back to Matt these point of not blowing out blowing the balance sheet up or that your capital reserves by making a big bet on a market segment when we're near ten of the expansion. I think those are just factors that you have to weigh in to be prudent about where we make our strategic bets and I think if you see a smaller one less correlated you could move probably quicker or one where you use a little bit more equity in there to get new categories and get some scale out of it that would work as well. Jennifer Johnson : And I'd be remiss but in take this opportunity to plug the smart beta team that we have because it's, got stellar performance and it's been our fastest growth area, in our ETF space as well as some of our separate accounts. So from that I think that we would probably not be a buyer. We would continue to grow what we have. Brian Bedell : And that's great color, yes, maybe, just one other and related follow-up would be on Matthew your view of potentially outsourcing some of the administrative and back office fund functions as opposed to running them into and I know you've used the scale internally over a long-term period to maximize that, but is there any kind of change of view potentially in doing that going forward? Matthew Nicholls : So we already announced the outsourcing of our fund administration as you know and in fact that brings you back to answer the second part of Bill Katz's question which I didn't answer, which was about the cost savings that we announced of between, I think we said between $80 million and $85 million and I just want to be clear, I think those question was, how much of that we going to achieve in 2020. I think the answer for that is about $70 million to $75 million fully in 2020 - fiscal 2020 that is. The reason why those 10 missing from that is the other 10 is associated with the fund administration outsourcing, which we expect to save around that amount from 2021 because obviously that takes some time to implement. In terms of going further than that, we don't intend to outsource anything else at this time, but of course we continue to review our options around technology to be as efficient as we can. But right now we\u2026 Jennifer Johnson : Well, I would just say that our philosophy hasn't been necessarily that it has to be in-house for outsource it has been in many ways it - you do it as efficiently and cost effectively as you can. It was historically difficult to find outsourced providers that have the global footprint that we do. And because we were aggressive in leveraging low cost locations to support our business, it was -- it didn't make sense economically to do it, that is changing over time. And as that evolves, we always look at what makes the most sense for this business. So it is something we evaluate. And that's where we concluded with the fund administration, although we had looked at that many times before and concluded, it wasn't cost-effective at that point. But now the things have changed. Gregory Johnson : Yes. And also, earlier on that there wasn't a provider that existed that could serve what we needed to be served in front of administrations for that change. So, we took the action that we did, so same thing happens with transparency in the future, maybe that changes our view of that. Brian Bedell : And is fund accounting looped in with fund administration? Jennifer Johnson : Yes, yes. Gregory Johnson : Yes. Brian Bedell : Okay. It's okay, great. Okay. Thanks so much for all that detail. Really appreciate it. Gregory Johnson : Thanks, Brain. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now live. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just one here. So, you guys have spoken a bit about the elevated quarter day redemptions and some of these strategies. Did these strategies happen to overlap with any of the organizational changes and staffing adjustments that you flagged to PM teams? Jennifer Johnson : Did the redemptions have, is that -- is your question, did the -- were the redemption specifically the results of the organizational changes? If that's your question, no, the redemption -- Brennan Hawken : Or did they just overlap with the PM teams that were impacted by those adjustments? Jennifer Johnson : They did overlap, but they would. For example, one of the large redemptions was a result of a firm that had been acquired in the decision for them to bring the asset management business in house. So while it was, I believe, a global equity mandate, it wasn't correlated or anything to do with the PM changes? It was really because they had made a strategic decision to bring the assets in house. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. Gregory Johnson : And most of these changes were announced just recently. Jennifer Johnson : Yes, yes. Gregory Johnson : So it wouldn't be reflected in this quarter anyway on the PM changes. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I was referring to -- Brennan Hawken : Oh, you were saying that a result of the redemptions? You're making these changes that\u2026 Matthew Nicholls : No, I was referring to the July color but I'm thinking that maybe, there might be something\u2026 Brennan Hawken : All right. All right. Okay. Matthew Nicholls : Right, that we should prep for. Gregory Johnson : Yes, I mean, I think we expect some, but I think at the end of the day, this category, the devalued categories just under tremendous pressure of underperforming core and growth over the cycle. So I think the people that are left believe that this is a safe way to protect the portfolio that you really have, you've read the article, you have never seen more common holdings across active managers today than ever, where 50 top stocks are held by just about every fund. That's not the case with these, and I think, there are investors who like the fact that, you own a portfolio at 12, 13 times earnings and much more defensive and I would say Templeton today, if anything in the last quarter even got more defensive in their positioning where markets are. So I think at the end of the day, they will stand out, when you have a downturn or rent interest rates rise and growths under pressure. Brennan Hawken : Yes, those of us to cover financials can commiserate. Gregory Johnson : Yes. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking the questions. Gregory Johnson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live. Robert Lee : Great, thanks. Thanks for your patience. And Matt, welcome and good luck. Just a real quick question most of mine been asked but going back to the recurring M&A and strategic and organic growth. I'm just curious as you think about it, there any change in terms of your willingness to think of in a different ownership structures. I mean historically, like with benefits treat pretty much of -- then 100% acquirers, some competitors are more willing to do, majority ownership transaction. So as you think of the landscape, maybe particularly in the alternative space, there are also a shift taking place and your willingness to think of different structures that you've done historically? Jennifer Johnson : Well, I'll say that there's, we have some situations of joint ventures, I mean, actually, internationally, there'll be markets where we make decisions around, it's better to partner than it is to own 100% because maybe it's a difficult market for foreign manager, so we have an openness to that. Having said that, one of the things that has made us successful acquisitions is that we keep the independence of the investment team, and we take advantage and leverage all the support capabilities. And that's where you get real scale out of it. And so when you leave it independent and you see it with managers out there, you don't get that benefit. And you get confusion around distribution and you get a lack of commitment, and the conversation doesn't get as focused on the investment team. But obviously in the alternative business you have to structure compensation appropriately even when you have 100% ownership. So we're cognizant of that. And if it made sense we would do it, so like I said, we're not completely against it, but it is complicated to try to manage a JV much more so than it is when you have a 100% ownership. Gregory Johnson : Yes, and I think that that's probably a great summary on the distribution side somebody brought up or you opened and we've talked about that. And certainly minority stake in a captive market with captive distribution for a platform makes a lot of sense to own. But as Jenny said, I think creating a corporate culture and integrating and getting really all the leverage from what we offer as a global platform from the distribution and servicing side is very difficult when you own 60% or 70%, it just gets very complicated. You spend a lot of energy on things that really are not that production. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I mean subscale transactions along those lines really don't make any sense to us at all. And I think anything around M&A, from a financial perspective, this is sort of needless to say in a way, but we would expect the margin to be accretive to us. So we are absolutely driven around M&A by growth and diversification versus cost cutting, but obviously some of the larger transactions do come with very significant margin improvement opportunities. Robert Lee : Great, I appreciate the color. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for your clarifications and taking the question. So you've made some senior-level additions and organizational changes. I guess as you look forward from here, what additional hiring are you making and other potential changes that could make sense next as you're focused on optimizing the cost structure but also investing for growth? And related to that, as you're thinking about the pace of expense growth beyond 2020, would you envision that being more in line with inflation, how should we be thinking about that? Gregory Johnson : Well, I would start with -- I mean I think we've made a significant number of hires. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now that say there's a big gap here or there that -- and I think we spent a lot of time working on succession, and that's the norm for any CIO transitions. So I don't think we have any big plans of adding senior people in the area. And second part of the question, I'll flip to Matthew. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, and I think our cost structure will be guided based on how we're doing in the business overall, and where we need to invest, and how we're growing or not. Michael Cyprys : Great. And just a follow-up, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your approach in China to sourcing growth there, how that approach is evolving just given some of the recent regulatory changes? I understand you have a JV in China. Is the focus more with the JV partner or any appetite for building outside of the JV, and any sort of color you could share around AUM, flows, staffing, any progress that you can share? Jennifer Johnson : So we do have a JV, and we're excited about the opportunity to be able to acquire a 100%, and so that -- they've accelerated the pace of that, so we're certainly looking at that. We also have a [indiscernible] there where we have some investment personnel that are out of as well as some kind of support distribution side. The JV has great investment performance, and so they've seen some good flows. It's a difficult market, and it's always more complicated when you're in a JV structure, so we think that there is just great opportunity to own a 100%, and continue to try to grow in China. Gregory Johnson : And it's about $4 billion to $5 billion, so it's not included in our AUM, and it is profitable, the JV today, but not of the size where we'd like it to be. Michael Cyprys : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Gregory Johnson : Thank you everyone for participating on the call. And we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Rob, and I'll be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources\u2019 Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Joining me today is Matthew Nicholls, our CFO; and Jenny Johnson, President & Chief Operating Officer.  Our industry remains in the midst of rapid change that we work diligently to address in fiscal year 2019 by evolving certain parts of our business, are remaining steadfast in our core convictions. We are pleased to see improved sales and share in the U.S. retail channel. Our U.S. equity sales also improved again this quarter, reflecting strong performance and recent sales momentum continued in our U.S. fixed income strategies. Overall investment performance improved throughout most of the year, but trended down in the final months following global events that negatively impacted certain strategies. Capital allocation remains a very important focus for our Board, management team. We continue to actively evaluate the industry landscape for opportunities to grow and enhance our business through acquisitions. And we rewarded our investors through dividends and repurchases this fiscal year that amounted to 107% of net income.  I'd now like to open the line to your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : I just wanted to start with Benefit Street first. Can you provide us an update on fund raising and AUM growth since the deal has closed? And also do you have an AUM target for the senior opportunities Senior Opportunities Fund II? Greg Johnson : As we said on the last call, I mean we are very pleased with the progress with Benefit Street and I think the last year has really been getting our distribution platform up to speed and training. And we had over 350 global meetings, and introducing the new funds that they're offering. And I think we're excited about what that means for this year in terms of flows. And as you know, on the institutional side, you have not a steady flow, but when you close funds, you have obviously a large one-time flow and we're expecting to see two or three of those events in the next year. And hopefully we'll target somewhere over 3 billion, 4 billion range flows with everything, works and markets stay steady.  We've also registered funds and are in the process of getting retail products out there whether it\u2019s a BDC with some of our major distributors as well as the potential of introducing interval funds for more of the retail and wealth management platforms. So, very pleased with the progress to-date there. And I would say in the last quarter, we had one CLO closed that you asked about, closed for $233 million or so, but that was the only really a fund raise in the last four to six months. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks Greg. And then just one follow-up on the 55.8 basis points fee rate. When you exclude market appreciation and any kind of diversion beta, what are your thoughts on the overall fee rate going forward given organic mix shift? And also any potential pricing adjustments that you could do to enhance growth? Matthew Nicholls : Hey, it\u2019s Matthew, Craig. I would say that it\u2019s a very tough question to predict, fee rate. Our mix of products is evolving somewhat the past quarter, for example, fee rate came down slightly based on the fact that our international global products came down a little bit through increased redemption activity that we talked about. But I think further guidance on the average fee rate is difficult to predict. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Davitt : My first question, there\u2019s been a few high profile Morningstar downgraded just some of Hasenstab\u2019s funds. Historically there\u2019s been a high correlation between flows and these ratings. I\u2019d be curious to get your thoughts and if you think that correlation is still as strong given all changes in the distribution ecosystem and through that lens are you expecting accelerated outflows as a result? Greg Johnson : Yes. I think clearly there is a correlation and obviously the more recent underperformance puts pressure on some of the Morningstar ratings. But I think this fund is really in a category of its own and there is no real one clear peer group for this kind of unconstrained global bond, bond that tends to have no correlation with beta or duration. So, I think it always has a place in a portfolio regardless and people that have used the fund in the past understand what it brings to a typical 60, 40 or typical portfolio to lower risk and that hasn\u2019t changed. But no, we don\u2019t expect any -- I think the relative performance is the key in the short run more than the ratings. And obviously the fourth quarter, September with Argentina you had some what was up until that point very strong relative performance downturn in that. But that turns really quickly in that market because every fund looks so different. So, we aren\u2019t at as optimistic on flows right now based on that September, but as I said before that can turn very quickly as the markets move. Patrick Davitt : Right. Okay. And my follow up, Matthew now that you\u2019ve been in the position a bit longer now. Any updated thoughts on the potential to get even more lean on the expense side heading into next year? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I think that we\u2019ve just been through a very disciplined budget process for 2020. When we last commented on this, I think we had referenced guidance again to -- for 2020 to be at just about 2019 flat. I think we can say now that we believe we can come in a little bit below that target. And I also believe that we have a little bit more flexibility than I first thought before we started the budget process. But I just still continue to point to the guidance that we've provided beforehand on just a little bit below 2019 for expense 2020. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mike Carrier : I guess too more expensive, you guys did a lot over the past year or so just in terms of driving efficiencies, but also investing the business. You mentioned like the \u201820 outlook in terms of down a bit. I guess just kind of bigger picture, how are you thinking about the investments in the business? And if, we\u2019ve been into an environment where, whether it's flows or markets are weaker, are there other, whether it's outsourcing or kind of chunkier, big things that could drive the expense base lower over a longer period of time? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think, we have been working hard and as you pointed to we've announced the outsourcing our fund administration business, which we\u2019re ahead on that, which is why our IS&T expenses went up a little bit more than planned for the quarter. I'd say as well that we spent a lot of time reviewing other parts of our IS&T business. And we think there is some opportunity there to decrease our expenses a little bit more, if we had to. But generally speaking, as we've already referred to, where we say, if we tended to try and reinvest that in other very important parts of our business, in particular on the investment side. Jenny Johnson : Yes, I mean, one of the things on the technology is just investment and data science around for our investment teams with a centralized data like and data scientists embedded in the teams. And so that's been an area of growth in our expenses on the IS&T side. So we're trying to figure out where we can save, so that we can reinvest it. Mike Carrier : And then just on the follow-up. So, on the strategic growth initiatives, you also -- you've been active whether it\u2019s solutions, ETFs, a lot of different areas. And it sounds like on the M&A front you\u2019re still spending a good amount of time looking at potential opportunities. I guess, if we don't see something say over the next year, is it mostly about price, and especially, if you're going after growth areas, or are there other factors that you think are challenging in this environment to pursue some of those strategic initiatives? Greg Johnson : I mean, I would characterize progress in terms of M&A and acquisition targets as quite good progress in all the areas that we are focused on and referred to in the previous call. And we feel cautiously optimistic about our options in that regard. I'd also add a nuance to our commentary from last quarter, which is to say that while we value our cash and conservative balance sheet, we are readying willing to utilize a meaningful portion of our cash to help meet these strategic objectives. As mentioned last quarter, any performance scenario will continue with low leverage and strong financial flexibility, but this should not be confused with our unwillingness use our cash. Jenny Johnson : I am just going to add, is it mostly about price, I mean obviously price matters. But our approach in thinking around M&A is absolutely around a growth story. So, it has to hit a category where we're filling product gaps that we don't have, where we're getting distribution capability that we may not be as strong in, or a geography. And that's first and foremost cost cutting, then gets to be a secondary benefit of that and then of course it has to be at the right price. Matthew Nicholls : And I think just to add on price it's not like going out and deciding when you're going to buy a specific security. I mean, it's when the right needs are available and sometimes you end up paying a little bit more but it's got to be -- we look at it as something that we're going to build over many market cycles and have that time to grow an asset class that will be around for a long time. So, I think it -- sometimes it's easy to look at the world and say well gee I\u2019ll buy this when you have sell-off but that's not realistic sometimes the sellers aren't selling in that bottom part of the cycle. Greg Johnson : Yes. And the current valuations, certain asset classes, frankly, reflect the evaluations of companies that contain certain asset classes reflect the reality of where the market is I would say several of the cases that we get into it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to look back on to the global macro global bond complex, it's -- I understand that this -- the shift in the recent few weeks and months has moved more to a cautious stance, Michael Hasenstab is kind of, I believe almost something like half in cash and at least and a big fund. So just in terms of maybe that macro view and how it\u2019s being read by salesforce and the advisors and do you expect that repositioning? If that's sort of a more of a -- sort of I guess more of a permanent is the wrong word but more of a strategic shift. Do you think that will significantly impact the sales engine for that complex? Matthew Nicholls : I mean, it's hard to say, I think it is clearly a more conservative stance and derisking of a lot of the EM currencies. But again, this goes back to my point about how markets move and how relative performance can swing so quickly. So I don't think there's a lot of funds that have a similar defensive position today, which sometimes I think you bring up correctly that, what does that mean for a sales environment? I think, we've always stood behind the PM\u2019s convictions and doing what's right again for the long-term and having cash in that kind of fund. It has never really been a problem. It would be more of an equity fund, obviously, but because of the liquidity constraints some times that having that higher cash is important, and if you get in a disruptive environment which, that team feels like there's a serious potential for, that cash can be very efficient in not having to sell securities but going in and buying during the dislocation. So, I think some of the best track records over time are built when you have that ammunition to buy instead of sell and that's really what that fund is positioned for. But I think, it's hard to say what impact will that have on the sales. But as I said earlier -- my earlier comments, it\u2019s a little bit different of a product, people are used to the higher cash in this fund and some get comfort from having that when issues come up with certain holdings on liquidity and that\u2019s part of the combination here. Brian Bedell : And has that hedged for too higher rates then reversed largely in the fund as well? Matthew Nicholls : Not reversed, just on the shorter to medium term and still negative duration on a longer, but definitely that\u2019s focused on the longer end of the curve and the longer and more medium and shorter end. Brian Bedell : Got it. And then just my follow up is on the outsourcing, the fund administration. Can you just review again like what parts of the fund administration or outsourcing , what you still have in house? I believe you\u2019re still doing, for my question, fund accounting in house, but I think the custody is outsourced, just maybe just to clear that up and it seems middle opus. And that is it across most of your mutual fund complex or just portions. I am trying to get a sense of what could be further outsourced in the future and how much you have now? Jenny Johnson : Well. Yes, I mean you\u2019re correct that we historically had outsourced the custody of course and had kept the fund administration in house. And part of that was because with our global footprint it was difficult to find somebody who could cover all the areas that we tend to cover. And now the providers have stepped up. And so we\u2019re looking to outsource all the fund administration. And many of the work that\u2019s done in custody you have to do in fund administration. So we found some amount of duplication. But because we were early into lower cost environment, it was hard to find providers that could be competitive pricing wise. And now as others have done that, we\u2019ve funded both the coverage of what we do as far as geography as well as the cost is now much more competitive. Brian Bedell : And then just the timing of the outsourcing of this. Is this going to be converted in the next couple of quarters or is it longer-term? Greg Johnson : No, this would be over 2020 conversion and we\u2019ll start realizing benefits from 2021. Brian Bedell : And that\u2019s in your guidance already for the expenses. Greg Johnson : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. You mentioned number of large block withdrawals in the coming quarter, I guess the current quarter. $800 million global fix income, $1.6 billion for mutual shares and there were some larger block redemptions this past quarter. Now we expect the institutional business be lumpy, you\u2019re lumpiness is really more on the redemption side. So any common themes of the bigger block outflows, are you hearing -- is it performance issue, distribution issues, active to passive pricing? So any common themes in these sort of different asset classes and which you\u2019re seeing? And ultimately, Franklin has been in redemption for I don\u2019t know six or so plus years, what is the path back to inflows for Franklin. What if any milestones that you\u2019re holding out for yourself with that regard? Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. First of all, it\u2019s probably all of the above on some of the lumpy redemptions, but in particular the large one coming this quarter with mutual shares in particular was really a large broker dealer distributor that\u2019s moving assets to their in house funds and not really performance related but more about funds just moving in house. The Templeton continues to be under pressure and this relates to what you talked about inflows and 6 or 7 years. And obviously for us having a lower base of U.S. assets or U.S. funds are doing extremely well, growing market share, very strong inflows accelerating. But that pales compared to the large Templeton deep value, mutual series deep value assets that we have.  So that's really -- the catalyst is going to be the rotation of value and growth. And then also the -- we talked earlier about many of the new initiatives that we've funded, whether it's around the solution side, the SMA side. A lot of resources have been put into that. We've been very successful, I would say in the last year or two to getting on platforms. We -- our multi-asset solutions group just recently got on two major platforms and I think those are going to drive flows over time.  Now they'll drive flows at a little bit lower of a margin maybe than your traditional 40 Act funds, but ones that we think can be very positive, and only a few players are going to be competitive in that space that have the scale to do that. And ETFs as well continue to be an area of growth for us and just crossing 5 billion. And again, getting to the size where we have more distribution opportunities opening up and having been on platforms now for -- or been in existence for 3 years minimum in some cases getting on platforms. And that's really, I would say is where the most progress has been made on the U.S. side is these new multi-asset solutions, ETFs and getting onto traditional platforms, as well as hopefully getting on to new technology platforms that emerge. Jenny Johnson : And I\u2019d just add on the institutional side, there were some big headwinds this year in, obviously the Argentina, Greg talked about it. We also had a new CIO introduced on the Templeton Global Equity Group. You're playing defense in those meetings, they had a sub-20 clients representing 40 billion in assets, hitting 13 cities in 5 days. That's what your conversation ends up being.  Having said that, we've got 4 billion in unfunded in international institutional business. Our pipeline in the U.S. institutional has doubled in size. We actually converted 9 new prospects. And so they're green shoots underneath. It's just you're mixing it in a time, which is some big headwinds. And I think we have some good green shoots, as Greg mentioned, on the retail side with some big placements of our model business and some good growth there. Greg Johnson : And I would give another example in the emerging markets group that has new leadership, and excellent performance in institutional quality process and really we think an opportunity for institutional assets for the first time. And we're excited about that as that team now is getting on platforms for institutional searches and we haven't had that opportunity in the past. Ken Worthington : And then the follow up, there was a delay into two institutional fundings, I think it was $2 billion. Is there any risk that they don't fund or is funding a certainty and it's just a timing that is unknown? Jenny Johnson : If the money is not in hand, there's always a risk. But there's nothing that indicates that there's any kind of risk that we believe they will be funded. Operator : The next question from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Dan Fannon : Just on the 4 billion of the international kind of backlog or unfunded wins, I guess in context of I think we've gotten a number like that from you before versus a year ago or other points in time, like how do we think about that relative to previous periods? Just so we can have as I said some context. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I mean that\u2019s good question. And that's probably why we haven't talked about that number in the past. Because I think the hard part is the timing for you to figure out when those assets come in. And sometimes they take longer than you think and could be a year out, could be next month. So, we've always been kind of hesitant to even talk about that. And that number is really just what's in the offshore international institutional flows that is a few more domestically but I'm not sure what you do with that number actually. So good point. Dan Fannon : And just a follow-up on kind of the global bond, it's been a lots of written about the performance earlier, you talked about the Morningstar changes. I guess can you talk about what you're doing internally with yourself salesforce and your distributor -- to basically play more defense here I assume to kind of keep assets in. I don't think it's so much as a gross sales issue, it\u2019s also a redemption given the kind of level of underperformance and as said the headlines has created? So is there some campaign or something that you guys are doing internally to get in front of this and be more proactive? Greg Johnson : Well, we are and we're trying to do as much as we can, and we have a new piece going out that talks about the repositioning and some of the recent moves with the fund. But again, I mean, I still point to the long-term performance, it's really unparalleled in this and we've had plenty of periods where you've had things not work out in the short run. And you just point to that long term record and how it lowers your risk in a portfolio and focus on those things. And as you -- it's a risky world out there with highly valued assets on every metric and the story here is going forward what's going to defend your portfolio. And I think that's an important message and one that our salesforce is working on. Jenny Johnson : And we just came out in October with a piece called the four pillars to face a world of uncertainty, which is, we're positioning it as you want this in your portfolio, because it's a hedge to many of the other positions that people take in and trying to lay it out for it clearly. And it's been well received. So very, very recent. Operator : Our next question from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Jeremy Campbell : First, sorry, if I missed this on your answer to Craig's question earlier, but what was the revenue and AUM contribution from Benefit Street during the quarter? Greg Johnson : We don\u2019t break it out like that. Jeremy Campbell : No rough sense? Greg Johnson : Well, we had revenue was stable with the last quarter, which is about $51 million. Jeremy Campbell : And then just kind of more broadly speaking, just kind of wondering what your thoughts are around what's happening over at UBS right now with the elimination of SMA fees to asset managers? Do you think this is kind of like a new front on the industry-wide fee pressure? And does that dampen your outlook at all about growing Franklin's SMA footprint or your kind of your desire for wealth management M&A target that you guys called out in the prepared remarks? Jenny Johnson : I mean, interestingly, with our Fiduciary Trust high net worth business, we've never charged a fee on top of our own proprietary products, right. It was always kind of a conflict around that. So they reversed that a bit by making the product free and charging the fee at the top of the house. It is just one of those -- it just feels like a conflict when you do that. But our experience has been that clients absolutely want open architecture and they desire to have outside products in. So I think that not everything in SMAs is going free. Having said that, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s fee pressure all over the business. And we\u2019re all going to have to prove out our value on our fees, no different than you had to do on the institutional side and the retail side. And I think this is just an extension to that. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think there has been a little bit of market confusion over that change that was really an entity that is not getting the fee, but there is still a fee being charged around the account and the underlying managers are still being paid a fee, it is my understanding. So, we all know SMA is a way to accelerate shrinking margins versus your traditional 40 Act fund because the pricing is controlled by the distributor and that\u2019s not a great trend, but it\u2019s a trend you can\u2019t ignore and one that we believe is a business we\u2019re going to be aggressively in versus trying to defend against it. So, I think that\u2019s part of our solutions thinking it\u2019s a change of mindset we have and we think an important growth area for us. And I think you\u2019re correct that it will result in a lower margin but it will result in larger assets and hope that, that will offset it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Bill Katz : So, Matt, let's come back to the expense discussion for a moment, I guess you've been on a month-to-month with AUM in sort of discussing the flow dynamics, so dancing around with different agitators and so forth and so I'm just trying to understand your sort of phraseology here in terms of doing a little bit better on the cost side. So I guess, is there a way to think about that we're talking down zero to 5%, more than that and then what is the revenue and/or flow assumptions that you're counterbalancing that expense out of \u2026? Matthew Nicholls : Look I\u2019d say Bill that it\u2019s too early to go much further than what we said. But if forced to go into a little detail, I\u2019d say probably zero to 2.5% down from 2019 on the expenses. Bill Katz : Okay. And there is a revenue back up? Matthew Nicholls : And revenue is largely consistent. And also just I don\u2019t think we addressed the question which was also related to this earlier on about the average fee rate, so I think we confuse that with what we thought something different. But if the question was where do we think the average fee rate is heading for our overall mix of business, we forecast that to be roughly flat and that\u2019s based on a whole series of assumptions around the mix of business internationally, domestically, the growth will return to assets offsetting some of our business that is more under pressure from a fee perspective. Bill Katz : Okay. And just my follow up Matt, so you mentioned the nuance of potentially more size of a deal that\u2019s I interpreted. What\u2019s changed in your thinking and then when you look at the landscape of what the size of the deals have gone on over the last several years, what gives you confidence that the market would be receptive to those types of things? Matthew Nicholls : I think as Jenny mentioned we think when we look at the some of the opportunities that exists in the marketplace, certainly not easy and I think we discussed that last quarter. But we see areas that we can fill at Franklin, we have a tremendous chassis and a core business with leading products from a global level across many countries. But we think we can grow that further by filling some of the gaps that we have, whether it's becoming larger institution in the U.S., whether it's having a bit more alternative assets. Then there's some other frankly products, if you will that we already have but were quite smaller, and if we were larger, we think will be more successful. So I wouldn't guide you towards thinking we're going to do some mega transaction. But the short list of ideas that we thought about, we think, create growth opportunities for us, given our current business without having to drive down expenses, sort of the number one bullet point. However, we should say that there are obviously some cost aspects to all of this consolidation in the business that we would be able to capitalize on. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Brennan Hawken : I think, earlier Matthew, you flagged that outsourcing the cost to shift to greater amount of outsourcing is included in your expense guide for 2020. Are there any other sort of unusual or what you would expect to be non-recurring items that would be included in that guidance? Matthew Nicholls : Not at the moment. Brennan Hawken : And then when we think about the -- it looks like of the $201 million or so of non-recurring and acquisition-related expenses, there is some portion that's recurring. So, whatever, let's call it $150 or so million that's non-recurring, that would suggest like a 5% core growth rate in expenses in your guide. You flagged that you're doing some investing and everything like that, but number one, is that right -- a fair way to think about it and number two, can you talk about what kind of returns, or what kind of ROI that you guys have, what's the hurdle for making some of these investments just given the really challenging backdrop that we have here for the industry? Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think, well, there's lots of questions in that. I would say that we should follow-up separately to go through that in more detail. I think the assumption about an increase in expense is built into to our modeling. I think that is not accurate. If -- I would say, the reason why we outlined the non-recurring items, you're correct that there is an element of this associated with our Benefit Street acquisition, that does include around $79 million for the next three years, which is recurring, but then that drops off, so we wanted to try and make that clear. Otherwise, you'll be looking at our Benefit Street acquisition, assuming that it's zero margin business which is very misleading. So that's the reason why we wanted to put that into the table, but in terms of our future costs and how we look at investments, I wouldn't say we apply a classic ROI to it. We -- it has to work for our business in terms of scaling or creating more opportunities for our investment teams, our distribution efforts and we certainly don't look at things on a three-month or six-month or one year basis, it has to make sense over a multi-year perspective. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Harris : Thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit about your international distribution capabilities today and what you might be trying to do to improve them which you site as a focus area for the firm going forward? Matthew Nicholls : I would say, not a lot has changed. I mean, for the international capability, it doesn't have the benefit of some of the momentum we're seeing in the US in terms of municipal bond sales and muni funds. That -- the flows there are more -- rely more on global bonds. Templeton, we are seeing strong flows in the Franklin US growth products. K2 would be more of a focus there as well. So I think for us it is a huge value of the company and franchise and one where in the year ahead as part of it is getting Benefit Street gaining some products up on in the Luxembourg base E cap fund which we're in the process of doing, leveraging Benefit Street on the institutional side as well would be one. And just I think relating to the acquisition side is, we feel like there is some underutilized capacity for more product under that distribution network. But again, if you look at pockets for us where it's not -- it's a different story where you have India had a very strong year of growth and inflows, Taiwan very strong year. So there are pockets that are doing very well throughout the globe that have a different product mix than maybe our traditional one. But I think just generally speaking, we feel like we can take on more and that's part of our acquisition thinking on that. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Cyprys : Just wanted to circle back on expenses, hoping you could help with some of the moving pieces here. So we hear the guidance that to be slightly down next year. So it's a combination of an investment spend and expense cuts. But I guess if you could just help quantify how much you're cutting, where specifically, I know you mentioned fund add and I just what else, how meaningful that? And then conversely, you are also making investments I think on the tech side with the data lake, how much are you guys investing, if you could help quantify that and if you could provide any sort of color around these investments? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think what we'd say is that we think that on information systems and technology we have some room to move on that. As I mentioned a moment ago, perhaps up to several percentage points more efficient, see there. I think beyond that it's very early to give guidance on any specific line item and I would just keep referring back to the fact that we are confident, all else remaining equal that we will be able to be down slightly on our 2019 expenses as a whole. Matthew Nicholls : And I just would add, I mean I think we look at this, we recognize where the pressure that the industry is under, and it is very top of mind with all the senior management to look at span of control and every kind of saving that we can generate to continue to invest in the parts that we think are going to be incremental to getting inflows and in a few years. So I think we're all very focused on that. But just very hard to come out with, what does that number look like in two or three years, other than we're kind of attacking every angle. Greg Johnson : Yes, I think we also demonstrated in the fourth quarter that the discipline we have around our most important expense which is variable compensation and compensation for the firm, I think we demonstrated that we get the balance right, do what's right for the company, but also do what's right for shareholders. And then when it comes to the other components of our expenditure, I think we have very clear reasons why there were moves in each item. So IS&T, we actually expected that to be down, but it was up just because we wanted to do the right thing and continue to make more progress than we expected. That's what we did. And that does not mean that increase is likely to continue. Actually that's going to come down.  Our G&A, another included some intangible impairments both this quarter and last quarter, we don't -- what we would hope that wouldn't repeat. We don't expect it to, and when we analyze and drill down G&A, we think there's some room there also. On occupancy expense, we've talked a fair amount about this, the reason why that spiked so much in the last quarter as guided the previous quarter. It's because we've completed our campus in San Mateo. We also have new real estate in Poland, but that's going to be all offset by an increase in revenue attributed to our efficiency drives across our state ownership, including some very attractive lease streams that frankly pay both the building of our headquarters here in San Mateo and the running of them. So I think with each one of our items, whether it's comp and benefits, IS&T, occupancy expense, G&A and others, we have plans on the each one of these. We think we have flexibility under each one as needed. We've described the fact that some of that's offset by the investment that we are adamant we want to continue to make which is why we don't refer to a forecasted margin. But it doesn't mean that we won't take that action as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter where we took action across all the key items. Michael Cyprys : Okay, thanks for the color on that. And then just maybe on China, given the regulatory change and marketing up -- market opening up in China, can you just give us an update on where your business stands today in China? How you're thinking about the opportunity set there over the next couple of years and what sort of actions that you're taking to capitalize on this? Greg Johnson : Well, we are I think like most looking at taking control of our joint venture that we were one of the early ones with Sealand and are in the process of taking a majority stake in that and we have other options and other licenses that we can take different tax. And I think China, size wise is, I'm looking at Jenny, because we don't include it in our assets and I'm trying to -- I think it's $5 billion, it's profitable, it's not obviously a major contributor to our earnings, but it's a profitable number and growing and it has had good performance. But I think like many, we look at China as a very tricky market. We think it's a tremendous opportunity for growth. But the thought of continuing with the partnership versus going alone in that market, I think is one that you have to think very carefully. And I'll ask Jenny if she's got any additional\u2026 Jenny Johnson : No, I think that's right. I mean for us it's been about we'd like to own 100% if that can make sense and -- but whether or not we can -- we end up doing there, we always have also our UEFI option as Greg said. So it keeps our options open. A big area of focus has been integrating some of the investment capabilities with our emerging market team so that they can collaborate on Asia research which we think is important. And that has been going very well as well as it gives us optionality when we get institutional interest mandates to either talk to our UEFI team or JV team. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions. Patrick Davitt : Hey, thank you for the follow-up. You mentioned the potential for $3 billion to $4 billion from Benefit Street, but chunky, should we expect placement fees on the expense side with that, and if so, is that in the expense guidance? Jenny Johnson : We would have some placement fees although we're really trying to have our own institutional team do the big push there. So I think we've kept it where we have divided that up a bit, but we are hoping that it comes through our institutional team. Patrick Davitt : Okay, perfect. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I mean we'd have to look into that. I mean, I'm assuming that's built into their model for the year, but I don't -- we don't have that at the top of our head there. Patrick Davitt : And then on the $4 billion pipeline, one last one, could you just give us a little bit more color maybe on the fee mix of that even if it's just better or worse than the average? And maybe broadly, if there are any kind of signals you think might start unlocking that or is there just no color at all on the second part there? Matthew Nicholls : I think that would just be embedded in the guidance I gave earlier on about fee rate for the year. The Benefit Street across the board has a much higher fee rate, as you know, given the business versus the rest of our franchise. So that actually helps us across the year to be confident that we -- in our statement that we think our fee rate will remain stable. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the call back to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks. Greg Johnson : Well, thank you everyone for participating on our call and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",

Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Operator : Good morning. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin. Greg Johnson : Hello and thank you for joining us today to discuss first quarter results. With me is President and Chief Operating Officer, Jenny Johnson who will be assuming the role of CEO next month; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. Financial results improved this quarter reflecting strong financial markets and our ongoing commitment to effective expense management, which drove improved profitability. We continue to experience outflows this quarter for reasons discussed in the commentary we released earlier this morning. But we are encouraged to see traction in several important initiatives, including our efforts to expand our multi-asset solutions and ETF businesses. We also believe that our balance sheet is one of our most under-appreciated assets as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth. Earlier this month, we announced plans to acquire two companies that will expand Fiduciary Trust assets under management by 50% and expand our physical presence in two important markets. We also returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through share repurchases in our regular dividend this quarter, which the Board increased to $0.27 per share in December. After more than 15 years, my role as CEO of the firm will come to an end after our annual meeting next month. I'm very confident in Jenny's leadership and vision for the future of Franklin Templeton and together we are genuinely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. While this will be my last call with you as CEO, I will remain Executive Chairman of the Board and will continue to participate on our earnings calls going forward. I'd now like to open the line for your questions. Operator : Our first question today is coming from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Ken Worthington : So you've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in Wealth Management. So couple questions around that. So first, why are you thinking wealth management is a good place to invest here maybe you can flush out, are there synergies between wealth management and the rest of Franklin and maybe any synergies as well. And then may be cleaning up, I think when you guys bought Fiduciary, I think it's like 20 years ago. I remember it had about maybe $15 billion or so of AUM. I could be wrong, but that's my recollection and I don't think it's all that much bigger today maybe 15 billion to 20 billion these days before - for these deals. So it hasn't really grown that much, if at all, over the last 20 years. So, given you're doing a bunch of bolt-ons. How do you expect to do a better job growing these wealth management assets today, than at least my perception of what you've done over the last 20 years? Jenny Johnson : Well I'll go ahead and take that today post-acquisition I think Fiduciary is about $29 billion and there's no question wealth is hard to grow, but it's incredibly sticky, once you have it. And we think that it's both important for us as a firm from a distribution, but also as you're seeing fee based advisors trying to add more services, you justify basically the fee that their client pay every month. They're trying to add on more than just investment management. And so, some of the capabilities that Fiduciary has we think can be packaged to be able to provide additional services to advisors. For example in this most recent acquisitions we not only expanded into two geographies that are excellent geographies to be in for wealth management, but we added services. So Athena Capital is incredibly well known for their impact investing in OCIO. We think that Dr. Lisette Cooper can be helpful to us in more of the issue work that we're very focused on doing as well as Pennsylvania Trust has special need trust capabilities, which is essentially helping families who have a child with special needs and not worried about how to care for them beyond the say the parents surviving, and that's an opportunity of growth. But that also can be something that we can work with our financial advisors as they have clients with those needs. We can bifurcate both the trust administration as well as the investment [bifurcate] capability on it. Matthew Nicholls : I think I'll just add something to that it's Matthew. The multiple that we pay for these businesses is reasonable. We think and it helps us capitalize on some of the broader expenses that we have embedded within Fiduciary Trust. So essentially by having more assets and clients, it makes our overall wealth business more efficient. This is probably the beginning of our strategy to grow Fiduciary Trust in the second leg if you will. You're right, Ken it's been a number of years since we've had a growth strategy around it inorganically. But it wouldn't surprise us if we doubled the size of Fiduciary Trust over the next year or two, by using this strategy. Greg Johnson : And I would just add, I think we've always had that as you know, being on these calls for years, it's always been a goal of ours to - within our M&A to increase the size, but I think there's just a few more opportunities today with some of the pressure on smaller firms keeping up keeping pace with technology, spending and services that are required for their investors. So, we're just seeing a few more opportunities for roll ups. Ken Worthington : And then just really broadly Jenny you're now officially or tend to be officially in the role as CEO. Maybe just highlight your priorities for the next two or three years. What are you hoping to accomplish? Any directional changes that is worth highlighting to us? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : I think we - it's continuing on a path that we've been focused on for the last couple of years, which is we bucket the business and growth opportunities, kind of, in three places, so one is just protecting the core and that's making sure that the products and capabilities that we have are best in breed. And if you think about on the investment management side, there has been a lot of focus and efforts around leveraging data science to enhance what we're doing on our core products. And I think our fixed income team has done some really exciting new things combining active and quant. So again, it's just making sure that you have best-in-breed in your existing core and then from the second category is what we call growth accelerators things like growing our high net worth business, things like expanding in geographies that maybe we're not as deepened as we'd like to be adding product capability that maybe we're not as strong in, or don't have as much coverage and then also distribution capabilities. So for example, we've always been really underrepresented in U.S. institutional that would be an area of interest for us to continue to grow. And then finally, I think we would all be foolish not to believe that the technology industrial revolution existing today is going to have disruption on our businesses. So making sure that we're investing in things that may be won't be meaningful or material in even the next five years. But that we think could be very disruptive to business over the long run. And so that's - you see some of the investments that we're doing in things like a token vault, and also our innovation lab, which really just enables us to keep an eye on where the industry is evolving. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to start off with the - obviously the global fixed income franchise and the increase in outflows, maybe just if you can talk about what you're saying to the financial advisors, we've seen sales obviously come down there pretty sharply in the last three quarters, and even also weighing a little bit on the global equity side so maybe the conversations with advisors, how that's going. Maybe the sort of the tempo into January, and would that Morningstar request, I guess, would you say there is a certain level of AUM that might be at risk, just based on that reclass in the performance or maybe just a little extra color around that? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think first and foremost, I mean the messaging is really that one this - it doesn't fit neatly into any category. So I think the people that are familiar and have sold the fund do it for defensive purposes. They do it, because it lowers the risk clearly against the big drivers of the interest rates and market beta and it really complements portfolios well. So that's the messaging that we continue to drive through the retail side. And I think some of the heightened redemptions that you saw towards the end of the quarter or at the end of the year. I think some of that is always tax driven in selling when you have a sector in a very strong bull market that had a tough period. That will be something that you'll just see heightened levels of redemptions and we've seen that come off a bit. It's hard to kind of gauge what the reclassification can do. I can just say from experience with this asset class is how quickly it moves around. And just with geopolitical events and movements within global macro, we can see quick rebounds and performance really within a week or two. So and I think the most of our advisors and shareholders are - understand that and that's just the messaging that we want to continue to drive. But this is a defensive way, that's not co-related to many of the drivers in your market and continue to reinforce that message and how it's done in past down cycles, but it's clearly defensively positioned and that's the messaging that we continue to drive. Jenny Johnson : And I think they did a very good piece on the Coronavirus and just reminding whether or not this one is going to be a very serious epidemic or not that you always have tail risk in portfolios and it's good to have that diverse portfolio. And this is an insurance policy positioned very defensively. And that has been well received by clients. Brian Bedell : So are you seeing improvement in the flow momentum in January versus what we saw late in the fourth quarter in this area? Greg Johnson : Yes, I would say still pressure but definitely better than what we saw in the prior quarter. Yeah redemption side a lot better, lot better. Brian Bedell : And then maybe just back to the M&A strategy, maybe as you think about through diversifying into different areas, or expanding that Fiduciary high net worth strategy, is it and also in the commentary about the undervalued balance sheet and the $3.5 billion of excess cash - if you [guys] just maybe becoming more of a rollup of other private wealth managers over the long-term? And if so, is that more of a sort of a bolt-on strategy or would you actually try to be more toward have a strategy of more like integrating those firms into Fiduciary and having it be a large integrated platform? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think it's a combination of those two things and wealth. It's both integration of certain aspects of the business Brian, but it's also a potential roll-ups, I think we should make clear, this is more of a - we don't expect to expand broadly across wealth management. This is a specialized ultra-high-net-worth franchise where we see significant opportunities in different states with different client bases that, as I mentioned a second ago, capitalize on the foundation that we have with Fiduciary Trust. So that's what this is all about. So we shouldn't confuse that important aspect of our strategy with what we're doing overall as a Company. We do have many other aspects of the growth that we're focused on this, Jenny just pointed out, including across the traditional asset management business, distribution various products alternatives institutional, for example, and some of those ideas are much larger ideas that are in our pipeline and as we move quarter-to-quarter where our list is getting shorter and shorter in terms of where we would actually take action, we hope in the next year. Brian Bedell : So we should expect more utilization of the balance sheet for M&A over the next say, a couple of years or so. Greg Johnson : Yes. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Craig Siegenthaler : Just looking at the decline in expenses and the guidance too, how are you able to invest in new technologies, distribution and also product, while also able to reduce total cost? Jenny Johnson : So I'll take that. So I mean one of the things that you over time we've always had a global footprint, and so there has been opportunity for us to ship positions to lower cost regions as well as historically as a global provider there were often not service providers who could really accommodate our global platform. And so, we always had to keep these things in-house and it's hard when you keep it in-house to scale it and so, most recently we announced an outsourcing of some portion of our fund administration. And then I would say, just getting better at looking at massive amount of data like a market data research and finding opportunities there where historically that was probably managed more by the investment teams needs as opposed to centrally and finding out where you have overlap. So it's just continuing to scour through and figuring out where those opportunities exist. Matthew Nicholls : I think the other thing on that is we've candidly just become in fairly short order, I would say much more disciplined about investing in projects that we see really moving the needle and moving away from sort of hobby-type luxury-type investments that we were making in our business for good reasons candidly, but given the shift in the environment we've just gotten much more disciplined about that. And frankly we found other areas within the cost structure that provide more flexibility in the event that the market continues to be challenged. So I think our guidance has moved a little bit as we've noted in our prepared remarks to the positive in terms of the costs that we can reduce and we're very confident about the flexibility of our cost structure. Craig Siegenthaler : And just as my follow up I have one on U.S. distribution, what is your business strategy for targeting U.S. RIAs? And I'm talking outside of Fiduciary Trust and CNN and Penn Trust, it's the fastest growing segment of U.S. Wealth and within that, what sort of Franklin products are you finding the RIAs most interested in? Jenny Johnson : RIAs want more or less kind of traditional and then to the extent its traditional ETFs are obviously very popular. So SMAs are popular there and as we talked about, we hired somebody to run our SMA business and that's starting to grow. Our ETFs had its best quarter ever, with $1.2 billion. As a matter of fact, the launch of our FLCO, which is our core bond was I think the third-fastest growing ETF in 2019. So those are interesting for that channel, but how do you really get mindshare of the RIA, and that's what we're talking about those additional services as RIAs had to grow their business into more of a wealth management business finding ways that we can have tools and take some of the capabilities that Fiduciary Trust provides to its clients to provide its value-added services that aren't particularly more costly for us to add to it, but can be leveraged more broadly, there. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now. Patrick Davitt : First one, on these kind of bolt-on deals of Fiduciary Trust how should we think about those running through the financials from a revenue and operating income standpoint and then maybe more broadly through the lens of the comment about doubling it, how should we think about future AUM or each deal adding to results over the - as they come through? Greg Johnson : Yes, I think - Good morning, Patrick. I think the way to think about the two transactions that we've announced, bearing in mind that Athena closes in February and Pennsylvania Trust closes in April, is that they'll add collectively about $0.015 to $0.02 a share to earnings. The margin is roughly in line with our margin as a Company, but we see expansion opportunities there. And you should transactions that we may be looking at are very similar to that in proportion to the size of these transactions. So I think that's the level of detail we're willing to give at this point. Patrick Davitt : And then on the commentary, should we take that you are not calling out any specific redemptions to mean that there aren't any as you have in the past couple of quarters? Jenny Johnson : There are some that we are aware of. I think there is a $1.1 billion, we just don't know when it comes in. We don't have - we don't, we're not aware of any specific dates this quarter that any episodic redemption is coming in. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think the way to say it is that we're early in the quarter with a better net flow picture so far, and we have very little known large episodic outflows, so that's why you don't see it written into the commentary. Greg Johnson : And I would just add, I mean it - we just in the past, it's hard when you know one or two and you don't know the timing and sometimes it's better not to say anything when we release our asset levels on a regular basis. Of course, there's still going to be pressure from the VA business and just trying to get the timing sometimes is very difficult, but there is still going to be larger redemptions coming on that side, as we've talked about in the past. Operator : Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Dan Fannon : I guess just to follow up on that, I guess, could you give us the level of assets left in that VA business at this point? Matthew Nicholls : I think it's like $35 billion, but again, we'll - that's way off - I'll get back to you, but I think that's about somewhere around that number. Not all of that obviously is at risk. It's just some of the - that business, as we've said before has been under a transition from using funds to using different lower volume models and index like products and lower cost products, and we've been transitioning our business in part of our solutions and we've actually been able to retain some of those accounts by switching them into the new model. So I think that, that - we're hopeful that that can be a growth business instead of one that's been in constant decline as the traditional funds have been under pressure. Jenny Johnson : And I will confirm Greg's number. Greg Johnson : Jenny looked it up, so it's good support. Dan Fannon : And then just as a follow-up in the commentary you talked about the Income Fund, and you mentioned yield being a bigger factor for kind of investment decisions in over necessarily potentially performance, but we've seen outflows increase in the last three quarters, redemption levels growing, performance there obviously has come in. So can you talk about again just to that fund and that category and how we should think about it on a go-forward basis based on either platforms or kind of distribution partners and how they're thinking about that fund in the context of everything else? Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean I will start and just say that first and foremost, I mean, the yield is 2.5 times its category yield. So it's a very different creature, than where it's measured against. And again, most advisors appreciate that fact. So you're going to have more duration risk if rates go up like they did in that in the quarter and generally a little more credit risk than maybe the category. The other big factor, as we talked about it before is how this fund fits into the new landscape of fee-based versus the traditional brokerage model and it's less, less of an opportunity for sales in the fee-based world that's building models and we're building models as well and adapting our product lineup and solutions to meet that, but the traditional 40 Act fund of the Income Fund is under that secular pressure. So it's hard to gauge how much of it, I don't think a lot of it's really performance related, I think you still are going to be under pressure as people transition to fee based, and we do our best, and as that settles it's still always going to be attractive in the brokerage world. But there is other markets like we're just introduced in Europe in our SICAV lineup and hopefully we could gain some of what we lose in those redemptions. Jenny Johnson : And I'll just add. The category has got a decline of about 2% and we were up 4% and the Income Fund specifically gross sales were up 28%. So the strategy to Greg's point, the category is much lower yielding and so it often gets dinged in its measurement there but clients love the yield. And we think there is huge opportunity for the SMA business on that product. So it's been around 70 plus years for a reason. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Mike Carrier : We've hit on M&A a little bit and I guess just one question on that, and one follow up, just when you look at the backdrop, obviously you guys have been more active on the wealth side, but you've mentioned some product areas, distribution areas that you're more interested in. I was just curious, when you look at the competitive backdrop, whether it's pricing, how you're thinking about returns on investments whether it's in Walter Asset Management, just kind of an update on how you're thinking about just given that you're spending more time on that area and how you see that kind of playing out. Greg Johnson : So, no market cycle is perfect in terms of when you should execute inorganic transactions and this is obviously no exception, given the fact that we're at the height of the asset class prices across nearly every asset class that we're in. And that we're interested in growing. So that part is a tough one to answer. Other than the fact that we think the areas that we're looking at in particular will make us as a firm more efficient and better utilize expensive resources that we have that are very important for the future of alpha in a standalone basis and we think we can make acquisition targets more efficient and more attractive for them, and even more so it's like a multiplier effect when you put the two things together. That's point one. In terms of what we look at around metrics and hurdles and such, I would just say that we look at a number of quantitative and qualitative metrics, including how the transaction could increase the return of our current assets, which I just referred to, for example, distribution is a very important one appropriate risk rated - sorry risk adjusted discount rates precedents comps, the basic principle of achieving a return in excess of our own cost of capital. The things that you're very familiar with, we're very focused on. Frankly in a very, very simple level, you can see the size of our cash resources and turning that cash into a positive catalyst in terms of increasing our earnings and making our firm more efficient capitalizing what we see to be a pretty exciting future in many areas, notwithstanding the pressure on the industry is what we're very focused on. So it's really a combination of all of those - all those things, Mike. Greg Johnson : And I would just add that as we said before, I mean, looking at a benefit street type, when you say what, how do we look at the world and landscape, and that's a classic example of an emerging category that is passive proof and one that we think is going to grow very well and one that we think we can add value to distribution and I would say, all of those are being validated to date as we continue to bring new products out and are ready to benefit from some of those positionings in the next year or so and I think again we look at the landscape it would be more on lower cost institutional managers that we can then build into our retail relationships versus the older higher cost 40 Act type managers. We'd be more focused on that and then technology, anything we can accelerate and look at platforms for distribution that could be helpful and build globally, those are the other areas that we think could be very important to us. And then finally I'd say as we said before alternatives, real estate again passive proof of categories, private equity things like that that really build out our alternatives group and then have the specialization of distribution in those categories and have the kind of breadth that allows us to have the specialization would be where we're heading. MikeCarrier: Right, that's helpful and then just a quick follow-up maybe on the organic newer areas like the SMAs, models, multi-assets, I guess on one hand, you guys have the distribution, and you have a long track records in a lot of the products, the other hand, some of the performance challenges in the near term, a bit of a hurdle. So just want to get an update on how much maybe be traction you're seeing on that front, and do you need to some of the shorter-term performance to shift in order to see that pick up. Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean I'll let Jenny follow me, but I don't think the, you know the challenges of we have because of our asset mix and styles of the Templeton with the value discipline in a mutual with the value discipline doesn't mean that your solutions business and your SMA business can't be successful and they are not required to put those in the portfolios, if they think that that style is not appropriate in this cycle. So I don't think it's held it back at all. We've been very successful getting our models into the larger distribution platforms and are seeing some growth there today. So I don't think the performance issues of just style of value versus growth and again if you look at our growth funds and how well they are doing across the board that they certainly are solutions benefits from that today as it does our retail flows. Jenny Johnson : Yes, as Greg mentioned, you know, certain newer categories for us or where we put more resources SMAs are up as he mentioned the model portfolios, and I think we talked on the prior call about a couple of wins we've had there, assets up 45% from the same period a year ago, hitting $1 billion and good traction. Once you get in the model, you still have to go sell it through all the individual financial advisors in the firm and provide that kind of support, but we've had good traction there and then having already mentioned ETFs, we were actually the fastest growing firm with as far as the U.S. ETF issuer with assets above $1 billion last year. So these are all where we think the vehicles in which investment management is getting delivered in this new kind of fee-based model and we've got good traction in those areas. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now live. Brennan Hawken : One on the SMA, and you guys' approach there considering the expansion of that offering into the broker-sold channel. Just curious about when you think about it, what portion of your products do you think makes sense in that wrapper and whether or not you need to make further investments as those - as those assets ramp. Because obviously you've got the wholesalers into the sales effort which is clear. But it's my understanding that you need sort of trading pipes and other automated connectivity into each of those platforms, does that require any further investment, or are you guys already there. Jenny Johnson : So I would say that that is what we've been working on, as I mentioned bringing in the new head of SMAs, I think we learned a bit more about what we needed to do and I think we're in a good place today. Greg Johnson : But it's not something we've been in that business for over 20 years and so it hasn't been a big emphasis for us, but Templeton at a very focused group early on and we've been in the muni business for a long time as well than SMAs. Brennan Hawken : And the part of the question about which portion of the lineup might make sense for that wrapper because it's not all that well since you need to own the underlying securities. Jenny Johnson : Well, so the way the industries have uptick the Income Fund, right, there are securities in there that the individual client can't own on the statement and so you just do a completion mutual fund, and so we have launched a few of those. So for example, the underlying equities and bonds that are appropriate to be on the client statement would be there and then anything that the client can own individually, the advisor would allocate that to the completion fund. Brennan Hawken : And a follow-up on the trends you guys have seen here in January, certainly encouraging that the flow trends have moderated but can you help us understand why that is necessarily indicative of the best way to think about the path forward because it is just one month and when we look at the last three quarters, the redemptions seem to have accelerated each quarter and that's coincided with the deterioration in performance. So is there something specific about when the calendar flipped, that should translate into that trend proving sustainable or maybe a little more color on that would be great. Thank you. Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean I think it's hard, I think January is generally a better month, number one, December you generally have higher redemptions and that quarter tax selling and year-end and slower sales because there's a lot going on in December and January, generally is just a better month in terms of flows. You know, it's hard to gauge how much of that is tax selling and where obviously for us if you, again, it's hard to say take the global bond out of the equation, because that's been a big driver of flows both ways. But if you look at the last quarter, we had three major categories and inflows, which would have been a very positive story, if we didn't have the acceleration of $6 billion of outflows within Global Bond. So I think you're right in asking that question, where does it go. I think there was more pressure for the quarter, and as I said before things moved quickly in terms of relative short-term performance and we're already have seen some recapture and performance in the quarter to date with global bonds. So that can move quickly and we've seen it in past cycles, how quickly it went from outflows to moving back to inflows. Operator : Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Blostein : I just wanted to follow up on the - the one of the things you guys mentioned earlier regarding acquisitions to build out Fiduciary Trust and I think you said you expect to double that asset base over the next year or two. So maybe could you just spend a couple of minutes on the EBITDA multiples you're seeing the space that you're comfortable paying the competitive dynamics in the corner of the market, because I think there's a lot of businesses you would like to add scale and presence in that corner of the wealth management industry and what are the key selling points at the end of the day, is it a one-off discussions, or are there more competitor, kind of why do people decide to sell to Franklin? Jenny Johnson : Yes, I'll take that part and then let you talk about the multiples in EBITDA. You know, you're absolutely right, when you talk of these financial advisors, they're usually at a point where, as Greg mentioned are feeling that they can't continue to invest in technology when the regulation and the requirements around really adding all these wealth capabilities it because they realize they are subscale and there are a lot of buyers. The two acquisitions that we did chose us and they chose us because Fiduciary Trust has been around since the 1930s, it was set up by five high net worth families. It is really marquee ultra-high net worth business that understands multigenerational asset management and the issues that go much beyond just figuring out investment returns and so it will always be a competitive space, and it will be a space where they're looking at their clients who they know well and saying, who is going to be the best stored of these assets. And so that's what we think is our big selling point. Greg Johnson : Yes. And I think in terms of the multiple in the price in the competition for these assets, I think, Alex, what you may be referring to is the broader wealth management business, of course, we know that private equity and other wealth managers in the mass affluent wealth space are very, very active and some of the EBITDA multiples being discussed here in '15-'16 times plus area even in businesses that don't actually have the acquisitions closed yet, for example. So it is a very highly competitive space from a rollout perspective because the economics just make so much sense. In this area that we're focused on with the multiples, a little bit lower. I'd say so, say in the low double-digits to ten times to low-double digits area and that becomes more efficient for us upon the connection collaboration and to a certain degree integration with Fiduciary Trust that becomes very economically compelling to us and as Jenny mentioned the reason for us versus others is there are really a very small handful of very focused pure ultra-high net worth wealth managers, the services that you need to provide are very expensive to invest in and to retain and to have the right team to provide it. And I'd say they're very specialized across the whole slew of different advisory solutions, if you will for sophisticated ultra-high net worth folks. So that's why we think we're a good home, just as Jenny mentioned we've become a sort of coming together of both sides. Not as necessarily going out and scouring the ground. We're also finding that upon the announcement in these transactions and news getting out of our interest through Fiduciary Trust, that there are more than we actually thought in the marketplace and there are several very important dates in the U.S. that contain other sorts of firms in the $3 billion to $6 billion, $7 billion AUM area that will also be a very good fit for Fiduciary Trust in our strategy. Alex Blostein : My follow-up question was just a quick one around expenses. I apologize, you mentioned it earlier, but if you look at the guidance, I think you're guiding to a down 2.5% expense growth for fiscal 2020 versus '19. I just want to confirm that's for the total expense base of about $2.4 billion last year and that's inclusive obviously of the deals that you announced. So there is going to be a little bit of revenue that's going to come through with that as well. So maybe just kind of confirm the expense number for this year and help us think about the revenue contribution for this year from the deals that you are planning to close. Thanks. Greg Johnson : I'd confirm that on the expense side. And I would also confirm that, that guidance is inclusive of the transactions that we've just announced. We're not going to separate out the revenue yet until that becomes a larger line item, but our guidance generally speaking on the expenses consistent where we expect revenue to be also. So we - as we have done this quarter and the same with last quarter. Our objective is to do our very best to have positive operating leverage in the business and I would say that would be our guidance for 2020. So our guidance of 2% to 2.5% perhaps even a little bit more expense reduction based off 2019 that you referred to, Alex, so I would say that on the revenue side, we'd hope to be better than that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live. Robert Lee : This may be more of a philosophical question. But if I think of the growing the high - ultra high net worth business, I think some of the investments you're making in various platforms. Is there a desire or need here to try to get closer to the end asset owner? I mean one of the challenges for the industry broadly has always been there is someone between you and the ultimate owner of the asset. So you think that that's an important part of kind of your strategy, you're trying to get closer to who actually owns the asset and pulls a trigger? Jenny Johnson : Yes. So I mean we are still big believers in end financial advisor providing advice. We are not believers that the robo advisor is going to, and the machine is going to, in the end intermediate that Financial Advisor. You know these things like robo advisors, we think is more akin to a TurboTax which was going to put all CPAs out of business and now the CPAs are the big users of TurboTax. So the key for us is what kind of as the advisor adds more wealth management capabilities what platforms can we invest in to get closer to that end advisor to be able to influence and help them be better at their business and so as we think about our investments on the technology side, it can be things like financial planning or other kind of tools that the advisor is expanding beyond just investment capabilities. Robert Lee : And maybe just a quick follow-up, I mean there's clearly a lot of discussion on M&A on the call, but maybe this is a question, just to confirm what you're not interested. And I assume you're continuing to not be interested in any kind of scale driven merger. Greg Johnson : I don't think that's accurate to be frank. We don't want you seem like we are looking at every single thing on the planet there, as I've said in - or as we said on previous calls, we're out there, very few transactions that contain an element of scale in it, that would make sense for us, but there's certainly other those that contain that. And that is on our shortlist. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I think the point is that we would never be first on the list of combining something for the sake of cost cutting and scale. We may get that secondarily as a benefit out of it, but it's really about bringing in areas that complement the firm in areas that we believe are going to be strong areas of growth in the future, but that certainly doesn't eliminate the benefit of certainly distribution and scale and things you can get out of that. Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean we could, for example, consolidate an operation in the U.S., but remembering that what that business may contain would be applicable to many countries overseas that we're in that perhaps that party is not in. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Michael Cyprys : Maybe just following on the Fiduciary Trust build out, hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the strategy there and talk about what you're looking for in firms that you might acquire and maybe you could talk a little about your process there. How you sift through and identify and prioritize and what your ultimate vision here is. Jenny Johnson : I'll let Matt handle the - how do we sift through. Again there are financial advisors that are - that are almost family offices or really wealth managers that have done very, very well up until now. And the regulatory environment and the demands on services have increased. And, you know they're looking at their business and they're thinking, I want to add more things, but it's just difficult to scale this. And so, they're looking for home with a firm that understands the wealth business, and the ultra-high net worth business is about investment returns, it's about trust and the state planning, it's about tax efficiency and it's about education in the next generation of wealth. And the wealthier and the older you get, the next generation education becomes the most important part of that. And so if they're looking at their clients, they want to make sure that they're connecting with the firm that can provide longevity and also has that same core culture of understanding what it takes to really manage for a high net worth family, and not all the roll-ups that are happening out there meshing both the ultra-high net worth with mass affluent and that becomes a danger of diluting kind of a capability that you provide for the ultra-high net worth. Matt, I don't know if you want to talk about? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I mean, and look, we have, as I mentioned a moment ago to Alex's question, we have financial discipline around these things. So obviously we want to make sure that it's going to work financially for us upfront in terms of the multiple, and then there's various earn-out structures and performance targets that we have against the business. I think that the - where that base location is very important in terms of limiting disruption obviously as always, very important, the point Jenny made around diluting the last thing we want to do is dilute the specialized nature of what Fiduciary Trust does and frankly the targets that we - or the partners of future companies that we could own that's exactly how they feel as well. They don't want to - what they do to be diluted in any way by what we do. So when we're having these discussions, it's really a coming to a mutual understanding very rapidly that what we're trying to achieve is the same goal ultimately. So, the summary is, we're financially disciplined, obviously, it needs to make sense for us a very good use of our cash and it's a very good use of an asset sort of pretty frankly being a little bit under-appreciated in the overall scheme of things, Fiduciary Trust, so. Michael Cyprys : And just as a follow-up maybe on the ETF side, I was hoping you could elaborate on the ETF strategy I think about $7 billion in AUM is where you are today. But just curious as well around that what the interest or appetite there is to scale that may be in a more quickly more material way through inorganic means and what scenario could that makes sense for maybe you add some other geographic regions and more strategies around that? Jenny Johnson : So we're - we launched in U.S., Canada and Europe and looking at Asia, we are quite happy with our growth. We were one of the first multi-factor smart beta issuers and actually that's the biggest group of assets. The second is our active ETFs and the third is our passive which are the cheapest actually passive in the category that they're in. And the challenge with ETFs is, you always have to get scale to be able to attract the institutions. And so, we're starting to see more and more flows there every day and I think that it probably if the right opportunity came up, we'd certainly entertain it, but at this point the - we're focused on just, we have a great team, and the growth there. Greg Johnson : And I would just add, I mean it as you know, I mean like anytime you get in a new business, it takes a few years, the big distributors wait and I think we're at that critical point where we've been out good performance in many of the ETFs and getting on all of pretty much all of the platforms now. So I think that's the big change of where we are in the cycle. So we're optimistic that that can that will really accelerate growth. Jenny Johnson : And from a scale, for example, we are, I think it's launching this month, three somatic ETFs that are the Franklin genomic, the disruptive commerce and intelligent machines and we're basically leveraging the team that runs our Dynetek fund to be able to provide those because there was feedback from clients in that they wanted some specialized type products that - somatic products, so you're able to scale existing teams that are historically have been doing traditional mutual funds. Operator : Our next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is now live. Glenn Schorr : Just one follow-up to your comments earlier on Benefit Street and one micro one macro. At the micro level, I'm just curious if you could update us on anything related to performance, new products and distribution penetration that you've seen, now that they're part of the family, and then at the higher level, curious how you're thinking about addressing other private asset classes across PE real estate infrastructure and things like that. Thanks. Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean, I'll just start with the BSP and I think as we said before, it's not something you just plug and expect to see flows on the retail side, it's a complex, more complex product set up and we set up interval funds for the retail, for retail distribution in both the U.S. and in Europe. And we've also this year are planning on having a BDC offering with one of the major distributors here in the summer and all of these are going to be meaningful in terms of flows this year. So I think we're very pleased with performance, with the pace and how we've gotten our distribution kind of lined up behind it. And it's - it is a more complex sale that we've learned, but we've done a lot of training and continue to be very optimistic there. I think the difficulty when you say the tactics around the other asset classes, it's very hard to go out and just buy, as you know buy real estate or buy private equity and so it's performance, fee driven, its partnership driven and you've got to find the right combination of incentives to make that work. So it's not always easy to do that. And I'll let Matt if you want to add. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, just got a couple of other points on Benefit Street. First of all, in terms of their revenue contribution for the quarter was up 8% from last quarter to $53 million that was largely due to performance fees, but still its increased contribution. I think the second thing is the team the Benefit Street is providing tremendous leverage for us at Franklin in terms of our overall strategy for alternative asset managers, they're all very experienced spending time with the other asset classes with the new alternative arena, including frankly spending time considering smaller specialized acquisition targets in that area both domestically in the U.S. and internationally. So we get - there's multiple other benefits to owning Benefit Street away from just the organic sort of activity we have going on which we are enthusiastic about the future. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Brian Bedell : Thanks for taking my follow-up. My question on the ETF in organic was already answered, but maybe if I could just add a couple of things. Maybe your view on the active semitransparent ETFs, is that something that you think you would like to develop and leverage some of your better performing track records? And then also I think you mentioned geographies, you'd like to expand in terms of the M&A strategy. Is that more distribution-oriented or is it more product-oriented? A \u2013 Greg Johnson : On the latter one, I'll start and Jenny would go the ETF one. On the latter one, it's a combination of both, depends on what market if it's more of the emerging markets, it's really distribution driven. In certain other local markets as you know, we have a local asset management business in several markets sometimes can be beyond distribution. And in certain cases it's just, we have a very good operational group, if you will, based in certain of these countries and we can be much more scaled with the same amount of head count. So we're very focused on certain key countries and growing those countries, that's what we mean by that. Jenny Johnson : And the non-transparent ETF vehicles that have been approved they're really U.S. equity. So you are limited. And we certainly talked about it, and at the point where we feel that a particular product requires non-transparent, we will absolutely entertain it, as I mentioned in rolling out these three Dynetek funds we felt comfortable that we didn't need non-transparent on those. And in the fixed income ones that we've rolled out. So far, we haven't felt the need for it, but it is not something that we are averse to if it makes sense for particular product. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Greg Johnson : Well, thank you everyone for attending our call and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factors of MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' President and CEO, Jenny Johnson. Ms. Johnson, you may begin. Jennifer Johnson : Hello, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's second quarter fiscal results. Significant events have unfolded in our world and at our company since we held our first quarter earnings conference call back in January. To start, this is my first official earnings conference call as President and CEO. With each new day, I continue to be filled with excitement and gratitude for the opportunity and promise that the future holds for our industry and for our business. Today, I'm joined by Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. We hope that everyone on this call and your love ones are staying safe and healthy. As an organization, our top priority is on the health and well-being of our employees and their families. We're extremely proud of and grateful for how resilient they've been under these difficult conditions and their ongoing efforts to keep the business running efficiently while maintaining our strong focus on our clients. With respect to business priorities, amidst the recent market volatility, security selection is more critical than ever. We like to say that today's market dislocations are tomorrow's alpha. And I've had a number of encouraging conversations with our investment teams, who are finding compelling opportunities that result from the sharply increased volatility. It's also encouraging to note that over the recent volatile period, our strategies are producing strong results. For the period from February 20 through March 31, which is the time frame which reflects the sharpest market volatility during the quarter, approximately 2/3 of our U.S.-listed mutual funds and ETFs were in the top two quartiles of their respective Morningstar categories, and more than half of those were in the first quartile. Performance across many of our investment strategies has been strong in such areas as U.S. equity, municipal bonds, global macro and global equity, among others. Our funds continued to outperform through April. Our acquisition of Legg Mason remains on target to close in the third quarter - third calendar quarter, and integration plans are well underway. We continue to see the long-term value of these combined franchises and that our strategy to diversify and create new opportunities is the right one. Additionally, our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with tremendous flexibility to evolve our business. I remain more confident than ever that as an organization, we have the talent, discipline and foresight to continue our long-term success while helping our clients achieve their financial goals. Now I'd like to open it up to your questions. Operator? Operator : Our first questions come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks good morning, everyone. Hope you're all staying healthy. In the merger agreement with Legg Mason, there's a criteria of 25% net outflows are client consent. I just wanted more color on this constraint. And can you confirm that net client outflows at Legg Mason would need to exceed this level before the transaction closes in order for Franklin to elect not to pursue the transaction? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. I'm going to have Matt Nicholls answer that. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Craig, that's correct. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And is there any AUM level for Legg Mason where you would consider not to pursue the transaction just given that it's an all cash transaction? Jennifer Johnson : No. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Okay. With those answers, that's a good lead into this question then. So let's talk about what you can do prior to closing and what you have to wait for after closing. And I'm specifically interested in things like fund consolidation opportunities across fixed income and how you lever their global distribution platform. Jennifer Johnson : So our focus pre close, as we've said, is really on integration of holding companies and integration of distribution. So - and really leaving the affiliates alone, which means that we're not focused on fund consolidation. Having said that, there's very little overlap in our products. As we said, this was really about filling in product gaps. And so there's very little overlap anyway. But that's where our area of focus is. Matthew Nicholls : I think just to add to that, there's various countries that we have presence where Legg Mason does not have presence. So we're focused on those too, in terms of potential growth. Distribution, as we talked about extensively on various calls, is a key area. And obviously, the operational side of things at the holding company is a big focus in terms of the planning efforts. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Outflows continue to be quite high, almost interesting that even with the coronavirus impact on the market, they didn't get too much higher from where they were in the December quarter. But with market conditions recovering now off the bottom, can you just walk through what you see as the path back to net flows for Franklin? Clearly, with the Legg Mason acquisition, there's a lot that you're doing on the sales side, but maybe give us the path through, both on distribution and product, to get back to a positive sales position. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So a couple of things on there. The - just within our own firm, you look - our April numbers, we've been improving consistently until we sort of hit a bump here in March. And I would say that our April numbers are back to where that improvement was. So that was first thing. Second of all, of course, flows follow performance. And as we mentioned, we've had almost 70% of our assets or our funds performing in the top tier quartiles in that - this period of volatility. And that's carried through. So you take like the global bond. Global Bond Fund has outperformed its nontraditional bond peer category at Morningstar by 4.4% and its prior category of world bond by 3%. So it's markets like this with the volatility where active managers get to show outperformance. And as you have outperformance, the flows will follow. And then as we've talked about, we've invested a lot in distribution. We've seen good progress on things like SMA. Our ETFs have been in net inflows, and our U.S. equity is now just getting, honestly, the due that it's deserved as far as the recognition that it's deserved around its outperformance. And so we've seen good positive flows there. Greg, you want to add anything? Gregory Johnson : I would just add that I think Jenny mentioned some of the short-term numbers. And certainly, Templeton's one in that category as well that we're seeing some relative performance during the downturn. I think munis, we're seeing strength there. We've had very good performance on the muni side. And Benefit Street, which is ideally situated and has put a lot of capital to work in these down markets, we're seeing strong interest in the year ahead in flows there. I mean the big category killers for us are the global bond, as Jenny mentioned, and we're really out there telling everyone about the defensive nature with all the uncertainty in the market, how it can lower risk in a portfolio. And I think we're getting a reception of that as people's risk concerns and awareness is heightened. And the income fund, while it's lagging performance-wise, it's not unexpected. And as we've said before, it's 2 times its industry as far as its dividend payout. So it's been under pressure more with high yield just generally to its counterpart. So if high yield holds in there in this market, that should continue. So I think the income fund and Global Bond Fund are the ones that we'd like to see a leveling off. And hopefully, we're starting to see that, but I think we've got some other areas that we are seeing strong interest and strong performance. Jennifer Johnson : Sorry. Let me just add a couple other things. As Greg pointed out on munis, so I just want to say, you heard a lot of noise on munis because of the levered munis in the market. We didn't have levered munis. We had already moved to higher quality, which is actually, as there's been dislocations in the muni market, has enabled us to raise and really gain some opportunities there. And I think as you hear states talking about bankruptcy and others, there's been no time like the present for a true solid credit team on the municipal bond area, that will really differentiate. So we're excited about that. And then as Greg mentioned, BSP. BSP has raised $1.3 billion in this window, including just under $1 billion for their private debt and special situations fund. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. And as we're quite far into - well, we're basically at month end, just today there. We can say that we expect to end the month at just over $600 billion under management. And the flow picture will look quite similar to February, maybe a little bit more elevated than February, but very close to that. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Matthew, maybe if you could talk about the expense outlook for the remainder of this year at your core - within Franklin and some of the levers that you're looking to either address kind of the lower AUM levels, given what's happened, and how we should think about flexibility from here. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Dan. I mean, hopefully, as you've seen in the quarter, we've continued to display quite disciplined expense management. It's really hard, as I think everybody can appreciate, to guide based on the current unique circumstances that we're all facing. But our previous guidance of 2% to 2.5% down for the year based - using 2019 as a base of non-S&D expenses, I'd say that we can certainly double that, for sure. And we'll probably go a little bit deeper than that, is all we'd say for now. So it's probably between 5% and 7% down versus 2019. Dan Fannon : Great. That's helpful. And just back to the kind of more recent trends on flows. Just curious about gross sales versus gross redemptions in terms of where that rate of change is coming. And also within U.S. equity, you did have a good gross sales period in the March quarter. Could you talk about which funds are seeing that success? Jennifer Johnson : So we had a couple of large institutional wins in March, which accounted for, I think, about $2 billion of that. And it was in the multi-asset and advisory and K2's strategy. We're getting - the inflows in the U.S. equity have been very strong. The fixed income has been - Franklin fixed income is actually in the - Tax-Free has been picking up. They had large redemptions as others, but the performance has been very, very good. Gregory Johnson : Yes. And I just - I mean, I think particular funds in the U.S. equity side, our DynaTech Fund just has a lot of momentum. It's now about $10 billion in size from a relatively small base and had $775 million in net flows for the quarter, which was up from $400 million. We're excited about our new Innovation fund, which we just kicked off and has five stars, and kind of leveraging that style. And then in our SICAV base, the U.S. Opportunities Fund continues to have strong performance and strong flows as well. So that group has really done extremely well and, obviously, a market where technology, even in this downturn, has continued to do extremely well. Matthew Nicholls : That benefits [indiscernible] Jennifer Johnson : And BSP, yes. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : I hope everyone's okay. Maybe just staying on the expense discussion for a moment, Matt. Of that 5% to 7% plus drop year-on-year, how much of that is permanent versus potentially some delay to the extent the revenue backdrop would improve that might sort of turn on some reinvestment perhaps? Matthew Nicholls : Well, I hope the comp isn't permanent because we hope for improvement in comp as the firm continues to evolve and grow again. I think you could look at the IS&T part as being pretty permanent. We're being very disciplined around ensuring that comes in at - in the high 50s, low 60s million per quarter. So that we're pretty confident. And that includes investing in certain areas of technology. So that 6% to 7% lower in IS&T for 2020 includes shifting of projects, reprioritization, being able to invest and lowering costs. I'd say parts of G&A, which we expect to be about 10% lower for the year, is also permanent. Obviously, going through this period, there's exceptionally low T&E by definition because nobody's traveling. So we could expect that to come back up. But still, for the year, we'd expect that to be down 10%. And excluding one-off items like impairments and things, of which some comes under G&A, we'd expect that to stay at that level in a disciplined way. And, again, this is just Franklin in stand-alone. Of course, we can't talk about what this - what it would look like with Legg Mason at this point in time. And then the occupancy expense, I think I've talked about this before, it's gone up a little bit as we've repositioned parts of our real estate here and built more real estate. But then, at the same time, we're offsetting that by leasing parts of our owned real estate to tenants that are still paying us. So that's how I'd sort of present that, Bill. So comp or benefits, obviously, will remain variable. But the other expenses that we've - other expense adjustments that we've made across IS&T and G&A are the more permanent ones. Bill Katz : Excellent. And then just two follow-ups. Just in terms of the deal, can you sort of walk us through where we are now in terms of incremental milestones between now and completion? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So we have - I'd say we have two critical work streams going on where we can't operate as one company, as you know, between signing and closing. But we have work streams around planning, so that we're ready for closing. And we're not closing until September 1. So we - approximately September 1. So we have a good amount of time to get ready. The two major work streams is, one, the holding company functions. We obviously don't need two holding companies. We only need one. So we're working on what that would look like and planning for what that - what the result of that will be. And then the second one is around the LMGD and what we - which is Legg Mason Distribution Group, at the holding company level, which is really retail distribution for the most part. As you know, with the affiliates, that's - they have their own institutional distribution. And our global advisory services, which is our much larger distribution marketing product area. So there are strategic and planning streams going on in both of those. And I'd say that Jenny should talk more about the distribution side. But on the holding company function side, we feel quite organized. We'll probably be ready at least a month before closing in terms of how we're going to do things going forward. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. And I would just add that the other piece of this is there's a lot of regulatory approvals that have to go in the process. And we are on path. Those are on schedule, and we're getting - we've already gotten several approvals that have been required. As far as the distribution, the distribution world at Franklin Templeton is going to have to look different when you think about all the underlying brands that we will have. And so not only are we ensuring that we get the best of from both organizations, but that we structure it in a way that supports what will be this new organization. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. And we're very focused, Bill. As I think we described very clearly in this business, we know the importance of stability and continuity and with the client distributors in particular. So we're extremely focused on that. But at the same time, we're extremely focused on the cost structure of the combined company and making sure that we delivered exactly what we said we were going to do. Gregory Johnson : And I would just make a general statement, I think, just observing through this COVID period, the amount of work that's been done, leveraging technology and really getting messaging out to clients and advisers in a very efficient way. And I think that, that behavior could change and lead to efficiencies and distribution as well, as advisers are really getting used to - getting information quickly and leveraging technology from the portfolio managers directly. Jennifer Johnson : That's right. I mean we've had over 20,000 clients attending webinars, I mean, virtual conferences. And just as Greg said, one, they're much more receptive to it. And they're actually starting to like it because they recognize the efficiency of being able to get the information quickly. Bill Katz : Great. And just one final question. Just in terms of qualifying, it looks like February, can you talk a little bit about maybe, at the product level, where you're seeing it? Because as I look back to some work we had done in February, it looked like it was pretty broad-based outflow. So just trying to get a sense of, is it just a slowing in redemptions? Because it sounds like the gross sales may peter off a little bit from some of the unique stuff in this particular quarter. Just trying to get my hands around the ins and outs a little bit better. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. I would say that the gross sales are more like the February number and essentially March, too, if you took out the two big institutional wins. And then the - what's happened is redemptions have reduced significantly. Gregory Johnson : And I guess - it's interesting. I mean what always happens in periods of volatility, too, you get spikes in sales and spikes in redemptions as people are trying to take advantage, and others are just saying, I've got to get out. And that - so you saw that kind of in March in a lot of categories. And now you're getting down to probably where it's settling. And people are kind of assessing what's going on. So you're seeing a slowdown in redemptions and a slowdown in sales, I would say, generally. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. But one way of looking at it, Bill, is that the net flow picture for March is going to be one third of the - sorry, net flow picture for April is about one third of March. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : I hope everyone's safe and well also. Maybe just staying along the lines of the Legg deal. If you can talk a little bit about conversations that you're having with your institutional clients and gatekeepers and the distribution channels. And I'm not sure if you can talk about conversations that Legg is having with its distribution partners and affiliates yet, given you haven't closed the deal, but maybe just to get a sense of what your distribution partners are thinking about, the impact of the deal and whether there's any additional sort of handholding with the clients in regard to that. And then also along those lines, does the fact that just the market downturn with COVID-19, does that change your thoughts about product rationalization or reaching for more synergies? Or do you really just view it as this will sort of even out over the long term anyway? Jennifer Johnson : So I'd say that the first conversations with institutional clients is that the institutions set up calls independently with Legg and Franklin to make sure we had the same story. So - and the good news is the feedback was, wow. You guys are absolutely consistent in your story. Second point of feedback was that there was - it was actually anywhere from neutral to positive because there was certainty around ownership for the affiliates at Legg Mason. And they saw the Franklin's kind of long-term approach to things as being positive, and that there would be certainty around that. And then the third, the fact that Franklin has a record of acquiring and leaving the independent investment teams in place really fit to how Legg Mason has approached things and how the affiliates wanted to work. And so it was a demonstrated record around that. So they had a lot of confidence in the - that we wouldn't go in and muddle with the investment teams and the investment process. And so I would say that, overall, that it has been anywhere from neutral to positive. Matt, do you want to take those last... Matthew Nicholls : Yes. In terms of the synergy part, Brian, I'd say that when we announced the transaction, we talked about a gross synergy number and a net synergy number. The net was following about $100 million investment. Of course, we don't need to make that $100 million of investment right away. We can do that over a longer period of time. And in these market conditions, you can expect that we will do that, and we will be extremely focused on the gross synergy number. So that's one - point one, and that was $300 million. The two - the second point I would make is that, I think, as we all know, there is a portion of an asset management company's expense base that is just fixed to make sure that you retain the right people and the team, to make sure you're investing in the business for the future and making sure you're positioned appropriately across the board in the various parts of the company, both operations and front-office and so on. When you go through a market like this, which is exceptional, the - exceptionally bad, I would say, for the industry. The - it means when you look at our combined company, our ability to be able to control costs across a broader base is we have more leverage, basically. So there's a single - two single companies, you have that fixed base. And there's only so much you can do together. We probably will have more levers to pull in the event that we have a sustained market downshift back to where we were in mid-March, for example. And that's how we think about it from a risk management perspective. We have to be prepared for - obviously, we hope for good times, but we also want to be ready for very difficult times in our industry and our company. Jennifer Johnson : Greg, did you want to add anything to that? Gregory Johnson : And I would just add from - as Jenny said, the distribution platform is something we're looking at and working on. And we have engaged outside consultants and that are interacting with intermediaries, advisers, gatekeepers and trying to get their view of what the ideal servicing model is. And I think the beauty of this, putting these two together, is that we have that flexibility to go to what we think will be a better and more efficient distribution platform. But we want to do it through an unbiased eye, and that's really what the consultants are driving through our client size. Jennifer Johnson : And so I'd just kind of summarize that. When we announced this deal, I think that the market was pleased with the strategic nature of it in filling in the product gaps, diversifying our client base, adding scale in major markets. And I think the concern was, will there be outflows as other deals have seen? And again, because there was very little product overlap, we felt that, that was less of a concern here. I think that the initial conversations with the institutions and the consultants has been positive. So again, while it's still early days, we actually feel like that concern is unwarranted. Brian Bedell : That's very helpful. And then if I could just confirm on the base of expenses, Matt, that you've talked about for the down 5% to 7%. Is that $2.4 billion for fiscal 2019? Is that the right number to be basing that off of? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Yes. I mean, it would be about the same on the adjusted as well. It's not too far off on that. It's maybe a little bit more on the adjusted. And as you know, on the adjusted number, that's what we have more control over versus what the business needs to do in terms of paying for third-party distribution services. Yes, we're going to have on this topic of non GAAP financials, we're going to have separate calls with each of the analysts to make sure that we address all the questions for your models. So if that's what you're trying to get at as well, Brian. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Mike Carrier : First, just on the performance. You mentioned some of the areas across equities and munis that improved, which is good to see. Just in some of the areas that are more macro exposed, whether it's through credit, currencies and energy, like global macro and Income series, I'm just curious on how they've been sort of thinking about the environment or repositioning. So the global macro, they've been using some of that higher level of cash to take advantage of opportunities, and then same thing with income series, just how they're thinking about energy ahead in this environment? Gregory Johnson : Yes. I mean, I would say, just in general, global macro is still very defensively positioned for the market. And you're correct. I mean, they have a higher cash position. I think that the changes there, we continue to be underweighted towards emerging market currencies. We've taken off the kind of negative duration bet over the last quarter or so. Mutual series is really still a very - a deep value group. We didn't talk about that much, but continues to lag certainly the S&P in line with other deep value managers. But as you know, that's been the sector that unlike most cycles, where you have these big downturns, and value outperforms growth, in this case, with the unusual nature of COVID and everything, the stocks - the best-performing areas around technology have gotten stronger. And the more traditional cyclical value, energy, all these other financials with negative rates continue to be under pressure. And that's really what has continued to be a drag on mutual and will continue to be difficult on the flow side. I would say, in general, we were reducing our energy exposure across the entire organization as the macro view had a negative view of prices. But with... Mike Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Matt, just a quick one on buybacks. So moderated, as expected, in your prior comments, you've pivoted more of a focus on investing in areas of growth ahead. But just given the market backdrop and impact on the stock price, has anything changed in the near term in terms of capital priorities? Matthew Nicholls : No, I think you said it exactly right, Mike. As you know, we're a conservative company when it comes to capital management. And while we think our - just to be very clear, we think our equity price is very, very attractive, it's just prudent for us to make sure that we face this market with - in a way that's very balanced. And in our view, we've obviously just earmarked a big portion of our cash to acquire a company to position ourselves for the future. So we've got that. We have repurchased some shares, and we will repurchase shares to hedge our employee grants and other grants around our stock. But aside from that, our plan now is to sort of take a step back from it. And other than completely opportunistic repurchases, we don't intend to use our capital to repurchase shares until after the Legg Mason transaction closes. And - but the - just to complete the capital management with dividends. We keep where they are, as you know we're pretty - a sacrament to us. We want to continue to pay out dividend. Answered the question of share repurchase. In terms of the other capital management, we - you can expect to see very little in terms of other strategic inorganic purchases from the company because we've got several transactions to digest. We have the wealth management deals, which are already going quite well. And obviously, we have Legg Mason, and we've got some distribution things that we've been doing. So we're really done for now in terms of inorganic use of capital. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Robert Lee : Great. I hope everyone and their families are feeling well. Most of my questions were asked. Just two quick ones. Maybe on the sales front and the activity, maybe the improvement so far in Q2, could you maybe give us some regional perspective on that? I mean it'd be interesting to see kind of how you're seeing like APAC versus EMEA, maybe versus the U.S., or kind of the differences? Jennifer Johnson : And that's - our strongest area of improved performance has been around the U.S. retail side. But we do have some strength in some of the APAC regions. Australia was a big improvement. That's actually where that large institutional win. Malaysia, Korea. So we do have some strength in some of the APAC region as well. Robert Lee : Great. And Matt, just to make sure I heard it correctly, were you suggesting that between now and deal closing, that - going to pretty much refrain from repurchases the next couple of quarters? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, other than very modest repurchase to hedge employee grants and things. But yes, we expect to - that's going to be very minimal. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Mike Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Mike Cyprys : I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how your sales and wholesaling teams are adapting to this current environment that we're in, work from home, wholesaling function arguably not quite set up for this sort of backdrop. Maybe just what are some of the techniques and changes you guys are putting forth? And how might the wholesaling function evolve and look on the other side of this crisis? Jennifer Johnson : So first of all, as a firm, because we've been - we operate in 35 countries. We have over 100 offices. We have broad global platforms. We adopted to video conferencing at the desktop. Years ago, there isn't a meeting internally that happens without somebody being on video. And so for us, one, it was an easy transition as a firm to shift to working from home. And that includes probably 98% of our employees in India, which is where a lot of people had trouble. And so we just built this into it. So it wasn't hard for us to make that adjustment. What was - what has been actually positive is that now clients want to be interacting that way. And so the beauty is you can scale. You take a - we have - our CIOs are doing virtual conferences. I mean, they literally are doing virtual road shows, where they are scheduled one client meeting after another. They'll give up a day to a region, and the client will have a series of it - or the distribution person will have a series of advisers on those client calls. And what you're just finding is that people are much more accepting of it. And so we have, as I mentioned, we've had over 20,000 clients attending just the webinars. We have podcasts out there that have been picked up. We have a volatility center where - which actually is - our distributors have found it so good that they're highlighting it within their own virtual conferences and pushing their advisers towards it. So I think where does this go in the future? I think that you're going to see many - it's much more effective and both cost-effective, and in some ways, just from a time standpoint, it's absolutely better to do these types of calls if your clients want them that way. So I think the hybrid wholesaler is going to be much more the model of the future. It's not going to completely replace visiting people. You're just going to have a lot less in-person visits. Mike Cyprys : Great. And just as a follow-up question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the high net worth buildout. Maybe just an update there. You've done some acquisitions. How is that progressing? And just maybe an update on the overall strategy and buildout would be helpful. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So our high net worth business has been about $20 billion. And we think it's a great business for a lot of reasons. One is it's a great business in itself. It's a very sticky business, but it needs more scale. Fiduciary Trust is older than Franklin Templeton. This is a business that really is one of those core, just premier high net worth. And so we wanted to get more scale. So we - in that, when we acquired Athena and Penn Trust, it gave us two capabilities to add not just scale to the business, but specific capabilities. Athena is renowned in the U.S. for endowments and foundations for its ESG. And Penn Trust has specialty on - in - for people who have special needs children in managing those trusts for those. So not only do we get capability, but we're adding scale of adding with - that increased by 50%, the size of Fiduciary Trust's assets under management. In addition to that, as the world is moving to more fee based, advisers are getting pressured by clients to provide more of a wealth management. What was historically preserved to just really ultra-high net worth people are now being requested of financial advisers. So things like financial planning, tax efficiency, even estate planning. So having this resource within the firm allows us to be able to take some of that and be able to offer it to advisers. And just as an education, we have our - one of our heads of trust council doing a webinar for financial advisers to just talk about educating them, so they can talk to their clients about estate planning. And so these types of capabilities, we think, will build greater loyalty and, with that adviser, that growing fee-based adviser network. Matthew Nicholls : We also - we've also been very focused on the profitability of this business. That was an important prerequisite to agreeing to help build out the business through some acquisitions. And the acquisitions are certainly helping solidify the profitability story around this - around Fiduciary Trust. And even though we don't report it externally this way, we were really pleased with the last quarter of results from Fiduciary Trust, which was, I think, represented almost a record for that business. So we're quite pleased with... Jennifer Johnson : Well, actually, we've had referrals. We actually have one client that was a referral from Athena. And again, we haven't closed Penn Trust yet, and we actually have about $825 million in the pipeline that are just referrals from Athena that Athena would not have been positioned to be able to take on but the broader Fiduciary Trust can. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : I'm not sure who Travis is, but it's Alex Blostein. Matthew Nicholls : We said the same thing. We said, who's Travis? Gregory Johnson : Who's Travis? Alex Blostein : I've been called lots of things. Travis is a new one. So just another one for you guys around capital management thoughts. So understanding the approach here until the Legg deal closes, but I'm curious to get your thoughts on priorities for capital returns between buybacks and maybe deleveraging once we're through the closing of that deal. I think you're going to have a little bit of a net debt position. So just curious how quickly you are looking to kind of build that down. And then, Matthew, on your point around M&A and sort of saying you're kind of done with M&A for the foreseeable future, I think you guys talked about doubling the size of Fiduciary Trust through deals. So should we consider that that's kind of part of the deal-making that's also off the table? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So a couple of things there. First of all, on the Fiduciary Trust front. We do still intend to grow Fiduciary Trust. We already increased it by more than 50% through the actions we've taken this year. We could do a couple of smaller transactions, but that would be sort of really not material to anything we're talking about around capital management. So I don't want to completely say we're closed up. The point I was making is there won't be anything material that we're going to do around capital management involving M&A. But with Fiduciary Trust, just some smaller bolt-on type transactions in particular states, for example, that don't, frankly, move - they don't have any impact on our capital management strategy can make a real difference to how we continue to reposition and grow that business. So I wouldn't say that my comment on shutting M&A down for the foreseeable future impacts our strategy on the smaller bolt-on type transactions. In terms of the pro forma capital management view, I think it's a little bit tough one, Alex, to answer because the market's been evolving so much. As we all know, between signing and closing of this transaction that, beforehand, we announced that we're going to have a very balanced approach across M&A share repurchase, debt servicing and internal C capital allocation, for example, that type of thing. I think, obviously, if we become more leveraged than we anticipated, longer term, we will want to reduce our debt a little bit. We want to remain a high investment-grade company. I'd say our goal would be always to be less than 2 times debt-to-EBITDA out of the gate. We would be in the 1 times to 1.25 times debt to EBITDA. That's gross debt to EBITDA. As you know, there's a portion of Legg Mason's capital structure, debt capital structure, that sort of has equity content tied to it. But we look at that as just gross debt, frankly, in the company. And our intention is to make sure we have a conservative debt capital structure. We also have some levers to pull in that debt stack pretty soon after closing in 2021, where we can save $18 million to $20 million, in our view, from repositioning it, providing a situation where within probably three years, we'll have $300 million or $400 million less debt, is one way to sort of look at it. But we really have to assess our pro forma free cash flow, which should be very substantial, in particular, on a post-synergy basis. And that will open up the opportunity to repurchase more shares, invest more in terms of C capital investing, that type of thing. But I'd still stand by the M&A comment. I think our modus operandi here is to have absolute success in execution of what we've got on our plate. And, frankly, bandwidth is at the max right now. And it doesn't make any sense to be looking at other larger scale transactions. But down the line, we've made it very clear, we'd like to be bigger in wealth, and we'd like to be bigger in the alternative asset area. And that stays the same. It's just a timing matter of making sure that we're being incredibly prudent with our cash flow and our capital structure. We do not want to be net debt heavy. So as you know, at close, even with the impact on the capital structure through this crisis, on a global scale, we will be about net debt flat, maybe a little bit positive, but that's where we'd be at. Alex Blostein : Yes. Got you. My second question was around some of the recent dynamics in emerging market distribution. There's been a couple of headlines, I think, with you guys shutting down a couple of funds in India. I think that had about $3 billion to $4 billion. But curious sort of what happened there, and maybe speak to a little bit your kind of any risk that, that sort of creates for your footprint in markets like India and maybe some of the other emerging market geographies? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So we entered India 20-plus years ago. And we were a fixed income manager there, and the - or portfolio manager. In India, anything below AAA is - AAA-rated is considered non-investment grade. And the high-yield market is still very immature there. So we've had a large fund - it's actually six funds that were invested with a lot of this kind of private debt. And in October of 2019, unfortunately, SEBI came out with new guidelines saying that any investments in unlisted instruments in funds could neither be - you can't have more than 10% in a fund, and you can't trade them. So that orphaned about 1/3 of our fund there. Now, in the meantime, we managed - we had worked hard to managing laddering maturities, diversifying sectors, diversifying ownership and had been able to manage really a decline from about $7 billion to just under $4 billion. Fine. But unfortunately, with this 33%, including actually not increasing - as we've had that decline in AUM, not increasing the percentage of unlisted instruments. But it just got to the point with the pandemic, where essentially the market froze up and you had increasing redemptions. There were a couple of defaults there in India. And things like Vodafone ended up in default because the Supreme Court ruled against them. And so that created a bit of a run on the funds. And we looked at it and just decided the only way to really preserve the value for our investors was to halt any kind of subscriptions and redemptions and really go into wind-down mode. The underlying holdings, this is not a solvency issue. It's very good credits in the underlying holdings. It was really just a timing of the redemptions versus our ability to create liquidity to meet them. We were worried about the impact on our equity business there, in our high credit business.  There was initial redemptions in the high credit. We have about $2 billion in high credit and I think about $6 billion in equity. And that seems to have stabilized there. It's just very unfortunate because, obviously, as you can imagine, with India being locked down, there are people who need that liquidity. But it really was about selling those assets at a fire sale and very little buyers because of this regulation not permitting trading. Having said that, as of last night, SEBI just reversed that and is actually allowing some trading and allowing banks to hold that. So it remains to be seen how well that opens up the market so that we can return that capital to the clients. Gregory Johnson : And maybe I'll just add that - I mean one of the steps we took in that fund, and liquidity is something that we were watching carefully for a long time, was to ladder the maturities, where - so it's not - it isn't locked up, illiquid. A lot of this is in short-term debt that creates immediate liquidity for at least some redemptions as we move forward. But I think your question on the impact on the business, obviously, not good. And that's something you do as your last resort to take steps like that. And we hope to minimize the - what it will do to the brand and the equity side, which is a healthy business for us as well. But it will have an impact. Jennifer Johnson : And I would just say that the press has been very fair on this. They've actually really dug into the - and understanding the issue. I'm not sure that all of the press around the world would be as fair as India's been around the issue of the underlying credit still being good. And we have not seen a broader contagion in our emerging market business in other markets. It's really been within India. And even within India, it hasn't seemed to impact our equity business very much. Alex Blostein : Got it. So it's the $3 billion to $4 billion essentially in AUM that will go through a wind-down over the next couple of months and quarters? Matthew Nicholls : Right. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. Matthew Nicholls : Right. I mean it could be over a longer period than that. But we're waiving fees anywhere over that period of time, Alex. So you can consider it to be - from a P&L perspective, it's basically gone. We're doing everything we can for those shareholders, a, to make sure they get all their money back. That's what the strategy is. It's all about maximizing proceeds to the investors in the fund. And this is the strategy that made the most sense to do that. And as part of that, we've - we're not charging any fees on those funds anymore. And that's about - if you look at the amount that we're closing, it's about $20 million of revenue. Jennifer Johnson : Revenue, yes. Matthew Nicholls : Revenue. So that - obviously, there's expenses that will come down as a function of this. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : I just wanted to follow up on the question there from the infamous Travis on the Indian credit fund. Is that going to stay in AUM? Or will you guys wind it down? Are you guys going to move it to discontinued? Just a little bit of a more of a housekeeping question. Jennifer Johnson : You're going to stay in AUM? Matthew Nicholls : You mean just on those credit funds? Are you talking about... Brennan Hawken : Yes, just the $4 billion. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. That will be wound down. It doesn't mean that we don't have a credit business in India. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. But the question is, how are we treating it from an AUM perspective? Brennan Hawken : Yes, just about the reporting, whether or not it's a... Jennifer Johnson : Yes, however we look at them. Matthew Nicholls : I mean it will be on there. Maybe what we'll have to do is to footnote put back the... Brennan Hawken : $4 billion is... Matthew Nicholls : Because we do have the assets. So I'm not sure how you take it out only. But we'll just footnote it and say that on $3.4 billion of assets in India, we're not charging any fees. Brennan Hawken : Great. Great. Yes. Travis had that one covered like a blanket. I just wanted to - and then for my second question, given the plans that you guys have to consolidate distribution teams, how are you guys ensuring that the distribution teams - each distribution team remains engaged during this transition period? In prior deals, we've seen some distraction there. It's not surprising really. And particularly given we're going through this really extraordinary period of distraction already, how might you be adapting those communication efforts and coordination efforts? Jennifer Johnson : So I would say, first, one of the good news, and again, as we talked about, the strategic benefit of this deal, was this diversification of a client base. And so there isn't necessarily direct overlap between coverage. So that's one. And two, when we got under in things like U.S. retail, they're strong where we're weak and vice versa. So our goal is to have as little disruption on the distribution side with the frontline people, who are engaged with clients. And so that's the area that we are least looking for those kind of synergies. Having said that, the distribution leadership from both sides are very engaged in designing this and figuring out what the best approach is going forward. And so it's really trying to get the best of both. It's also one of those things where, I think, in any market, a great salesperson always has value. But this is probably a tougher market than other times to be able to walk out the door. Now we don't rely on that. There are retention mechanisms in place. And we're focused on exactly making sure that we get the message out as quickly as how we're structuring this and who will be there. But we're trying to - I think the key message is we're trying to have as little disruption on the frontline, client air facing people as we possibly can have. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean there's a fair amount that won't change at all. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. Matthew Nicholls : I mean the institutional piece will not change very much at all and just be better coordination across the firm. And from a retail distribution perspective, it's just total focus on making sure that client has input in this and we have continuity. I mean that's a key point of the stability. Operator : Questions come from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : One quick one on the India. So it sounds like away from the $4 billion, there's another $8 billion. Is that correct, Jenny, in terms of the... Jennifer Johnson : Yes, I think that's right. Yes. Patrick Davitt : Yes. Okay. Cool. And then on the fee rate, given all the moving parts towards the end of the quarter, could you kind of frame the exit fee rate into 2Q versus what you reported for 1Q? Jennifer Johnson : The exit fee rate on... Patrick Davitt : So, like what's the kind of weighted average fee rate kind of as we start 2Q relative to what it was in the first quarter? Matthew Nicholls : It's very, very consistent. So it's $55.3 million. Gregory Johnson : Exactly. Jennifer Johnson : Exactly, exactly. Matthew Nicholls : And on a non-GAAP basis, it's $50.6 million. And I think that the change versus the previous quarter was literally like 0.1 basis point going into this quarter. We don't expect - based on the changes with India and things, we don't - it doesn't have any impact on that average. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Jennifer Johnson : Well, I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to do this call, and wish everybody to remain healthy and safe in their shelter in place and not go too crazy in your shelter in place. Take care, everybody. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' President and CEO, Jenny Johnson. Ms. Johnson, you may begin. Jenny Johnson : Hello and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's Third Fiscal Quarter Results. Today, I'm joined by Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. We hope that everyone on this call and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. We're pleased to announce that our landmark acquisition of Legg Mason is expected to close this Friday, ahead of our original schedule. The strategic rationale for this powerful combination has only strengthened since we announced the acquisition in February. It will unlock growth opportunities, driven by greater scale, diversification and balance across investment strategies, distribution channels and geographies. Significant work has been completed as we near day one, including having announced the leadership teams for our corporate functions and global distribution groups. Financial markets stabilized during the quarter, with growth stocks outperforming value stocks by the widest margin on record over the past two quarters, which impacted some of our flagship funds. On the positive side, we have seen strong performance and momentum in several key asset classes, most notably in our municipal bond and U.S. equity strategies. Flow trends continued to improve across all investment objectives this quarter. Flows into U.S. equity and fixed income strategies turned positive with eight of our largest 20 funds generating positive net flows year-to-date. We continue to believe that active management will play an increasingly important role in client portfolios, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this. Additionally, our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with tremendous flexibility to evolve our business. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their significant effort to keep our business operating at the highest level to assist our clients and help them achieve their financial goals. Now I'd like to open it up for all your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. My first question, I guess, is on the updated integration targets for BEN and Legg Mason. You talked about, I guess, 40% lower integration and execution costs. I'm curious as to what's driving that. And then also just in terms of faster-than-expected synergies, how do you ensure that it's not too disruptive to the business as you're combining these entities to impact flows kind of normal course of business? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, thanks Dan. It's Matthew, I'll take that. So the latter part of the question, which is about the execution around the synergy realizations. As we outlined in the prepared remarks, we're talking about being able to realize 25% of these savings in the first 60 days, 50% by the end of the year and 85% by the end of \u2013 within 12 months of closing the transaction. We're quite confident that the two work streams that we' ve organized : one, around the holding company functions; the other around distribution, were organized in a way where, the first part, we think can execute pretty quickly. We think that about 65% to 70% of those savings can be achieved within 60 days on a run rate basis. And then the rest of it around distribution will be at a slower pace to manage exactly the risk that you talked about around client management, product and marketing coverage across all what we think of those as sort of being the front end of the business. So we're being very careful and methodical in how we execute upon that over the 12 months that we're talking about here. The other thing to mention is that the reductions on that front-end side of things are quite modest, relative to the size of this transaction, I think we indicated between 10% and 15% reduction across our combined sales business or sales group. So that, I think, is an important indicator of being quite careful how we how we manage the execution. Jenny Johnson : Well, I'll just add to that. I mean, this is \u2013 it's what makes it complicated and makes it simpler in some ways, which is the structure of Legg Mason with the independent investment teams. And so we, right out of the gate, said that we had no intention of disrupting any of that. So as long as the investment teams aren't disrupted and we're slow and methodical on the distribution, making sure that we're first and foremost focused on no impact on clients, we think that goes much smoother. If you take a transaction where you're trying to combine investment teams, that's where I think you get into a lot of trouble. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So the structure, at the end, itself helps. And I think in terms of the execution costs, that, in other words, is how much we're having to pay things like extension payments, severance payments and other sort of structural arrangements around the execution of the transaction. When we announced the transaction, we had estimated that to be about $350 million. We now think it's close to $200 million. And that's really no more complicated than based on a person-by-person, group-by-group analysis on all of the data that we now have that we didn't have at the time we made the announcement. And we're able to retain a lot more folks than we thought at lower cost than we anticipated. So that's the reason for the lower execution costs. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Davitt : Good morning, everyone. Thanks. First question on the kind of new guidance on the cash tax benefit and refinancing. First, are you planning to include the $500 million cash tax benefit in your reported adjusted EPS? And then does the combination of that tax benefit and the refinancing, had that already factored into your guidance of high 20s cash EPS accretion? Or should we consider it incremental? Matthew Nicholls : It's incremental, and it's actually below the line. So in a way, it's just the equivalent of us having more cash on our balance sheet. The way we've modeled it is in the first three years. I would say we'd probably get half of the $500 million, and I'd say 25%, 25%, 50%. And the way to think of it is that we have that additional cash where we could invest in the business, buy back shares or pay down debt. In terms of $20 million to $25 million, just to be clear, that is not delevering the capital structure, that is lower interest payments on about $750 million of debt that is quite high cost on Legg Mason's balance sheet that we intend to refinance in the first quarter or the first half, let's call it, of 2021. Patrick Davitt : Great. And that's incremental as well to the high point? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Yes, incremental. We didn't have either of those in our accretion estimates. Correct. Patrick Davitt : Great. My follow up, the outflow trend for the income fund, looks like it's starting to accelerate a bit more after the recent underperformance. I know you've talked in the past about that being more sticky given the yield focus of the investors. But do you have any updated thoughts on that potential stickiness relative to the Global Bond Fund experienced wherever \u2013 when they had similarly bad performance? Jenny Johnson : Yes. I mean, the income fund, again is always rated lower in its category because it's managed for yield as opposed to the total return. And there is retirees that just love the nature of that product, and there's not as many competitors directly in that space. But it has had some underperformance here, and it is impacting it. But we still \u2013 it's been here for 70 years because it does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is generate that stable income. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mike Carrier : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Can you first, on the expenses. Matt, you mentioned similar guidance in the 5% to 7%. Because we've shifted a little bit in terms of the adjusted, I just want to make sure, from the comparable period of what that base is. And then as you're thinking through the year, whether that's exact range and then the longer term, you've mentioned some other sort of expense initiatives. The flip side is you're also probably looking at investments in your range just given the late transaction. Just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on some of those longer-term opportunities on the expense side? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, thanks Mike. So I think the way to look at it is that the base is about $2.225 billion. So that's our non-GAAP 2019 base and 2019 full expenses. And we expect to reduce that by between $130 million and $150 million, which is between 5% and 7%. And that guidance remains exactly the same, notwithstanding the fact that we increased our comp accruals this quarter. We adjusted our comp accruals upwards to reflect the momentum in our business this quarter, and it, obviously reflects more of where we ended the quarter versus where we started the quarter. Last quarter, before that, the second quarter, we had been quite aggressive in our reductions in comp accruals, frankly, based on exactly where we were at, in very significant uncertainty across the market and in the industry. So we did what we thought was the appropriate thing to do there. And frankly, we've reversed that based on the momentum we have in the business this quarter. All other aspects of expenses are absolutely in line or below where we expect it to be, so we haven't taken the foot off the gas in terms of pressurizing those areas we think we have leverage. Of course, what's going to be a little bit complicated going into the fourth quarter is the addition of Legg Mason, and you've noticed that Legg Mason has also reduced our expenses by $100 million. So Legg Mason is reduced by $100 million, we're reducing by between $130 million and $150 million. We're doing another $300 million around the deal, so we're talking upwards of $500 million to $550 million of cost reductions on a run rate basis. It's quite substantial. However, the more we've looked at the combination, the company and what we can do without destabilizing things, we do see some additional potential saving opportunities across the operations area, finance area, all the support functions of the firm in addition to the cash tax benefit and the capital structure points that I've mentioned to you. Mike Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow up on the flows. So you saw some good strength on the U.S. equity and in the meetings that you mentioned. International, both on the equity and fixed income side, still a bit challenged. Some of that looks like it's driven by performance. I just wanted to get your thoughts on, are you starting to see any like improving trends on that front? Or is it still going to be mostly dictated by performance improvement? And then we can see some of the trajectory chain? Jenny Johnson : Well, I'd say that the \u2013 on the international side, our technology funds and just the Franklin Growth Funds are getting a lot more attention and traction. So we're seeing good uplift in sales on those strategies. We \u2013 we've seen reduced redemptions as you're seeing slightly less redemptions in things like the global macro strategies. And so overall, there's been a net sales improvement. I would say, July, we got hit with a large $1 billion redemption in institutional account and global equity. But otherwise, taking that out, you've sort of seen the same improvement in a trend in net sales. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I think, also, the point on the eight of our 20 largest funds being positive inflows is a very important one. It's just the fact for us is that we have a couple of strategies that are so large, it tends to dominate the story. But the reality is that a lot of our funds are actually doing very well. They're just smaller, but they're getting bigger and bigger incrementally. So it's making a difference. So for example, DynaTech where, only last year, we were talking about that fund. It was $7 billion \u2013 $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion. Now it's $15 billion, so it's becoming a bigger part of the story that we can tell on the flow front. Gradually, as those things get larger, and then we add Legg Masons, much larger strategies, it helps manage the story a little bit around some of the larger things that have been \u2013 they're not bad things. They're just out of favor things, which is where the performance reflects up that so \u2013 and the flow. So \u2013 but even on those larger things, the point we want \u2013 that's really important for this quarter is that the redemptions have fallen quite significantly on those things. Greg Johnson : And I would just add, the technology fund is the number three cross-border fund. And that's really a new category for us that you can see how quickly it's accelerating in flows and could pretty quickly offset some of the headwinds you have on the global equity side with the deeper value fund as well as the global bond, which are very defensively positioned. And it's really going to take a downturn in the market for those to see any kind of swing from where they are today in flows. Mike Carrier : Got it, thanks a lot. Matthew Nicholls : Thanks Mike. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. Maybe that's a good lead in. I want to do a little \u2013 ask a little more on global international bond segment. Part of it is the product of the environment, where people's preferences away from that category. And then there's some performance issues there. So maybe if you could help us differentiate between what you think is the cyclical component of people avoiding the category. And then maybe, importantly, what's the ideal backdrop for that strategy that we can anticipate a turn in client preferences? Thanks. Greg Johnson : Yes, I mean \u2013 this is Greg. And I think the backdrop, if you look at where that \u2013 the global macro strategy is really accelerated in flows was after the last crisis and having a 10-year period against equities that was the flat decade versus that product, I think, was the number one selling fund of its kind. So the backdrop is more of a risk-off environment where you can lower the risk in a portfolio. That's really how we talk about it today. Non-correlated kind of asset class that doesn't have the same kind of risk that your equities and fixed income has, and that's really how it's positioned. So I think today, when you have markets that continue to be extremely strong, and it's a risk-off environment, people really don't pay a lot of attention to the global fixed category. When things get a little shaky, you'll start to see renewed interest there. I think that's really the key. And I think today, it's an asset class where people are allocating a percentage of it to, regardless where before, it was a relatively very small asset class. Jenny Johnson : But to Greg's point, if you just look at the full categories, global bond is \u2013 that global fix is not a big flow category right now. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : I think, Glenn, \u2013 sorry, but Glenn. I think another part of your question is what portion of the flows surge or the client base of the global macro is attributed to just that risk management client base, and it's very hard to bifurcate that. But it's probably a decent foundation of the assets under management we now have in that category is because it's been so long, these are long relationships now is to do with exactly that fact. It's around risk management and having some downside protection in a market that's being quite lofty. Glenn Schorr : Great, can I ask one quickie on Benefit? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Glenn Schorr : Sorry. I thought I was being cut. Benefit Street. Just curious on how they've performed in this crazy backdrop, where they're at in some of their capital raises, what opportunities you guys see on the private credit side? Thanks. Jenny Johnson : Yes. So in the numbers for last quarter, they called about \u2013 well, they called up $500 million in capital, deployed $400 million, the other $100 million there, they have coming in. So that was in there. Then they raised actually a CLO, which won't be reflected. It closed in June but won't be reflected until July numbers of $400 million, and they have a second CLO that'll close in August, so also will show in this quarter. So that's $800 million in two CLOs. They also raised, and they're about to have a first close of $400 million in a dislocation fund. And what was somewhat unique there is a lot of that was raised by our Australia institutional team. Benefit Street had been trying, Australia is a very sophisticated market, and have been trying for a long time to break into that market and just were not able to do it. So the combination of our team with Benefit Street was just a great opportunity. In addition to that, they raised another $50 million into their senior opportunities fund, which they'll close with $700 million in commitments. Again, these are commitments. So it's dependent on the drawing of capital. But that was raised by our institutional team in Hong Kong and China, so a piece of that. So I think they've had good opportunities as people see the importance of having the \u2013 an active manager in this space and the experience they have around the distressed side. But they also had to have a write-down on some of their BDC, both because of having to take down some leverage as well as some distressed assets in it. They don't actually have an AUM write-down there. But so that was kind of their troubling part. But on the other hand, they've had really good traction on the sales and flows. Greg Johnson : I would just add that if we look at our pipeline, on the institutional side, it's our greatest opportunity, and we're still very optimistic on strong organic growth coming into the rest of the year. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ken Worthington : Hi, thanks for taking my question. You announced new leadership in distribution with the appointment of Adam Spector as Global Head. Maybe talk about what Adam's vision is for Franklin distribution for the combined companies, what his mandate may be in terms of deliverables and any changes or adjustments you envision that he'll make to comp or structure to kind of achieve his and management's longer term goals? Jenny Johnson : Well, first of all, we did \u2013 really, a global search on this position and had unbelievable candidates as people in the industry were particularly attracted to understanding the opportunities of a $1.4 trillion manager with an emphasis on the active side, and ended up picking Adam for several reasons. One is we've just been very impressed as we've worked with him with his \u2013 both his acumen on sort of business and practical business approach to things as well as his experience. And we talk to clients, and he's really been in a distribution role within Brandywine. The way we're thinking about approaching distribution is much more regional and trying to build a more agile organization. So while historically, Franklin Templeton had kept many functions, like product and marketing and even data analytics to be centralized, we are distributing that out more into the regions to provide a little bit more flexibility, and yet still have a central group for those things that'll be central. So that's kind of Adam's and our vision around how to do that. We will evaluate it, as you can imagine, bringing the Legg Mason team together and the Franklin team together, really evaluate it, how we're looking at pay for distribution and trying to figure out what the optimal approach is. And so we've been in process \u2013 and that may vary a little bit by region depending on what's appropriate. So all of that \u2013 there's been tremendous amount of work in the process leading up to Adam's announcement in really restructuring this. And of the, let's see, five real leadership positions reporting into Adam, actually, there'll be six, there will be \u2013 there are two that are Franklin Templeton, two that are Legg Mason, one that's undetermined whether it's coming from internal or external and one that will be an external hire. So we're also really excited that we've been able to bring together leadership from both organizations. And as we, over the next month or so, make announcements around that, you'll see that it's a real combination, the two organizations. Matthew Nicholls : I think one other point to make on Adam, Ken is, Adam, in addition to being highly qualified for this position, he has existing relationships across very important parts of the combined organization, including all the investment organizations that are going to become part of Franklin Templeton. And that can be \u2013 that can infuse additional efficiencies in and of itself. But relationship-wise, the fact they've worked strategically to together for so many years, and Adam's knowledge of our company has come up to speed so fast, his vision on combining these things and how we work together in a collaborative fashion across all the investment groups. It's very impressive and exciting for us to have that, being able to hit the ground running as opposed to have to worry about other integration of cultures and things. So very good. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, everyone. It was nice to see the rebound in U.S. equity flows this quarter and also strong traction in your DynaTech and technology funds. Outside of these two funds, can you talk about if you're seeing stronger underlying demand across the industry for U.S. active equity or any green shoots relative to passive just as clients are looking to navigate a less certain future here? Jenny Johnson : Yes. It's interesting, we do have some sector funds or utility fund, our U.S. \u2013 well, I guess that's fixed income, biotech. There's a couple of underlying sector funds that have performed well. And so as you're seeing kind of interest in thematic, we rolled out some thematic ETFs that are managed by Matt Moberg, who does the DynaTech fund and seeing a little bit of traction in those, although very, very early on. So again, the emphasis has tended to be in \u2013 within the Franklin group and that group has always had a lot of strong sector funds. And so to the extent that there's been good performance there, you're seeing traction. Greg Johnson : Yes. And I would just add, I mean, I think in this COVID world that the theme around technology and how many of these trends are accelerating as people work from home, use more technology that certainly from the adviser, they want to get more exposure to their clients to this sector. So you're really seeing, I think, tremendous growth on the back of, obviously, tremendous performance. And one that, as I said earlier, we're very optimistic on our positioning. And because Franklin has had such a long history in this area, right in the heart of Silicon Valley, that we think we're in a unique position to capitalize on that. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Just as my follow-up, how do you think investor allocations, and you can comment across institutional retail, which is bigger for you, will change your fixed income? Just given that we have a very low interest rate environment here, its reduced future return potential across the asset class, many of the segments are pretty close to zero. And if bond allocations do change or reduce, do you expect to see stronger demand in other segments or maybe other segments of the high-yield credit segments? And I'm thinking also the privates like when you managed over at Benefit Street? Jenny Johnson : So funny, I'm just \u2013 I'm looking at kind of a flow chart that \u2013 it tracks Morningstar's categories. And I think out of the top eight flow categories, it looks to me like seven of them are bond categories, and one is a stock category. And I \u2013 the reason I actually have the report in front of me is just one interesting data point, which is that Legg Mason has six, four or five-rated funds in the top eight categories, and we have zero rated in the four or five stars. So just bringing that combination in, this is a retail focus. I want to emphasize the benefit of what we've always said is so important strategically, which is a broad product breadth so that you always have things that are in favor with a diversified distribution channel. And so that combination of bringing in the Legg Mason with our strong retail, we think will be a real benefit. But to answer your original question about the bond flows, you definitely see, even in this low rate environment, it's an emphasis. Whether that stays there, how much was that moving when people just think that rates had come down remains to be seen. I don't know, Greg, if you want to add anything? Greg Johnson : I mean I think, one, if you look at the institutional world, it's very hard to get away from bonds and fixed income and a fiduciary that's running that. You can maybe put a little more risk on a portfolio, but you certainly can't walk away from bonds, even in a low rate environment. But I would say the bigger trend is the importance of alternatives like what BSP offers, like what Clariant has with real estate. I think all these alternative categories in a zero rate environment become very important as supplemental kind of income providers to your traditional government type security. So I think it just accelerates a lot of what's already happening on the alternative side, not being that much more important for both institutions and retail investors. Jenny Johnson : And I'll just add on munis. I mean in this COVID environment, where governments or states have had to increase their spend to support their economies internally, because that translate, I think many people think that's going to translate into higher taxes in states. And we think that, that \u2013 one is that's going to bring \u2013 continue to have demand in munis; and two is going to be all the more reason why you want an active muni manager who is selecting what those opportunities are. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Jenny. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Chris Harris : Yes, thanks. Coming back to the Legg Mason synergies. Are you guys now saying $270 million on a net basis, and that would be up from $200 million previously? Do I have that correct? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean, what we didn't want to move away from, Chris, was the notion that a portion of the savings that we create from this transaction are going to be earmarked for reinvesting in the company. That's a really important part of our statement. But obviously, since we made the statement about reinvesting $100 million back into the business, the market's changed, and there's more stress in the industry, so we're appropriately adjusting that. I'm still convinced we're going to invest the amount \u2013 that we'd invest the amount that we talked about, but we're just going to get it from other places across the organization. But in terms of looking at the $300 million gross and what portion of that will be reallocated, if you will. We thought the $270 million net was an appropriate guide. And we felt that is a minimum, so $270 million. Chris Harris : Yes. And that was going to be my follow-up. In an earlier question, you had mentioned the opportunity to maybe do more with the cost beyond what's already been identified. So maybe you can elaborate a bit on what you might have in mind. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean I don't think we want to get into the different components now because we're not even a single company yet, but it's just our feel of working through this that we'll have opportunities, both on the investment side. Obviously, there's going to be a demand for reinvesting capital into the company. But on the cost front, we've been very conservative in this transaction. We are incredibly focused on client retention. And so far, in this deal, again, we've got \u2013 we're closing on Friday, but so far, in the run-up to the transaction, we, virtually, have no redemptions as a consequence of the transaction. Maybe there's one in Asia, but it's very, very small. So we're very focused on that. But there are various projects going on around the integration of the functions, for instance, that show that there are certain things we're doing in higher cost areas that could be moved to lower cost areas. As you know, we have a big business or a big center in India and Poland, so we have potential there. And there are certain things that we may choose to outsource down the line. We announced an outsourcing last year. As you know, we're executing that. We're going to save 100 million over 10 years in that regard. So I think there'll be more of these types of things to work through. But to announce today, guidance on that, I think, wouldn't be a good idea. So \u2013 but the point we're making is we got the minimum of $270 million net. We see a good opportunity in the future. We've got other synergies on the cost side that I've mentioned already around the capital structure, around cash tax. Execution costs are going to be lower. And we think those things add up to very substantial amounts of money that can be reinvested or used to buy back shares and so on. Chris Harris : Got it. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the fee rate pressure this quarter. So curious about maybe some of the source. I think you touched on \u2013 in your prepared remarks, there was some mix, but also some waivers, which included India. But you knew about India last quarter when you gave us the expectation. So was there some incremental or additional fee waivers that maybe you hadn't expected previously? Maybe Benefit Street, we hear about COOs deferring fees on OC tests failing. So was that a contributing factor as well? Maybe if you could break that down a bit, that would be helpful. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, sure, Brennan. So of the 0.9 basis point reduction on a non-GAAP basis, that's going from \u2013 that's going down to 49.7 basis points effective fee rate. About 0.24 basis points is attributed to India, about 0.21 basis points is attributed to fee waivers, to answer your question specifically, and about 0.23 basis points is because of regional shift between EMEA and the U.S. We have some other moving \u2013 movements within the fee rates around business mix more generally, which make up the other 20% of the 0.9 basis points. But that's the \u2013 that sort of tries to break it down a little bit further for you. We don't see \u2013 obviously, things will be different when we've merged with Legg Mason, but we don't see a further change in the 0.21 to 0.25 basis points for fee waivers. India is what it is, and that won't change until we build the credit business in India with fees that can be charged, so that's sort of a mainstay. But that really gives you a little bit more compartmentalization. It wouldn't surprise us if we saw the fee rate staying where it is or even ticking up slightly in the next quarter, based on some movement around wealth management, some other things that we see coming on in the pipeline. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you for that, Matthew, that\u2019s very helpful. And that fee waiver impact, was my supposition that it might be at the Benefit Street and some of the COO fee deferrals that we're hearing about from that market. Is that related there? And is that as bad as it can get? Or is it just as bad as you suspected might get? Matthew Nicholls : I'm actually not aware of that, I will have to come back to you on that, right? Jenny Johnson : Yes, none of us are. Matthew Nicholls : We'll come back to you on that. Jenny Johnson : I haven\u2019t heard anything. Matthew Nicholls : But we haven't heard anything on that front. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. So as you look at the core business ex-Legg Mason, appreciate all the updated synergy expectations. How are you thinking about core expense growth year-on-year for 2021? Matthew Nicholls : So for 2021, you're talking about just Franklin Templeton stand-alone? Bill Katz : Correct. Matthew Nicholls : We expect expenses to be flat to our reduction, so no growth. Bill Katz : Okay. And then just going back to CLOs. You're one of the few managers who has actually offered up the ability to actually get some CLOs done in this kind of backdrop. What is it specifically that you're seeing the opportunity? Is it just the markets themselves firming? Is there some unique distribution opportunity that Benefit Street or Franklin offers? And maybe what location you're seeing those in? Jenny Johnson : So I think that these were relationships that Benefit Street had. The majority of the equity were purchased by U.S. investors and a well-known Japanese investor that purchased 100% of Class A notes. They had two new investors that came in on the CLO platform. So I'd say that this is as much about the deep relationships that Benefit Street has had. I mean it was really BSP who raised this through their team. I know that on the second CLO, it included some ESG restrictions around like controversial weapons and tobacco and things. But these were well-known relationships that they've had, but also a couple of new ones that joined. Bill Katz : Okay. And just one clarifying that you had mentioned about flows. I don't know if you're speaking specifically to the global equity footprint or overall. You had mentioned you had one sort of $1 billion mandate coming out in July. You said the rest of the business was sort of improving. Was that the global equity segment? Or was that overall to the firm? Jenny Johnson : That was \u2013 the $1 billion mandate that came out was a global equity. What I was saying is that you take out that $1 billion and you kind of see our progressively improving. The income fund did have some increased redemptions in July. But otherwise, you see the trend of improving flows. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now open. Robert Lee : Great, thanks. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is with Legg and the affiliate. Now understanding that focus is keeping all their investors, the affiliates independent, doing their thing. I'm just curious, as part of the transaction, is there any type of change in kind of the early revenue shares, particularly since we will be giving kind of retention to the bench of the affiliates and that's already changing kind of the contractual relationships at all? Matthew Nicholls : No, Rob, we don't see any change in the structure of the arrangement that we have with the specialist investment managers, as we call them, which is consistent with what we call our investment teams internally at Franklin Templeton. The revenue shares, as we described on different calls, are accretive to our company because we're eliminating the holding companies to take out those costs. It means the revenue shares make sense to us. Over time, there may be some things that are adapted based on need of these investment groups. Or a desire to uptick the collaboration across the group, but there's nothing that needs to be forced to make the coordination across the group work very effectively as we've described. Robert Lee : Great. And then as a follow-up, I'm just curious about AdvisorEngine. I know it's a tiny acquisition in the same, but you have had some of your peers also try to look and make investments in kind of financial adviser, a couple of processing platforms like the Midway affiliate. Can you maybe update us on kind of where you think you can have success there? Because I'd say my perspective tracker is kind of spotty. You have BlackRock on one end is riding it and others have taken a stand about it. And then it goes to really gain much momentum. So how do you feel like you can make this work and help drive kind of the flows? Jenny Johnson : Yes. I mean, we already, through fiduciary, have kind of a high-touch custody business for RIAs. And so part of fiduciary strategy is figuring out how to add additional tools just to that segment. And AdvisorEngine has the possibility of doing that. But also as you're having these independent RIAs, they're being pushed, as the world's gone more and more towards fee-based, to be more wealth managers. So what does that mean? It means you're not just doing investment management, clients seeing every month that they're paying you a fee, and the clients are demanding more financial planning, education for errors, tax efficiency. And so part of the other piece of AdvisorEngine actually was a CRM tool that has, I think 1,200, almost 10% of the RIA market, 1,200 RIA firms and I think 12,000 or 13,000 users that allow us to just communicate with those and build deeper relationships. Because, again, they're difficult to communicate with, in some ways, because it's a very fragmented market. So it's a tool that we can be able to support their business, gain mind share and build relationships with. And so that's how we see it. It's just one tool in the toolbox to build a deeper relationship with that growing channel. Matthew Nicholls : I think the other thing, Rob, on AdvisorEngine is to say that we were already investing millions of dollars a year in this type of area. And now what we have is a terrific team completely focused on it almost like in an entrepreneurial type way, which is tremendous for our company, for our wealth business, for our asset management business and technology investment area. And all those things combined mean that, frankly, owning AdvisorEngine has increased efficiencies for us in terms of investing in some of the future of distribution. Robert Lee : Great. And I don't know if I can add maybe one other quick follow-up on distribution. So understanding that, combined, the distributions are realigning your distribution function, trying to minimize disruption that we have seen in other transactions where distribution forces get combined and the investment team of that fund, wholesalers, marketing people whose focus \u2013 sales often fall off. One of your peers, I guess, had some technology issues around combining their distribution courses. So how do you minimize or avoid that? Or are you actually may be taking some short-term disruption in sales as to how you're thinking of that couple of quarters? Just kind of curious of your thinking. Jenny Johnson : Yes. I mean I think that's why, to Matt's point, when we were talking about capturing the synergies, the synergies much faster \u2013 we caught a much faster on the holding company side because that doesn't have the client implication. And that we're a bit slower on the distribution side because we're being very, very careful on any client-facing individuals. So that's one piece of this. And just ensuring that there \u2013 that would minimize any disruption there. And then number two, what's a little bit unique in this transaction is, again, much of the institutional sales base sits in the affiliates, and they're not part of this integration. So nothing's changed there in our specialized investment management groups. And so that's a little different than I think you see in other transactions that's unique to this. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I also think, Rob, in certain cases, we're actually adding \u2013 we're adding greater emphasis on client coverage and how we monitor that and manage it. And I think our focus on making sure that client service remains top-notch, and that the intensity of coverage and calling remains exactly where it should be. I mean the fact that we've worked through this transaction and we haven't had one in-person meeting between announcing the transaction and closing it sort of tells you what you can get done remotely. And I think our collective sales groups and sales teams incredibly energized as a function of this transaction by having more things to talk about, more connections across different relationships, it's a really powerful thing. And of course, you have distractions, but the management team was put in place really quickly, very \u2013 decisions were made quickly in that regard. And that right away helps retain the most talented people across the organization. So we hope that we're taking the right steps to minimize any disruption you're talking about. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking my question. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on expenses. So I guess, based on the revenue run rate for Franklin, stand-alone and averaging effect of the timing of the market, et cetera, and the flow trends. I mean it looks like the 2021 revenues could decline still relative to 2022. So Matthew, maybe a little more color of why would core BEN expenses be flat in that scenario or we should really take that in conjunction with opportunities on net cost savings from the transaction, potentially being above the $270 million number. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. In our modeling, we have \u2013 when we look at the momentum we have across half of our large \u2013 it's almost half, not exactly half but almost half of our strategies, of which a number have grown really quite significantly over the past 18 months alone. We think that some of these things can start better offsetting the outflows we have from our largest strategies. And then when you combine that with the fact redemptions have fallen really, frankly, quite significantly, in particular, internationally, I think, in certain places, the lowest in a decade, for example. We feel that it's appropriate that our expense \u2013 providing expense guidance for 2021 is very tough right now because of what we're going through in terms of the transaction. But to us, right now, based on what we see across the firm and the opportunities and where we think we need to pay, we think it's appropriate to say that we won't be anything worse than flat. It doesn't mean that we won't be better than that. But I think right now, we're not really in the business of giving guidance 18 months ahead or 12 months ahead, whatever, as a business. And then the $270 million, I think, as I've alluded to already, we're going to be a much larger company with a much larger cost base. But our number one focus is \u2013 sorry to keep repeating it, but it's continuity and stability of the franchise and making sure we retain as much of the business we can and then focus on the growth engines. That doesn't mean we won't be more efficient in all the functions. We're going to \u2013 we'll work very hard on that. But you have to sort of bend down a bit and see what other opportunities may exist to improve upon the $270 million. Our feeling is there's a good shot, there will be, but we're not in a position to talk about that right now so\u2026 Alex Blostein : Got it. Okay. All makes sense. So essentially predicated on maybe a little bit better revenue outlook than what maybe consensus is baking in for you guys. Okay. Matthew Nicholls : Correct. Alex Blostein : My second question, back to some of the dynamics in fixed income markets. And just building on the earlier discussion around the impact of lower interest rates. So I guess, wouldn't the low rate environment just essentially increase client sensitivity to fees, especially given the passive fixed income products out there, a fraction of what active is charging today? Are you seeing some of these pressures already showing up in client conversations today? And more importantly, I guess, how are you positioning both the legacy Franklin lineup and Legg Mason lineup to more effectively compete with lower cost options as that potentially becomes more pronounced? Jenny Johnson : So I mean one of the things I would say now, and Greg, jump in here too. To think that passive is necessarily a good way to do fixed income management, it's just \u2013 the concept of let me increase my investments to the company that's taken on more debt, that's a challenge. And so as I mentioned on the munis, to think that all states are going to be equal in their creditworthiness and that you should just apply a passive approach to that, I think, is a dangerous thing. And we see it \u2013 you look at what the COVID environment is, one of the reasons that we had shifted a bit in some of our multi-asset solutions to some of the more conservative companies is just how long does this thing go on? And who's going to be able to sustain themselves through it? And so I think probably no more \u2013 no time greater than now for an active approach to thinking about fixed income. And you're right, we're in an environment where scale's going to matter because there's going to be pressure on fees. It's going to continue to be that case. And so scale is going to be important, and you're going to have to adjust the fees. But I think there's a danger to just assuming that a passive approach to fixed income is a good thing. And Greg, do you want to\u2026 Greg Johnson : Yes. I think it's really \u2013 when we look at the logic of the Legg deal and Western standing out as, obviously, the largest and really a leader in fixed income amongst a very small peer group. And I would say the pressure on fees has been there. It's real. It will continue to be. But I think the net result, when we look out x number of years, is going to be two or three large fixed income players that may be at a lower fee rate, but a lot of the smaller ones are not going to survive under that. And what we would lose in fees, hopefully, you'd pick up in market share. And I think the flexibility we have with the broad array of capabilities between Benefit Street and others is that we have the full fixed income spectrum available. And I think you'll see more tactical allocations and flexibility to move across different categories to gain alpha in fixed income and we think we're extremely well positioned to benefit from that trend, along with unconstrained portfolios and just giving a broader mandate for the active managers. And I look at our lineup, and I think it's probably the best in the industry for that. Matthew Nicholls : And also, we have, obviously, added substantially \u2013 it doesn't completely hedge out the pressure on fees, of course, but we do have a much larger portion of higher fee, harder to commoditize assets under management now as a combined company. I think we have $125 billion roughly of alternative assets, of which are in higher fee categories. And it's important not to just think of Weston as being all low fee fixed income. Weston has some very important alternative credit businesses alongside Benefit Street and like Clarion on the real estate side. And for us, we have K2, a few other things. When you combine that group together and you think of how significant we are from an alternative asset perspective, we're getting ourselves on the map in that regard. Jenny Johnson : And actually, while expanding your question, but as Matt touched on it. I mean I think that the opportunity on Clarion in the retail channel is massive, because we've talked to some distributors. They feel that they are highly concentrated with a couple of managers. And it happens to be that Clarion also has very, very good performance because they were overweight industrials and underweight retail coming \u2013 we think, coming out of this thing. But again, that's where this combination of having a broader lineup with a real diverse distribution base is going to bring a lot of strength. And so we think that that's \u2013 that higher fee product has just tremendous opportunity, taking it through our retail channel. Alex Blostein : Okay. Thank you for all the detail there. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks, good morning folks. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things that I might have missed some of the detail on this. First of all, on the core expenses, I think that's implying $2.1 billion for Franklin stand-alone in 2020. If you can just \u2013 if you can tell me if that's right or not. And then I think, Matt, you said earlier, you talked about the retention packages being much less expensive than initially. So just, can you clarify if that was \u2013 I think you said from $350 million expectations down to around $200 million and if those are now concluded? And is that so as \u2013 I think initially, you thought it was a four to seven year vesting schedule. Can you just clarify those please? Matthew Nicholls : Okay. That's a different matter you were talking about there, Brian. So the retention mechanisms in place are not connected with the $200 million that I mentioned a moment ago. The $200 million I mentioned a moment ago is the cost of achieving the $300 million in savings. So that's the cost of the \u2013 basically, the cost of the headcount reductions, the termination payments, severance payments and other costs related to the downsizing of the company. That's what that is. The piece you're talking about, the share grants that were awarded at the time of the transaction, they remained the same number of shares. The only thing that's changed is the share price has come down a bit since we announced the transaction. We will very likely hedge that position when we have the discussion with our Board later on this year, and we talk about capital management. So that's \u2013 they are two different things, to be clear about that. In terms of the 2020 cost base, yes, that's exactly right. It may be a little bit lower than $2.1 million. Brian Bedell : $2.1 billion, yes, based on the $130 million or $150 million. And then I guess just in terms of both the cost saves and then the attrition expectation. So far, attrition has been great, like you said, very little attrition. Maybe if you could just give us some perspective on your updated thoughts on what attrition levels might be from the deal for the first year or two. And then on the cost save side, it sounds like, obviously, most of it's coming from the holding company and other overlapping operations. But are you doing anything structurally within the affiliates on the cost side? I know that was hard to do when Legg did their cost-saving program. Or is that more of a longer-term upside to the extent the affiliates want to rationalize their own internal costs? Jenny Johnson : Yes. So sorry, there's quite a lot of questions there. I apologize if I don't get them all, but let's go through. So starting the last one first. My memory works that way. So the last one first. The \u2013 as I mentioned a moment ago, to get the efficiencies, we need to get out of this transaction, we don't need the affiliates to change anything that they're doing or the investment organization. So that's somewhat \u2013 but having said that, given Franklin Templeton's capacity to provide various functions to different parts of the organization is candidly, with all respect to our friends at Legg Mason, is quite a bit larger and greater than Legg Mason's. It means that the investment groups of our overall company has quite a bit of confidence in our ability to help. So down the line, we probably will do more with the investment organizations when they're ready and when we're ready. Right now, we've got too many other things going on to worry about that, but \u2013 and there probably will be some efficiencies in there. So that is a little bit of a synergy tail, if you will. What \u2013 that's the last question. What was your other question? The other one? Brian Bedell : It was on the \u2013 your conversations with gatekeepers and your decisions have been better so far. You have updated thoughts on deal-related attrition on that Legg Mason from assets prospective? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean the deal, I think, as Jenny mentioned earlier, due to the structure of the transaction, the fact that we \u2013 there's zero changes in terms of client coverage at the at the investment organization or affiliate level, it means we have sort of a much more embedded stability in terms of client coverage and client support. So, so far, the client retention has been very high, and we're very, very focused on that. We like to believe we can continue along that \u2013 those lines. So right now, the client attrition that we've had has been very minimal in one country in Asia, with one of the investment organizations. And we hope that remains that way. So we're more focused on revenue synergies there going forward. Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Jenny Johnson : Well, I just want to, again, thank everybody for joining the call today. And again, in this time, just hope everybody is staying healthy and safe. So thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

My name is Holly and I'll be your call operator today. Please note the information presented on this conference call is preliminary.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' President and CEO, Jenny Johnson. Ms. Johnson, you may begin. Jenny Johnson : Hello, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. Today, I'm joined by Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. We hope that everyone on this call and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. This year, despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, we made significant progress in moving our business forward, including closing the Legg Mason acquisitions earlier than initially expected. We focused our efforts and investments in key areas that directly support the firm's multiyear strategic plan to maximize organic growth, execute on M&A opportunities, and position Franklin Templeton to capitalize on industry change. The results that we announced this morning reflect a full quarter and fiscal year of Franklin Templeton, but only include two months of the newly combined organization. In that short amount of time and under these extraordinary works from home conditions, we've made remarkable progress becoming one company all ahead of schedule. And the strategic rationale for this powerful combination has only strengthened since we announced the acquisition back in February. We've been able to bring together two especially complimentary platforms in a way that creates a more balanced organization. Our global presence has expanded in key growth markets around the world. We've created an all-weather product offering with a greater range of specialized high-quality investment capabilities, all with an eye toward delivering exceptional client outcomes. It's important to note that the company we have become could not have been realized alone. Together, we have significantly enhanced our ability to meet the needs of clients, advisors and shareholders for many years to come. And client reactions to the acquisition have been consistently positive. We're excited about this integration, not just the strategic benefits, but also for the impressive group of people and leaders it will bring on board. We were pleased to be joined by so many talented professionals from Legg Mason with a 97% acceptance rate of employment offers made to Legg Mason holding company employees. An integral part of our planning efforts has been the frequent and productive conversations we've had with the leaders of each of the specialist investment managers or SIM. We've appointed certain SIM leaders to global or regional leadership roles in different areas of the company to fully reinforce our strong alignment, our shared focus and commitment to each other. We're also pleased to report that our global distribution team is now in place and is already able to cross sell investment products from both organizations across retail and institutional channels globally. Our new more utilized client centric distribution structure is designed to increase end-to-end accountability for regional growth and ensure clients get the most out of their relationships with us. Our specialized investment managers also each retain their strong institutional distribution capabilities. We have focused on preserving the independent investment autonomy of the Sims, while providing them with the opportunity to benefit from Franklin Templeton global infrastructure and investments in technology. In one exception, Franklin Templeton multi asset solutions, and QS investors have combined to form Franklin Templeton investment solutions. This single best in class platform brings together the powerful combination of Franklin Templeton active, fundamental capabilities with QS quantitative skills to customize multi asset portfolios for clients. The team now has more than 120 investment professionals overseeing more than $120 billion in multi asset strategies, creating a sizable solutions business with scale to compete with the largest full-service providers. We're seeing the benefits of adding world class franchises to an already strong set of investment capabilities. We continue to believe that active management will play an increasingly important role in client portfolios. And we're well positioned to capitalize on this. On the performance front, approximately half of mutual fund assets are outperforming their peers over the standard time periods, including over 100 funds raised four or five stars by Morningstar. We also have strong institutional performance, with 63%, 69%, 73% and 84% of assets, beating the applicable benchmarks for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods respectively, most notably in fixed income and alternatives. On the sales front, US fixed income attracted record net outflows of $5.7 billion in the quarter. We're pleased to see strong, long-term net flows from Western Assets, which reached $410 billion in long term assets, and $479 billion in total assets, its highest level on both front in over a decade. Additionally, as of quarter end, Western total assets under management were $12 billion higher than at the time, the acquisition was announced. Western investment performance has been outstanding, our fixed income pipeline across the firm strong, with at least $6 billion of unfunded wins and a significant opportunity pipeline. We recently introduced a new portfolio management team structure for the Franklin municipal bond team to align portfolio managers with common strategies across the platform. We believe this will further enhance investment performance that rebounded this year with 85% of assets ahead of peers for the one-year period, contributing to positive net flows for the year. On a combined basis across the firm, our tax-free fixed income AUM has increased to almost $85 billion. ClearBridge AUM is close to its all-time high standing at $153 billion with strong investment performance and flows in several strategies. Royce and Martin Currie strategy also has strong investment performance, with essentially flat flows for the quarter. Franklin equity group continues to achieve strong performance and attract inflows. Franklin DynaTech funds generated $4.4 billion in net inflows for the year, more than doubling its assets under management to over $18 billion, combined with Franklin growth and Franklin rising dividend funds, the Franklin equity group now has three funds near or above $20 billion of assets under management. In terms of global macro, our performance challenges an attrition from Franklin Templeton and Brandywine global macro strategy persist. These continue to be positioned for more challenging market conditions. These set strategies also made up some ground on peers and the benchmark in the quarter. It's undeniable that with Franklin Templeton, Western and Brandywine, we have a truly unique position and extensive capabilities across global macro strategies. Similarly, Templeton global equity and Franklin mutual security strategies continue to experience outflows, but are well positioned for periods that favor value investing. With the addition of Clarion Partners, along with Benefit Street Partners, and K2 Advisors, the alternative asset class recorded its fifth consecutive quarter of net inflows and now represents $124 billion in assets firm wide. Clarion is experiencing strong investor interest with an inbound queue of over $1 billion. Benefit Street partner price to new CLOs in the quarter totaling $800 million and received additional commitments of approximately $300 million. Momentum in our alternative business continues to build. As investors become more and more cognostic, we're well positioned in the retail SMA segment of the market, where we are now a leading franchise with $103 billion in assets compared to just $6 billion a year ago. And our expanded ETF offering doubled to over $10 billion in AUM this year. We are also planning to expand our closed end fund capabilities. Turning to financial highlights, adjusted operating income increased to $429 million, a 58% increase versus last quarter, or 5% from the prior year, largely reflecting the addition of two months of Legg Mason. We are on track to realize $300 million of gross synergies with 85% of run rate savings expected to be realized by the end of fiscal year 2021. The cost to achieve these savings is expected to be approximately $200 million, which is $150 million less than originally anticipated. And we expect to realize approximately $600 million of cash tax benefits related to the various tax attributes and deductions, which carried forward in the transaction, a 20% increase from our initial estimate. Our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with tremendous flexibility to evolve our business. Earlier this month, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal senior notes due 2030 issuing at 1.6% coupon and pre funding our intention to call higher coupon junior subordinated notes, which are callable at par in March and September 2021. And finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their significant efforts to keep our business operating smoothly during these extraordinary times and for maintaining their laser focus on our clients needs. Now, I'd like to open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. KenWorthington: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. With the integration of Legg well underway, can you talk about the integration of the two distribution networks thus far? I think on the last call, you talked about building more agile in regional distribution organization. So I wanted to hear any updates there. And then you gave a cross selling anecdote in the commentary. And I was hoping you could flesh out kind of how you'd expect cross selling to ramp given the integration, and maybe what products might be most successful, given what you've learned over the last couple of months. Thanks. JennyJohnson: Yes, so thanks for the question, Ken. So first thing was a decision to more regionalized. So what does that mean? We wanted to push out more marketing and product and data analytics out to the region. So historically, that was done more centrally. And so now, there's a portion of it that completely controlled by the head of that region. And as you probably know, we talked about some of the SIM head taking on leadership roles. Adam Spector and he is CEO of Brandywine is now Head of Global Distribution. And Julian Ide, who was the Head of Martin Currie is now Head of Europe. And so that's just helpful in ensuring that we understand both how to integrate the global distribution with really how each of the SIM handles their distribution. And so it's helpful having people who come from that perspective. As far as you look at US retail, which is a trillion dollars of our assets, Legg Mason came in with a much stronger footprint in the broker dealer warehouse channel and we were much stronger in the independent channel. We now have $103 billion in SMEs, they were very top three SME provider. And so it was really looking at the capabilities between the two organizations, and figuring out how to, and in some cases, you just have great people on the same covering channel but one has greater penetration than that. And so our distribution team is really a mix of Legg Mason and historic Franklin Templeton people, and it was, we were trying to recognize kind of where those types were. They had strong penetration in the insurance channel. So they're great in the Legg Mason folks. We have spent trying to remember the number, something like 1,200 people have participated in something like 83 webinars that we've done to teach and ensure that there's, like all the sales people have knowledge of each other's products. So we spend a lot of time with that. You saw the anecdotes in the comments. We also had another example, where we had an Israeli institutions were - that never had any distribution in Israel, and ended up getting a mandate for one of the SIM. So this takes a little bit of time, but I can tell you that we are, we felt really good about how it's operating now, and that we found less overlap than they thought we find with distribution when you really got under the covers. MatthewNicholls: I think I just add one thing to that, which is to say on the institutional side, recognizing how important the institutional distribution is, given the fact that a big portion of Legg Mason and the rationale for our transaction was to grow institutional business, that staying largely exactly as it's organized today at the specialized investment manager level, and that creates a high degree of confidence with clients, the stability and continuity in that area of the business. JennyJohnson: And actually, let me add one other thing you asked the question of, how we get more positive flows. As you saw, we had things like the alternatives were actually had been in positive flow; we think there is just huge amount of opportunity for Clarion and BSP and the retail channels and BSP did a small acquisition of REIT and it really what they were doing was acquiring some wholesalers who have expertise in selling alternatives to the RA channel. So we've invested tremendous opportunity for both Clarion and BSP, as well as feedback we've had some warehouses who feel that they may have a heavy concentration in the real estate managers that they have. And they'd like to diversify and clear and coming out of these just tremendous performances as they were overweight and things like industrials, and underweight say retail. Western, obviously continuing its cross-sell capabilities. What we have in the SMA side is the Income Fund is able to be penetrating more than relationships that like Mason has with advisors and sell SMA, we think that's a great opportunity for income funds. And I do have to say that, I think with the Templeton global bond, there is increasingly nervousness around whether - they're very much set up for risk off environment as Brandywine. And we've seen them perform very well in September. And as investors may think of them as sort of an insurance policy right now to any kind of big catalyst of the surprises, whether as an inflation surprises or escalation of US China tensions. And so I think the story is we're doing a better job of getting out their story there, I think we can at least begin to see some reduction in the redemptions. And again, it's kind of positioning that message as insurance. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. PatrickDavitt: Hey, good morning, all. Could you give us the amount of reinvested distributions in the long-term flow numbers so we can better compare it to your public comp? MatthewNicholls: Yes, we had $2.5 billion of reinvested distributions for the quarter. Those compares to $3.5 billion last quarter, and as you know $3 billion a year ago. Our plan there, by the way, we seem to have caused some confusion here was to call out anything that's unusual around those flows. We decided to get to have a simplified view of flows in terms of the presentation of it. So we had client - so we have client driven activity and client activity out. And given our size and breadth of our business, we thought that made the most sense, but we're not trying to avoid discussing reinvested distributions with anything unusual around it. We were planning to discuss it, for example, the year end, as you know that's often elevated. And we plan to call it out at that time, but that's the number for the quarter is $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion last quarter, as you know $3 billion a year ago. PatrickDavitt: Perfect, thanks. And on the fee rate guide, is there any kind of money funds do you ever headwind built into that? And through that lens, how much have that started to hit and the most recent quarter? And maybe any view on how it's tracking kind of into the December quarter? MatthewNicholls: Yes, it's fully included in the projection. PatrickDavitt: Great. And was it impactful in the last quarter? MatthewNicholls: Not relative to the size of our business and also given the structure of our rate with Western that has the largest portion of our money market business. We have some protection there on the margin. So it's not big, it's absolutely not material to overall company operation. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. CraigSiegenthaler: Good morning, Jenny, Matthew, hope you're doing well. I wanted to start with M&A. And so just given the pickup in M&A speculation in US asset management, we want to see a Franklin would consider doing another large acquisition over the next 12 months, knowing that you're still in the process of digesting Legg Mason, which probably isn't easy on the organization. MatthewNicholls: Yes, I think the way that we felt that is that we are absolutely in the flow of what's going on. You're right, there's a tremendous amount of activity in the industry with some interesting opportunities to consider, broadly speaking, I think in many ways, the evolution of the industry, terms of some of the more dramatic ideas are out there, it's just getting started. But we are, we're very, very focused on making sure that we maximize the output from the Legg Mason transaction. I mean, we literally doubled the size of our company from an assets under management perspective, we, every time when we have meetings internally, we peel the onion back, and we realize we've got another opportunity internally either to be more efficient or to work together to produce more revenue. So I think that's our primary focus, but we are in the flow on these things. We're not shut for M&A by any stretch, if there was something tremendously compelling. In particular, on the distribution side, if there was something that helps us with distribution further to what we already have, we're looking at it very carefully, we still have a very strong balance sheet. We're not going to compromise that. We have strong earnings potential; we're not going to compromise that, given the opportunities we've got to use our cash elsewhere internally. But it's fascinating times and we are one of the companies that are quite actively pursuing ideas in the industry and making sure we keep up with the flow of change. JennyJohnson: Yes, and I just add that. Exact with Matt, it takes a lot for us to want to take on something else before we digest this one. But you never know. I mean, it was - you're very intentional about keeping, having dry powder in case something else just came up with the bars probably a little bit higher on any big deal. But we've also said that we continue to want to grow our high net worth business. And as Matt said, if there's something that sort of distribution related, which tends to be more on the technology side that we were always looking at those and then we stay in the for the industry, because the industry is changing pretty dramatically. CraigSiegenthaler: Thank you. Just as my follow up one flow; we've seen this really strong migration into fixed income in the US. And then you have a much stronger bond business now with the addition of Brandywine and Western. But your flows were a little bit negative in the quarter due to the global bond. Do you expect the bond migration to continue for the industry even though yields are very low? And then if you do think it'll continue, do you think Franklin as a company can start to participate, just as all the pieces start working together? GregJohnson: Yes, I mean, this is Greg, I would say that you really have to separate out between what Western is doing on US fixed income side. We've seen a lot of strength in areas like [Indiscernible] we think that's going to continue as Fed REIT our rates and possibly federal rates go up. So I think that's very positive. Obviously, rates declined, mostly over the period. So any duration and even credit worked very well. And that's really why Western stood out. And it'd be a very strong quarter for flows, if you just looked at our US fixed income, $5.5 billion or so of inflows for the quarter, it just gets masked by what's happening on the global bond side, which really is a category that is very different from the traditional fixed income buyer. And as Jenny said earlier, I look at the categories and any spike in rates, any contraction in spreads and credit, we saw that a little bit, we saw that in September, we may see that continuing a bit. And I think that will help global bond. At the end of the day, any asset category like especially global bond competes with everything else. And the returns when you compare US equities, and just straight US fixed, it doesn't look very attractive. I think it looks pretty attractive, fairly quickly, if you have any kind of move up in rates. And that's really why we think this is a nice balance to the overall portfolio. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. RobertLee: Thanks and good morning, everyone. First question, I find that, maybe --could you comment maybe just - want to understand the tax filing in 26% range, which, I know you mentioned as GAAP compared to kind of like, it was just kind of 22 or so kind of we're expecting initially, should we still expect 22% on adjusted basis or was - do you use 26% as the baseline, you're standing in advance around from there. I mean how we should we think about it. MatthewNicholls: I'd use 26%, as the baseline, I mean, at the business, our business has changed in terms of, and we've got a greater portion of our business in the US with the higher tax rate. And there are a couple of jurisdictions internationally, where the tax rates have gone up a little bit. So that impacts our overall tax view. So I think I would use 26% with a view that maybe it could be 25%, but only 26% is a good number to put in the model for now. The fourth quarter was confusing, or we had a spike in that rate because of the reasons we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was just very unusual that spiked it up to 36%. RobertLee: Great and maybe just going back to the fee rate down to 36 and 38. And kind of fully consolidated basis, do you think you got kind of over, the kind of 2020, fiscal 2021 or is kind of long term. And unlike kind of exit run rate basis, just to be guessed at 38 and change in quarter just in two months of way. Is that --[Multiple Speakers] run rate? MatthewNicholls: Yes. The 36 to 38 is assuming a full year, so that's the full 12 months combination, if you will, we think that's a good guide based on, obviously, the very significant mix of business change. So with a much bigger fixed income business, and much bigger institutional business growth that lowers the rates versus legacy Franklin Templeton, which brings that down. But at the same time, there is opportunity there in the alternative site where the fee rates are quite a bit higher. And we see some interesting growth opportunities there. So you have global bond being, federal bond higher rate being offset by lower rate, broader fixed income, business core plus institutional, that's what brings it down. And then pressure upwards, if you will, is the growth of the alternative business. So we hope we're on the higher end of it, but we think that's the natural range for the year. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. DanFannon: Hi, thanks. So just follow up on one more question just in terms of the assumptions for your guidance. Do the theories assume any level of performance fees? And if so kind of looks the baseline also, as you think about your expense guidance and the fee rate guidance you gave what is the market assumption that you're using, was it flat or are some modest growth? MatthewNicholls: So we assume flat, we don't assume any market growth in our projections, one. Two, that the fees do not include performance, the average fee rate projection does not include performance fees. We expect our performance fees to actually go up. They were $10 million for this quarter from zero last quarter standalone at fee, we start to enjoy a larger percentage of performance fees from Clarion after April next year. So that provides an opportunity we share 50 :500 performance fees with them today, whereas today, we don't get any. It's 50% on our 83% ownership in Clarion. So that's an opportunity to get more performance fee so and in previous times last quarter was unusual, we had no performance fees in Benefits Street. But we expect that to pick up for example, this quarter went from zero to $4 million, we got $6 million from the Legg Mason side. And it wouldn't surprise us to see that go up quite a bit in 2021. DanFannon: Great, and then, in terms of the known redemption, you called out $3 billion in the prepared comments that we also then highlighted that it was not related to the transaction. So I guess what gives you confidence around that. And then just curious about other potential disruptions that might - we might see or have heard about coming from either just normal course of business or the acquisition. JennyJohnson: So as you say just on the, from the Legg Mason standpoint, Legg Mason was in positive flows in September, they have a much bigger institutional business. So you have lumpier redemptions, I think that's going to be more characteristics than we've seen historically, but basically haven't seen redemption related to any of this transaction, the bigger redemption tended to be Franklin Templeton, as we said, that one that we called out was a low fee, sub advisor relationship. There is some where you're seeing sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East redeeming larger numbers for - not for investment performance, not for transaction just because it's sort of what's going on in the market right now. So we are optimistic from the standpoint of integration and how things are going with clients. But you're always going to have, we still have the issues on performance in a couple areas like global macro, obviously value, and the value indexes as it performs 3,200 basis points year-to-date. So there's some people that are just ready to throw in the towel on value, others maybe it's time to that could switch. So those are always going to be, to the extent there on the institutional side a little bit more lumpy. MatthewNicholls: But as a general matter, obviously, we'd rather have no outflows $12.6 billion, it's not like we're pleased about $12.6 billion of outflows. But when you think about it, the $12.6 billion is very consistent with Franklin Templeton standalone outflows from the previous quarter, and both last quarter and the quarter before that. So the percentage attrition across the firm is come down a lot. And it's driven by exactly the same things that were - that are really market driven, if you think about the positioning of those strategies, and the all-weather point that Jenny is made a few times is an important one in this regard because we do have some very important strategies under the hood here that will do well, if the market starts to get more difficult again. I'd also say that out of our $11.5 billion of sort of unfunded wins that we have, we would expect something like $5 billion or so that come in the December quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. MichaelCyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the multi asset front, you guys have combined QS with the Franklin Templeton multi asset Solutions Group to create the standalone multi asset solution platform. Just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the strategy there. What you're most excited about? How you're thinking about the opportunity set? And then just the follow up there would be just as you look across the organization entirely, where else could it make sense maybe over time to think about bringing together some of the investment teams from Franklin Templeton and like to create similar sort of combined businesses and industry team. JennyJohnson: So on QS and SMA, very much a kind of that the teams got together and really thought about it talked about it and said, we could be much stronger together. So this is really kind of organically coming from those teams. Today, that combined organization has 120 investment professionals and $120 billion in assets. So what I think intrigued them on right makes sense for them to come to that get is QS was an institutional kind of quant, they had a strong track record and things like liabilities driven investments, active quants, risk mitigation risk, on the Franklin side, while there was quant capability was much more of really sort of active manager active allocations. And when they - and they have their own outside managers due diligence, so bringing them together, you're really bringing this hybrid of quants, and an active, and think about the way the world's going, whether it's models in retail, if your outcome oriented models in the retail channel, or risk overlay of separately managed accounts, clients are looking for being able to have a conversation, almost like an OCIO type of conversation, as they're trying to think through, how to build their portfolios, how to position their portfolio. And this just gives us tremendous capability around that. And we think that's the way future does. GregJohnson: I would just add, I mean, I think it also from a client service and institutional accounts, having that capability, and just the value-added side of looking at risk overlays, and LDIs opening up new channels like insurance. For us, it just increases the toolbox that we can offer to clients and hopefully deepen the relationships. And I also bring in examples, one example of scale, where you have a large organization, it's bringing all that expertise into one. And then hopefully, leveraging that with clients, we think that's very exciting. JennyJohnson: And just to answer the other part of the question about do we see opportunities to bring other groups together, we're not focused on merging products together, and that is not part of this deal. And you just talked to our CIO of global fixed income and CIO at Western. And they have different views on certain the timing on whether or not we'll see inflation or interest rate rise in the long end is that on the curve, and that's what an all-weather product lineup, it is that ability to have different products for different outcomes. And we think that's very healthy. Our distribution team has been selling equities, where arguably two different managers competing in the same category. They - you have to have the best distribution data, they have to be able to discern what the clients looking for, and either deliver up one option, or decide that you're going to answer the RFP with two different options in the same category, was very comfortable with that on the equity side, I can say that now, we just added that capability on the fixed income side. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. BillKatz: Okay, thanks very much for taking the question. So I guess I'm not sure Jenny or Matthew, just coming back to your fiscal 2021 expense guidance of $3.7 billion. What kind of sort of G&A assumptions are you playing by plugging into that number, just trying to get a sense of what you think about in terms of normal around travel, entertainment, sort of things that are probably depressed given the COVID-19 backdrop? MatthewNicholls: Hey, Bill. I hope your son is doing well. So I would say that we built in a sense of, again, maybe this is sort of optimistic for my distractive. But we're building a sense of normalization in the beginning say that in March next year. But we've also built in more in terms of advertising, promotion, these sorts of things that you'd expect us to do as we're, as we breathe, as we've been working on distribution, client franchise. So our G&A, we have forecasted for about $485 million for the year, which is a healthy number and allows us to continue to invest in a number of important things and does allow for travel, to go back to some form of normality after the first annualized quarter next year BillKatz : Great, that's helpful. And just as a follow up, I noticed you started to repurchase some stock in the quarter. So how do you counterbalance sort of reinvesting back into the business versus the return of cash to investors versus your commentary that it was just the beginning stages of an M&A evolution? MatthewNicholls: Yes, so you can see, when you look at our balance sheet back, in fact, we, last quarter, we ended at $8.2 billion or so billion on the cash and investments, we now have $5.1 billion cash investments. It's still quite healthy underpinning to give us confidence to use our income. Now income already with just two months of Legg Mason in there is pretty significantly enhanced. So I think what we plan to do at a minimum with respect to share repurchases, and make sure that we offset all of our share grants. And then obviously, we're very focused on the dividend and making, you know our history there. And you can expect that to continue subject to our board approving in December, the capital management policy. And then we have already multiple new requests internally, given the new breath of our firm to consider co investments, seek capital opportunities, other internal growth opportunities, and what I would say is that, as we reach the end either of a quarter or a year even, we then may do some top ups in terms of some additional share repurchases, if we don't feel pressure elsewhere. We also have a higher debt load, as you know, now, and we successfully access the market earlier this month, as Jenny mentioned, and we intend to use the proceeds that to refinance much more expensive notes, we're going to actually save about $30 million on that. But having said that, if rates stay where they are, maybe we just refinance out our notes going forward, and we stay at the current debt load assuming that EBITDA stays about the same because we want to keep our current credit profile intact. But if rates stay where they are, if rates get more expensive for the debt markets aren't as attractive, maybe we delever some as well without cash. So it's really a combination of those things. And the end of the day, if we have capacity to buy that more shares, given our current valuation, we'll do it. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. AlexBlostein: Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of clarification at this point. Matthew on the expense guidance, can you help us with some sensitivity to revenue assumption? So I know you said you guys are assuming generally flat markets in your expense guide for 2021. But if the markets were to be higher, can you help us understand kind of what's the sensitivity to that $3.7 billion with a kind of normalized market returns? MatthewNicholls: Yes, I think that $3.7 billion and given the fact that's an adjusted number, of course, the GAAP number could be higher or lower, because that includes SMA. But I'd say as an adjusted number, that's a disciplined number, that we have some comfort in that if the markets go up, it'll still be $3.7 billion. That's sort of how I would describe it. If the markets come down, it could come down. But I don't see us going up beyond $3.7 billion. AlexBlostein: Yes. And then another question, I guess, around capital management given the devaluation in the stock early in the free cash flow generation of business, can you help us understand the framework around making another acquisition, whether it's something small on a distribution side, or kind of continuously building out the IRA channel to find out what channel versus buying back Franklin stock in this level? MatthewNicholls: Yes, look, I think it's a great question because obviously the bar for us has to be quite high, given the fact that every dollar we're buying back in our stock is like probably like 6% dividend yield. So we're at quite focused on from that. We won't be doing large stock deals based on our current multiple and dilute. Okay, no, I'm okay. I fixed it. Alex, can you hear me? Okay, so sorry about that. Where were we? I'm sorry. I've lost track of what we were just talking about. JennyJohnson: You were answering question about the decision on whether we buy back --. MatthewNicholls: Oh, yes, the high bar, yes. So we have a high bar for the reasons I just mentioned on our stock. And we're not going to do a large transaction using our stock unless it's for the same kind of multiple. So the way I said is that in wealth management, we think it's a very good use of our cash, because we did two small transactions, they both ended up being the accretive to us in terms of the execution around that little bit of cost savings, revenue growth, it all works out quite well. So in wealth, there'd be much smaller transactions that we use to continue to grow fiduciary trust. It's on the alternative asset side that we have to think. There are some interesting opportunities out there. And that would be where we would use our cash and our stocks so that's how I describe that. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. ChrisHarris: Thanks. So you highlighted the momentum you've been seeing in alternatives. But there are some concerns about real estate as an asset class, generally, quickly, commercial real estate. So how is Clarion position to deal with the downturn we're seeing in that particular area? JennyJohnson: So Clarion is overweight industrial so that area is done very, very well. If e-commerce demand goes up, Amazon needs more storage. And so it's more demand on cloud and things. And that's an area that they had focused on. And they were really underweight on the commercial real estate. So they are actually performance - is very well positioned right now with their performance. ChrisHarris: Okay, and then just one quick one on the expenses. I know, we've got some noise here, because Legg was, its revenue and profit share, and Franklin's more of the traditional model. So if we look at the aggregate expense base, what is the addressable cost base, if you will? In other words, what are these synergies being net of? Because I know we probably shouldn't be looking at the entire expense base when we're considering that. MatthewNicholls: No, I think you should. I think you should look at it as against the $3.7 billion that we've guided for 2021. I know, it's very early guidance. But I think it's correct to think of that as being addressable. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. MikeCarrier: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two follow up. Given a lot of moving parts with expenses, [Indiscernible] if you have like a fiscal 1Q starting point for the adjusted expense level given 25% of synergies realized by the end of September, and then the full impacted Legg and then any color on just the timing of, when we should expect the 85% during the year. MatthewNicholls: Yes, so on the only 85%, I'd say we've made good progress so far. I think we mentioned that we already achieved 25% of it by 9/30. We expect to achieve 50% by, yes, we said year end, but that's probably going to be more like the end of January. And then I would say the rest of it or the 35% that's left. We hope to get most of it by June. But there'll be some carefully managed expense reductions on the front office side and particular that we wanted to spend more time executing upon to make sure we make sure we have that continuity and stability around the group that we've discussed. So I think it's fair to say that we, again, we've got the 25% done end of January, we get the 50%, maybe we get 75% by the end of June, and then the rest up to 85% by the end of the fiscal year. In terms of a normalize, in term of - I think, one, maybe it's useful to walk through the revenue and expenses associated with what we bought on from Legg Mason. So Legg Mason two months was about $475 million of revenue. If you include sales and distribution fees, we exclude sales and distribution fees. It's about $415 million, so that sort of annual quarterized, if you will, into about $700 million to $720 million or $2.85 billion on an annualized level in terms of revenue. And the expenses, as you said, it's a bit of a noisy quarter to say the least with all the acquisition related expenses. But if you exclude the non-recurring acquisition related expense items, it was about just the Legg Mason two months was about $350 million inclusive of sales distribution, excluding that it's about $280 million. So I think about it as being, if you include sale and distribution, it's 475 minus 350, equals 125 times six to 750. That's one way of looking at it. If you execute sales and distribution, it's 415 minus 280, 135 times six is 810. So you could look at it as that we're adding to including the cost aids, that are included in those numbers, because remember, in the overlay, we haven't included the additional run rate that we expect to achieve during the years. Maybe I don't know if that helps but if you think about that as being an addition, on top of our business. MikeCarrier: Yes, that's helpful and then one just clarification on the fee rate. Just when I look at the quarter, the 38, it seems that was a little lower than expected from the pro forma. And then even with Franklin stand around 50. And then if I think about the alphabet of 36 to 38. If that includes like another month delay, it seems like that's not much of an impact, even relative to the 38. So I wasn't sure if there was just something else either impacting this quarter, we're impacting like the run rate or - MatthewNicholls: No, nothing in particular, we've modeled it out and we think they're good guide. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell. BrianBedell: Great, thanks very much. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions has been asked and answered. But just one follow up on the capacity for deals if you're doing them in cash, Matt, like you said, the $5.1 billion in cash and investments, what do you view as cash available for acquisitions within that, and then also additional debt capacity if you actually think about what type of cash level you'd be able to do? MatthewNicholls: Yes, it's probably, out of the cash, you see it's probably a $ 1 billion that because we're, again, we're quite conservative, we like to make sure we have the SUP, as you know we call it supplemental liquidity. And we intend to keep that in place. So we're disciplined around that. And so that's how we - that's probably what if you are looking for excess cash number that we would consider to be excess, it could be that. In terms of other people would maybe double that number and define it as that but we wouldn't. In terms of debt capacity, our absolute intention and focus is to make sure that we maintain our current credit profile, which is an A2 rating as you know, we just access the debt markets and we're very pleased with writing in that transaction, and we intend to retain that profile and operate the company and our capital structure in a way that's consistent with that. So our debt capacity at that level, we probably have some capacity, we don't intend to push out our limits whatsoever with the rating agencies or with our debt investors, given what we've described to them. So we're quite focused on that. The technical capacity to investment grade is very, very substantial in terms of debt, but we don't intend to use that. BrianBedell: Okay. That's helpful. And then Jenny just if you could talk a little bit about ESG. Obviously, Legg's managers had some good traction, certainly at ClearBridge and also Western and also a few other affiliates. How are you thinking about integrating that through Franklin or are you thinking about centralizing that ESG process and leveraging that across the totality of platforms or leaving the ESG capabilities within the individual managers. JennyJohnson: So with respect to ESG, we think that the framework in which you apply ESG is specific to the investment team. But the data, we're a member of [savvy] and trying to get a lot more standardization around the data, we've actually created a centralized database. So I think global macro team, they get 14 different data feeds to build their ESG framework, that data then goes into this centralized ESG database, any of the investment teams are welcome to use it as they built their own framework and model. But we really are working hard with savvy in the industry and Greg participates in the IPI on ESG. And trying to just standardize lot of the information that people look at to build their framework. But to answer your question, we think that it is part of the, fundamental part of the investment process. BrianBedell: Yes. That makes sense. May I ask one more real quick one? JennyJohnson: I'll make this little pitch, our Franklin municipal green bond fund is 9% year-to-date, this is our ESG and the main area, and it's like she got demand, great demand pretty nice and grand. BrianBedell: That's great. On that 97% employment acceptance, was that in line with what you were thinking, I guess. And were there any significant non acceptances from either PM or key leaders in that 3%. JennyJohnson: So again, that was focused on holding company and distribution. And I think what we set out, we weren't sure what percentage of that makes employees and I think we ended up both on distribution and on the holding company making a lot more like Mason plays. And I think you really - you should see that it's a combination of both groups. And no, there was no specific one that we felt like we really miss, and you we're not talking about investment people. Operator : Our last question for today will come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hey, yes. Brian has asked my question. So thanks. Jenny Johnson : Okay, great. Well, listen, I think, I just want to thank everybody for participating in today's call. And just want to leave you guys with one thought, what we knew from the beginning is only been further crystallized as and that is that our two organizations are really incredibly aligned in terms of strategic fit, culture and our shared focus on delivering strong investment results for our clients. And we look forward to continuing to stay at the forefront of our industry and again, keeping that balance sheet flexibility as things evolve, but really providing unparalleled investment choice and service for our clients. So thank you, everybody, for participating and be safe out there. Operator : Thank you for participating on today's conference call. Once again, we do appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factors and MD&A section of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn your call over to Franklin Resources' President and CEO, Jenny Johnson. Ms. Johnson, you may begin. Jenny Johnson : Hello. And thank you for joining us to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our first fiscal quarter of 2021. Following the close of the Legg Mason transaction on July 31, the results we announced earlier this morning include the first full quarter of the combined organization. On the call with me today is Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO and joining the call for the first time is Adam Spector. Adam joined our firm last July as Managing Partner of Brandywine Global and additionally became our Executive Vice President and Head of Global Distribution on October 1. To start, we hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. We'd also like to recognize our incredible employees who continue to work hard every day on behalf of our clients and firm. It has been six months since we closed our acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. And over that time, all while under a remote work environment, we've made significant progress in bringing our teams together to maximize our collective potential. We're seeing a high degree of stability within the organization, as well as a number of encouraging trends across the business. First off, assets under management reached a record high of approximately $1.5 trillion this quarter, driven primarily by strong market performance. That's an increase of $79 billion or 6% during the quarter. Turning next to operating and financial results. Adjusted revenues increased by 20% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to an additional month of Legg Mason results. Higher revenues and continued expense discipline resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted operating income to $550 million and an increase in operating margins to 37.2%. On the performance front, our investment results improved this quarter with 61%, 66%, 58% and 75% of our strategy composites outperforming their respective benchmarks for the four key time periods. Looking deeper into those numbers, Western Asset continues to have standout performance and reach $423 billion in long-term assets and $480 billion in total assets. It's highest level on both fronts in over a decade. Brandywine performance rebounded strongly and saw net inflows into global multi-sector products in the latter part of the quarter. And as we saw improvement in performance at ClearBridge and across many Franklin Templeton strategies, ClearBridge is another example of one of our specialized investment managers reaching a record in AUM, which was $176 billion at quarter-end. Likewise, our Fiduciary Trust high net worth AUM is at an all-time high of $32 billion. While the business also generated positive net flows for the quarter. Record AUM levels were also reached for Clarion Partners at $58.1 billion, long-term relative investment performance of our U.S. and international mutual funds also improved this quarter. A significant driver of the improvement was our Franklin Income Fund and several of our value oriented equity strategies also generated noteworthy results. We continue to see strong performance in U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income. Our mutual funds that are rated four or five stars by Morningstar increased during the quarter and now number 140 funds. On the distribution front, long-term net outflows are $4.5 billion, which includes $12.6 billion of reinvested distributions. But notably, momentum continued to build with positive flows into a number of our specialized investment managers, including Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Martin Currie, Royce and Western Asset. Franklin Equity Group saw strong inflows which were led the Franklin DynaTech, which reached a record $22.5 billion in AUM. As of quarter end, we have a promising institutional pipeline of opportunities and a combined total of won, but unfunded wins of $11 billion. As we've noted on previous calls, a strategic focus for the firm has been to expand our alternatives platform to offer strategies that do not lend themselves to passive replication. With $127 billion in assets under management in alternatives and robust relationships across the retail channel, we seen demand for our retail alternative offerings increase. Our EMEA region led the way with a focus on multi-strategy social infrastructure and real estate. Also importantly, as we look to deliberate investment expertise through our clients investment vehicle choice, we now have a top three market position in the retail SMA business, which saw positive net flows this quarter and increased to $113 billion in assets. In other news, we were excited to launch our new Franklin Templeton Investments into an innovative hub for research and knowledge sharing. Stephen Dover will be leading that effort with the launch of the Institute; we're doubling down on what sets our firm apart, unmatched insight and research from experts on the ground in over 70 locations around the world. At the same time, tapping into the strength of our collective leadership talent, we've expanded Terrence Murphy\u2019s role to become Head of Equities for Franklin Templeton, while retaining his existing role as CEO of ClearBridge Investments. While our equity teams will continue to maintain their individual investment processes and autonomy, Terrence will facilitate collaboration across the groups to drive results and growth. Looking at another key area, capital management remains an important focus. Our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. Cash and investments totaled $6.3 billion following the public offering of $750 million aggregate principal senior notes due 2030 issued at a 1.6% coupon. As previously explained, it is our intention to pay down more expensive debt with the proceeds of the offering. Excluding net proceeds from the senior note offerings, we have $5.5 billion in cash and investments. We also continued our track record of dividend growth for the 40 consecutive year with a 4% increase to our regular dividend in December. To wrap things up, over the past six months we've created a stronger firm that combines the best in both worlds; global strength and boutique specialization. Our global presence has expanded in key growth markets around the world with a greater range of specialized high quality investment capabilities. And we think that all points to a positive future. Now I'd like to open up the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious, you talked about cross-selling initiatives have started to yield positive results. You talked about Adam being new Head of Global Distribution. Can we drill down a little further and get some color on what Adam\u2019s mandate is? What new initiatives are producing these cross sells and what's being cross sold? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Sure. I mean, there is nothing better than hearing it from the horses match. So fortunately we have Adam on the line, so Adam take it away. Adam Spector : I think I was just caught a horse there. So if I think about what we're trying to do, it's really three priorities, growth [Technical Difficulty] Jenny Johnson : Adam, are you still\u2026 Adam Spector : Glenn, are you still there? Jenny Johnson : Adam, can you \u2013 are you \u2013 I think Adam\u2019s dialing back in. So where did I start? I mean, we are \u2013 for example, our largest distributor has just added 10 new funds, many of them are like Mason funds. And we \u2013 so we're seeing good penetration that is really cross-selling, and again, as we talked about, Franklin was much stronger on the independent side, Legg Mason was much stronger on the wirehouse side. And so we've been able to basically cross-sell platform listings and getting through the gatekeepers on those platforms. So that's worked well. And just to give you an idea from a diversification of flows, if you look at the top nine, I don't know why, the top nines as the top 10, but top nine of \u2013 it accounts for about 38% of our flows, five of those are Legg Mason funds, four are Franklin funds, and three of them are fixed income, five are equities and one is balanced. So we're seeing both a diversification by getting products on the platforms, cross-selling platforms are getting through the gatekeepers and getting them listed, so we'll continue see more penetration, as well as good diversification with the types of products. So that we don't have kind of the risk of the single large product that potentially gets out of favor. So it's much more diversified. I don't know, Greg, if you want to add anything there. Adam, you\u2019re back on, great. Adam Spector : Yes. I don't know how I got cut off on a landline with a cell phone message, but that's a new one in this day and age of working from home. So I did not have the ability to hear what Jenny said. So I'm going to maybe overlap a bit with her comments, but in terms of cross-selling there are a couple of things I would point to. One, the firm's legacy Franklin and legacy Legg Mason had different strengths. Franklin was really strong for instance in the regional broker dealers and we've been able to get Western and ClearBridge products on the platform there. We're seeing positive momentum there at the same time, when we look at something like the wires, where Legg Mason traditionally wasn't a little stronger, we've been able to have some real success with BSP there through legacy Legg Mason. The same thing is really true if we look outside of the United States, where Franklin for instance was much stronger in Canada, Legg Mason had a real strength in Japan, so we've been able to start some cross-selling initiatives there that are really quite positive. And even within countries where outside of the U.S. where both firms were strong like Germany, we had a situation where Franklin was much stronger in the retail banking world, Legg Mason in the private banking world. And again, that's when I said sell one set of products into the other legacy distribution system. Those are the types of cross-selling efforts that have been really strong, I would also say that cross-selling comes into play on defense as well, where we've had clients for instance that are in particular strategies that might be higher alpha, higher tracking error strategies when they want to de-risk what we've seen is that, that money instead of leaving our system can shift to another lower ball strategy that's within the system. So we're actually doing a better job retaining assets through cross-selling as well. Glenn Schorr : I think that's a lot of progress and a lot on the comment, and you combine that with all your new product offerings. I hate to be too forward leading, but do you have a shot at getting back towards flat flows like sometime towards the end of this year, are we trending that much in that direction? Adam Spector : I think we're trending really well, we see momentum, we see it month-over-month. Sales are strong, redemptions are getting better. And the other thing is we now have a combined salesforce that's in place for its first full quarter. Unlike \u2013 it takes people a little bit of time to hit their stride and they're hitting it now. So I'm feeling very good about the future. Glenn Schorr : Thanks for all of that. I appreciate it. Adam Spector : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and hope you're all doing well. I wanted to come back and dig a little bit deeper on your comments on rising demand for alternatives in the European retail channel. Can you talk about what markets and channels are driving the demand? And also what type of products or characteristics that they\u2019re looking for? Things like yield or low correlation, downside protection. Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Adam. Do you want to take that? Adam Spector : Sure. I think we're really seeing a push for alternatives in all regions in all countries. And that's one of our strengths. If we think about our core priorities of grow, defend and diversify. Diversify is all about moving more forcefully into alternatives. We have $120 some billion in our alternatives book, but probably this leap here is as quiet as alternatives firms you've never heard of. And we're making progress, you mentioned Europe. I think there is strong demand there, the other thing we see in Europe is strong demand for ESG. And we've got some alternative products that combine alternatives with ESG. That combination has been really strong for us. The other thing we're working to do is, given that we now can offer so many different vehicle types. We're really trying to take alternatives that used to be predominantly sold in the institutional market, in more of a separate account mandate and package them, so that they're much more saleable to the broad retail market. Jenny Johnson : And just to add to that, I mean, obviously everybody in this \u2013 low rate environment is looking for yield. And so you see a lot more searches both on the institutional side and as Adam mentioned, gaining traction on the retail side for private credit with BSP, perfectly positioned great performance, traditionally just in institutional managers. So being well received on the \u2013 and actually have gotten some traction in the retail side, as well as Clarion is coming out of this in the real estate space, there is uncertainty in certain spaces for real estate. But they've been large industrial tech, they're one of the largest \u2013 I think they are the largest lessor to the cloud storage environment, and so they performed very, very well. So in a low yield environment, people are looking for assets with yield and that is served both Clarion and BSP well. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And then I just had a quick follow-up coming back to Glenn's question on net flows. You guys just did a big merger. You reduced the size of your salesforce, not a lot, but a little bit. So I imagine there could be some dis-synergies out there that you're seeing. If there are any dis-synergies or any kind of redemptions driven by the merger and they're in the flow run rate today, do you see them dropping off in the future, which would actually help your net flow trajectory? Jenny Johnson : I would say that let me just start and then Adam will pick up. I would say a couple of things. One is we're only really aware of two, we'll call them deal-based redemptions. One in Korea, which we talked about on the last earnings call and most recently Legg Mason\u2019s 529 plan and part of the issue there was \u2013 there was just an agreement that they would only have one 529 plan and Franklin obviously has one already with the New Jersey 529 plan. Otherwise we are not seeing any kind of deal issues with respect to \u2013 you go from two salesforces to one, you're talking about relationships on the retail side, just to give you an example of the \u2013 say 150,000 financial advisors, we're talking like less than 0.1% or some, I mean, just teeny number of complaints with the change of advisor, we've been really surprised by how little complaints we've had in ultimately when you're having to pick kind of who's going to win out a territory. And that's really because of Legg Mason strike again in the big wirehouses in Franklin, in the independent. So there wasn't the kind of overlap you would have expected on many deals. So there was not really product overlap and not really distribution overlap. Adam, do you want to say anything else? Adam Spector : Yes. I think Jenny hit all the right points out of the 10s of 1,000s of advisors we contacted she's right, we had less than 10 basis points of negative reaction that we track. The other thing I would say is that fall in the U.S. the salesforce is essentially 50-50 in legacy Franklin and legacy Legg, that's not true by channel. Our regional channel is predominantly Franklin Templeton, people are wired channel is predominantly [Technical Difficulty]. So that really limited the disruption that we had, because we kept the folks who were strongest in specific channels and moved to a channelized approach in sales, which we did not have before Franklin Templeton. Greg Johnson : And just it might help to just try and put a little bit of data around this. We, in the executive commentary what we did is in a footnote in some of the charts, we did some \u2013 a little bit of pro forma assuming we closed the transaction a month earlier to include a full three months of Legg Mason. And when you look at that, you'll notice that the sales are roughly the same and the redemptions are a little bit lower. So obviously we want redemptions to come down further, we want sales to go up. But in terms of trying to understand and quantify attrition risk, when we look at the pattern quarter-by-quarter, it's looking quite encouraging so far. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. Thank you guys. Greg Johnson : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I guess one more question, just kind of on distribution and sales and you guys have been discussing the retail opportunity and the momentum you have. I guess, can you talk about the consultants and the institutional potential opportunity? Maybe also just get into the won but unfunded pipeline, the diversity there, but also kind of those gatekeepers and how progress in terms of opening up those channels might be going? Adam Spector : Sure. The way I look at won but unfunded is, it's good news, it's essentially staying steady. I think the number is around $11 billion and it's staying steady, not because we're not adding, but because we're actually funding deals out of that, so that's going strong. What I would say in terms of consultants is that Franklin Templeton central distribution has historically distributed to the consultant community, institutional community for the Franklin investment team, many of the Legg Mason investments affiliates, in fact, I believe all of them did that on their own. Going forward, we're having a differentiated approach where the Legg Mason SIMs will continue to call on the consultant as they always have, that's been a really successful channel for them, remember like as much stronger in the institutional business historically. So we're not changing that approach to the investment consultants. Outside of the U.S., some of the smaller former Legg Mason SIMs are beginning to leverage Franklin Templeton's resources, especially in the coverage of field consultants where those SIMs may cover the research centers on their own, but we'll have much more connectivity with the field consultants. I would say in general, what we're trying to do with consultants is similar to what we're trying to do with global financial institutions is recognizing that many of these large consultants are global firms, and we have to face all of them holistically as a global firm. So that's how we've organized ourselves. And we are really allowing each investment team to tap into our centralized coverage of consultants as they see fit. In general, the larger SIMs like Western might not need help at all in that area, where some of the smaller groups definitely rely on the central distribution teams. Dan Fannon : Great. And then just as a follow-up in terms of the expense outlook and understand the movement in assets and higher markets drove a bit of the increase. But just curious about your assumption for normalization of travel and marketing and spending that kind of went away this past year, as you think about the progress for this year. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So in our numbers and in the guidance that we've given that we've assumed that there will be a pickup in travel and some other G&A items like advertising in terms of the combined company and what we need to do there in the third and fourth quarter in particular, we have moved that forward a bit, but we haven't taken the money out of our assumptions. So we would expect G&A to creep up a little bit in the next \u2013 in the last two quarters in particular, I would say. But that's included in the $3.75 billion of guidance. So I think the number that's more likely to move a little bit, which is what caused the change a little bit in the guidance is the comp and benefits in line with revenue and we expect we're selling more, so that's \u2013 there's some more commissions involved in that, it's all linked with the growth of the business. So I think we could expect the compensation line on an adjusted basis to go up, a couple or so percent, maybe up 3% in the next quarter, because of the cost saves from the transaction of expect that to come down in the third quarter by about 1% or 2%, and then down again in the fourth quarter by about 4%, probably maybe a little bit more than that, which then gets us to the to the $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion, maybe a little bit more if the markets stay stable. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First just a follow-up on the distribution question. Can you provide some context on the process and importantly just the timing of getting like the full line of a product for as much as you can throughout the distribution channels? And maybe for context, what has happened maybe thus far and what to expect in 2021 versus longer-term? Adam Spector : Yes, I think the way I think about this is we had to go about this in several stages. So the first stage was really selecting the team, getting them settled into their territories and that happened. The next stage that we're in the middle of right now is because they're all trained, the sales teams are all trained, but in order for them to really cross-sell effectively, we have to get all of our products cross-listed on the different platforms and research approved. That's really what we're doing now, we've started where you might expect that our largest distribution partners, where we think we can get the most bang. We've got two of them already where we've on-boarded a number of products, we're kind of marching through that and it's going pretty well. So it's really a question of getting the back offices set up correctly and getting things on the platform. The distributors themselves are eager to have it, one of the things we're seeing that across the board is that people want to do more business with fewer bigger players. So the fact that we're able to bring such an array of investment styles and not only investment styles, but different vehicles from funds to SMA the ETF to these partners, that makes us much more attractive to them. So they're really working as quickly as they can with us to get our products onboarding, as we get them on-board at what we're seeing is that we're able to start to sell more. So for instance, at some of the regionals, we've seen a real uptake in December and January for some legacy Legg Mason products on the regional platforms, because those are just getting on-boarded now, it's continuing worse, but it's going well and we're a bit ahead of schedule. Mike Carrier : Okay, great. And then Matt, just not expense, you provided a helpful update. You also mentioned looking at additional ways to operate the business more efficiently, maybe split some of these areas, as well as areas that you're looking at from an investment standpoint. Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks Mike. So I think there is two things there. First of all, as we spend more time together as a joint company, I think just naturally speaking we find interesting ways to improve how we work together. That's not just operational things, it's how we can share information and improve price of that information from various vendors. We spent a lot of money on data and information across the investment teams and process specialized investment managers, there is that natural embedded leverage in that system in terms of data safe money and we're just really frankly just scratching the surface on that. And that also benefits the teams away from just cost. The cost is a good output from that work. And then we have been working very hard on our operations side and technology side on the future and how to position the firm in terms of capital expenditures, understanding what that is risk management and potential cost efficiencies with different partners externally. And we've seen some very interesting things there. So nothing specific to report now, but I think over the next six months to a year, we're going to see some very interesting opportunities for the firm, and we\u2019re likely to take action. And to put some numbers around it, we don't have any you specific guidance today. But we're talking $20 million, $25 million per annum at least on some of the things we're looking at, and we'll provide more guidance to that in the next quarter. Mike Carrier : Great. Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey guys, very good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up with respect to cross-selling opportunities and given the combined franchise, you guys have a really robust set of products and capabilities, and you named quite a bit in terms of where you're seeing cross-selling opportunities for the combined firm. I was wondering if you could just kind of maybe narrow this down a little bit. And if we were to focus on three affiliates where you\u2019re seeing sort of the most incremental dollars of net inflows from cross-selling, what are those affiliates? Adam Spector : I guess, I don't really think about it in terms of the most dollars. I think about it as where is there a significant demand. So obviously given Western's broad exposure to everything, fixed income and their size and breadth, we're seeing a lot there. ClearBridge, I would say has a very strong capability in ESG and that's across the board with that in favor ClearBridge has seen real growth. For anyone has a few income oriented funds that are global given the demand for income that's strong. Royce, Martin Currie, we saw inflows for them that were more than 5% of the firms, so strong demand there. If you take a look at a group like Clarion of what's more in demand than alternatives, and they're the top of their game in real estate. So really across the board, we're seeing demand for all of our firms. Jenny Johnson : Well, and I would just add that's sort of giving the Legg Mason crossing into a lot of the traditional Franklin and the reverse of that is, in some of the big wirehouses we're getting interest on BSP, DynaTech is getting phenomenal for the Franklin Equity Group support. And so, it's really about bringing the entire firm to where we have deep relationships. And again, there just wasn't the overlap. So any of those kind of key products across the board are making sense at any of the firms that you're just filling in and complimentary where say we didn't have the representation. Adam Spector : Yes, Jenny; and I misunderstood the question. I thought it was a one-way question. You're right. So there is equal strength going both directions. And the other thing we're seeing is that for instance, there is some products that have been around for decades that we're able to offer in new vehicle types. And that's another way to cross-sell, that\u2019s really attracted and we're seeing significant growth in our SMA business there. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks for that. And I guess along similar lines of new business, sorry, if I missed this, but $11 billion pipeline, can you specify which affiliates comprise the pipeline and what's the fee rate associated without AUM base? Adam Spector : I do not have that data, I'll have to get back to you from a hierarchy on that. Matthew Nicholls : I mean, most of it's fixed income with Western, which you'd expect and some Franklin Templeton fixed income as well would be the top two of the pipeline of funded wins. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning, everyone. It's Patrick Davitt. Thanks for the call. First question on the fee rate obviously already came in a little bit above what you got into last quarter, probably I guess, because the market came in so much better than you expected. So is it still fair to assume kind of 36 to 38 with a more normal market, or do you think it could track even higher, given you're already above what you got to do last quarter? Matthew Nicholls : I think the way that we just sort of describe that, I mean, the reason why it was higher is because of the mainly that the increase in equities in the quarter, because of the strength of the equity markets. And then we grew in alternatives also and I think the right way to answer the question is when we think about the things that push up the fee, it took where higher in equities and alternatives and lower global bond outflows in any of our outflowing areas that we've experienced over the last several quarters that you're very familiar with. If any of those turn in, just a little way that also helps with the fee rate. And we saw that in the last quarter also in having less outflows in those areas. What pushes the fee rate down is if we scale up much faster in institutional fixed income and/or if we see outflows in the higher \u2013 the areas that we just \u2013 that I just talked about. I think we model out and I think we've talked about this, a fairly steady fee rate for the year, all else remaining equal. We don't see any reason why we shouldn't be in the 38 area. But there could be a continued significant momentum in institutional fixed income, which could be a very positive reason for the fee rate going down, all else remaining equal. So that's \u2013 I think 36 is pretty \u2013 very, very much on the low end of things. And I think we wouldn't say guide to higher, but I certainly say we would expect to be close to where we are today for the year. Patrick Davitt : Okay, thanks. Very helpful. My follow-ups on the India situation, which looks like it's finally getting close to resolution so could you update us on how much AUM, we can see come out, as those funds open up again, that's already been turned off. So we can kind of adjust their estimates when you report AUM. And then I guess, more broadly the news has been pretty negative. So any update on the impact to the broader Indian franchise would be helpful. Jenny Johnson : So, I mean, first of all, we're thankful that the shareholders voted overwhelmingly in support of winding up those funds. And then most recently, the Supreme Court came out and approved our being able to distribute the cash in them, which I think is maybe 42%, if I'm remembering the right percentage of assets. So that'll go out pretty soon. We are taking a fee on those assets right now, so it's already out from a fee standpoint. And then, we continue to see flows, recent flows but also retention in the remainder portion of our business, both the equity and the liquid assets. We're very much committed to India and we continue to see support in that market. Patrick Davitt : Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me? Matthew Nicholls : Hi. Brian Bedell : Can you hear me? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Brian Bedell : Okay, great, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one on the \u2013 just to the extent on the fee guide into the approximately 38 basis points, what is the expectation from money market fund or money market \u2013 cash management product fee waivers in that, I guess, coming into the year \u2013 coming into next quarter? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, again, \u2013 yes, so it's embedded in that already. We currently have about something like an $8 million fee waiver at the holding company level or the corporate level because of the revenue share with those involved principally with the money market fund business that moved our \u2013 the impact on the overall firms, as $8 million now we expect that to par to be close to $10 million by the end of the year, but that's all embedded within the fee rate guidance, which is good. Brian Bedell : Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe follow-up for both Adam and Jenny on the ESG progress, obviously, you said a pretty strong demand in Europe and within alternative products as well. It sounds like ESG is fairly well integrated in the research process based on how you're describing it, but maybe if you could talk about whether you still think there is more integration to happen across the research investment portfolio management research process. And especially, the plan for leveraging that and launching new ESG dedicated products. And if you can also comment on the AUM that you see right now in your ESG dedicated products? Jenny Johnson : So I always find it interesting. I was talking recently and somebody gave me a fact or stat that something like a third of asset managers\u2019 assets or ESG. And the reality is that I think maybe we have an advantage as a real global player. Anybody is a global player and has operated in markets in Europe or Australia has had to have this very focused and incorporate into their investment process. So it's our belief that there's going to be no credible manager out there, certainly at an institutional level without being able to clearly articulate how they're considering ESG risks in their investment process. And we feel very good about all of our teams and they\u2019re having incorporated their consideration of those risks in their investment processes. As a matter of fact, we've talked about our investment data lake, where we have unique sources of data that are contributed by various teams and they're available for any teams for their analysis. We've done the same thing on ESG. So we have a portion of our investment data lake that is dedicated to ESG. So for example, our global macro team get 14 different feeds. It goes into the ESG data lake, and that data is now cleansed and available for any of the teams to consider it in their process. And that's important as we all know because ESG, the top five ESG providers only correlate 57% of the time. So you can imagine that it really takes active management and engagement to get accurate ESG information. So to answer your question, it is absolutely well incorporated in all of our processes. We also \u2013 Europe is coming out with something Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9. And we have been very focused on ensuring, I think it's the March date that the products that are selling there and the ones that are pipeline to sell there qualify for those. So Article 6 is, it is ESG evaluated and considered Article 8 is I've overweight ESG considerations in my portfolio construction. And Article 9 is really kind of impact investing. And so we have products like our Paris Aligned, our first active global or green bond ETF. We have a social infrastructure and those are getting good flows there as well as they qualify for Article 9. So we think ESG remains to be seen. And I just \u2013 anecdotally, prior to the lockdown, I had visited U.S. institutions a year before the lockdown. And it was very mixed in the U.S. whether or not they were focused on ESG. And right before the lockdown, I visited institutional investors and every single one was talking about ESG. So that's why we are focused and committed. Adam, I don't know, still you want to add to that. Adam Spector : It\u2019s perfect. I would only say that one of the advantages here of being a global firm is that while this is kind of a trend that is strong and developed, but a little bit newer in the U.S., we've been active in France and the Nordics and Australia for years, and it's just part of what you do. It has to be 100% integrated into investment process. So all of our investment teams have ESG that integrated, what we're moving to do is to create more impact funds kind of at the far extreme of the ESG spectrum. But we're completely integrated with ESG across all of their teams at this point. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : Next question from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Jenny Johnson : Hey Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had to circle back on retail SMA, I think you\u2019ve mentioned we had about $113 billion of retail SMA. I just hoping you can kind of give us a sense of maybe how that breaks down by asset class and channel. If you can just talk about some of your initiatives to accelerate growth with the retail SMAs, and which strategies are you most optimistic on growth in the SMA vehicle? Matthew Nicholls : I think the places where we're most optimistic about SMAs as a vehicle are for those strategies that are most in demand. So, Franklin Income Fund is still something we sell a lot of, DynaTech or Franklin technology. All of those products have very good flows, very good sales, and I think we can move more from a fun sale to offering different vehicles on the Legg Mason side, ClearBridge and Western have been leaders in that for years. From a channel perspective, we've had the most strength with the SMA business than the wires, and we're starting to expand more of our SMA business\u2026 Michael Cyprys : Great. Just maybe as a quick follow-up on the SMA side, I guess, just any color you could share around the fee rate and margin profile for your SMA business, maybe how that compares versus say the 40 Act mutual fund vehicles. And I imagine, there's lower fee, maybe a little bit more costly to serve, but arguably probably duration of the assets is probably a little bit longer, a little bit more sticky or so I was just curious, any color you could elaborate around that? Matthew Nicholls : We'll come back to you on that with specifics, I just\u2026 Jenny Johnson : The thing I would just highlight there, SMAs are gaining great traction because in a fee-based environment it allows the financial advisor to appear to be much more active in their investment decisions. So we think that trend is really important, it's also by direct index and we think it will be important in the future. Remember that there are not a lot of those kinds of embedded fees that are arguably distribution or service fees in an SMA that you may have in a mutual fund. So that's why it's \u2013 you can't look at the top line fee rate and compare it apples to apples because it isn't quite that, but we will come back with more details. Michael Cyprys : Right. But is it fair to say that it is longer duration capital but the assets are stickier? Does any thoughts on that last point? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean, I think we think of it as being a minimum of five, it's an average, like, I can't remember the exact, I think it's like five years or something and something like that, because you think about the average across the industry, but we'll come back to you on that, on details around those specifics. Michael Cyprys : Thanks very much. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Next question from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Mr. Lee, your question is open. Robert Lee : Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Jenny, can you possibly drill in a little bit more into this GOE, goals optimization engine? Just trying to get a sense of, what that is precisely \u2013 because it seems like there's different aspects to it. And while its still early days, how you were thinking about that just help and comprise the demand like what should we be looking forward to see that working in this space? Jenny Johnson : Sure. So let me \u2013 so first of all, think of it as a really good financial planning tool. That's cloud-based so can be tied into any platform out there, but we think if you lose them, that's why we filed a patent on it. Because \u2013 so let's say, you have three goals and your goals are, I want to retire. I want to put some money aside for my kids and I want to, if there's enough leftover and I'm doing really well, I'd like to buy that second home on the beach. I must have enough money to retire. It'd be nice if I can help my kids and what the heck I'm rolling the die on that, on that second home. If you think about traditional kind of financial planning models, they \u2013 you'd come up with a portfolio based on your risk and it would be a single portfolio. What goal does is it follows your guide path trajectory to your likelihood of achieving that goal. And if you're doing really well and ahead, it rolls the money down, think of it as a waterfall into your next goal. When you achieve that, it rolls it down into your final goal or however many you have. And if you think about how you structure those portfolios, they're very different. You're not going to get the second home unless you stay high octane all out. But your glide path on retirement, as you're getting older and closer, you're going to want to be more conservative. So it adds that dimension. We worked with the universities on doing it. I have to tell you, we \u2013 our data analytics team came up with it, sort of AI team came up with it. We pitched the idea, they were a little skeptical. And when they looked at the data, they said, does this really work? And so it has resonated very well as we've shown, because it's a very simple sort of way to think about and it resonates with clients well, because you're not talking about benchmarks and things. You're talking about things that absolutely need something to them. And we built it with easy APIs to connect into various platforms. And we find global demand where we are talking to a firm in China who are interested in it. So we see in Asia, Europe, and it's just really resonated well with our platform. Robert Lee : And would I be correct in assuming this is less about it being a source of incremental revenue and it's all that kind of driving in an assumed private demand for your own products and shrinking as relationships\u2026 Jenny Johnson : Right. We do have the choice of either closed architecture, all our products are an open architecture. I think that some fee, if we \u2013 for the assets that are open architecture but it just depends. And we can be flexible with that, but yes, it's a way to create a solution-based sale of our investment case. And as Adam's point, I mean, we really view ourselves as a \u2013 we're an investment manager, we're fundamental across all different types of investment capabilities you want to deliver it in whatever way in which our clients want to receive it. So vehicle agnostic whether a traditional mutual fund, CIT, SMA, ETF or in a solutions-based kind of model portfolio like they\u2019ll provide or we'll build them individually for our distributors. Robert Lee : Maybe a follow-up, just kind of connecting the ETF and ESG, I mean, you've talked a lot about sort of ESG capabilities and if you look in the marketplace early in U.S., seems like it's through the ETFs product that a lot of investors have initially kind of been trying to capture their exposure. So you kind of talk about how, where your own plans are for \u2013 you now have about probability of AUM, but how you're thinking of and then trying to drive ETF growth through ESG or is there like this within product launch ahead of us, just trying to get a feel for how those two connect for you? Jenny Johnson : Yes. I think it's fair to say that there are a set of financial advisors that just like to sell ETF and you don't have a product in that category. You're not going to resonate with those financial advisors. And so we are focused on being able to provide kind of flexibility or whatever the vehicles are. Our 12 million, our largest category is active or second I think is smart beta. And the third is passive. Although, our country ETFs, we're starting to get traction, they're low price, but they're significantly \u2013 they're here somewhere between 40 and 60 basis points than their competitive country. They've been small, but as we get more traction, we'll think we'll even pick up more on the institutional side. Matt, did you want to add anything to that? I don't know if you are\u2026 Matthew Nicholls : I like to add one thing to that, Jenny. And that said, we think of an ETF and I think this is different than some as a way to offer a different vehicle to clients, not a specific investment strategy. So just to put a little more data behind what Jenny said about $12 billion, roughly six of it is active. Three of it is smart beta, and only three of it is market assets weighted passive. That's a little different than some others and I think that guide our growth in the future. Robert Lee : Okay. And maybe one last quick one for Matt, performance fees, $25 million and change this quarter, of course, always difficult to predict but any guidance you can give on how we should think of where you sit now, how should think about kind of roll in the next couple of quarters. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I do think it was seasonably quite high for us in this quarter. So I think you could expect it to be a bit lower next quarter, maybe $10 million is a good estimate and then rising again at the end of the year back to say, $20 million. And then because of the arrangement with Clarion, our performance fees in 2022 will become larger again because we end up getting a larger share of those performance fees. Robert Lee : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Thanks for take my questions. Matthew Nicholls : Sure. Sorry, just before we start next question, I just wanted to address the SMA question because we got the answer to that. So I think it was Mike Cyprys had the question. So the average fee is in the mid-30s to the SMAs and the life that you're asking about is between six and eight years. So it\u2019s lower fee, but we generally hold them for longer periods. So, that's why it's a very good business for us. Just wanted to make sure we answer that question. Operator : And your final question from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions today. So Matt, just one for you, just going back to the fiscal 2021 expense guide. I think the last quarter, you sort of felt it at 3.7 was a pretty firm number, regardless of market action. I may be paraphrasing. Is that still the case because I heard 3.7, 3.75 and I appreciate some moving parts on the competent G&A line, but is 3.7 still the anchor number or is there some, no upside to that? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, so Bill, thank you for the question. So I said 3.7 billion as long as the market increase was within the sort of the low single \u2013 low to mid single-digits. Honestly, we've gone quite considerably above that which does put some pressure on the increasing compensation. As I mentioned for the second quarter, we can expect compensation line to go up by 2% to 3%. But then that should come down again based on the expense discipline that we've communicated so 1% to 2% down, in the third quarter, another 4% down, in the fourth quarter, all else remain equals that's it the as per the management stat, that's sort of roughly the levels they're at today. So I'd say that on all the other line items, it's very little change. I think if anything, we're finding ways to create more expense opportunities to bring expenses down as I communicated a moment ago. But I think that the 3.7 billion mostly as a function of the markets being up in the high single-digits to double-digits is \u2013 low double-digits is leading us to guide a little bit higher than the 3.7 billion to 3.75 billion. If it comes back down again and it'll be 3.7 billion, but that's the range. We're trying to keep that as tight as possible as also communicated. Bill Katz : Okay, perfect. Thank you for the clarification. And then Jenny, just one for you, just as just sort of been talking through a lot of the cross sell momentum. Do you think at the big picture level now, Franklin is where they need to be in terms of its footprint. I guess, more specifically, is there any sort of appetite for M&A and if so, what or where you might be thinking about filling in any residual gaps? Jenny Johnson : So I would say that look, first and foremost, you're going to catch this ball. You're going to make sure that the four deals that we did last year are well-integrated and that is absolutely our focus and we're laser focused on that. Now having said that we feel really good with where they are, that the two acquisitions by Fiduciary Trust test already are getting flows. Surprised at how quickly they worked out. We feel very good with Legg Mason and it was a technology when they were pretty independent. So the first focus is just making sure those continue to do well. Having said that, we've said that we will continue to grow. We want to double our size of a Fiduciary Trust. So as opportunities come up, I think we do some smaller bolt-on acquisitions there. We'd love to continue to expand in the alternative space. If something made sense there, that's just a hard space to acquire. And we think that FinTech is disrupting traditional distribution. So you'll see us continuing to make investments, whether they're acquisitions, it just has to be the right one, but we'll certainly make investments in places where we think there's greater distribution opportunity with some FinTech investments. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, it's I would just add to Jenny's point about alternatives. It's difficult to find the exact right one for us given the breadth of the alternatives we have, but they're all \u2013 quite a few out there that we've met that we think would be a great fit for our firm and a great fit for alternative asset strategy. We have revenues in the alternative asset space of over $550 million or something like that for the year. And we would absolutely like to grow that and we see plenty of opportunities out there. It's a matter of timing and finding the right one that fits with the rest of the pieces we've already got. Bill Katz : Thank you very much. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : And I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to CEO, Jenny Johnson for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Great. Well, thank you everyone for participating in today's call, we're really proud of what we've been able to achieve in this truly unique environment. And we are excited to see the opportunities that lie ahead. Once again, I'd like to thank all our employees for their significant efforts, dedication and client focus. We look forward to speaking to you all again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Franklin Resources Earnings Conference Call, for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2021. My name is Denise, and I will be your call operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations, for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss your quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factors and the MD&A section of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filing. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's second quarter results. Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman, Matt Nicholls, our CFO and Adam Spector are Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everyone is well. We continue to operate our business effectively with over 95% of our employees working from home. Broadly speaking, we're planning for a return to office in September. Though our approach will be flexible and shaped by local requirements and the status of the pandemic in the countries where we do business. We are encouraged by the number of vaccines that are now being distributed worldwide. The rollout rates obviously vary by country, the progress is very promising. Having said that, we have been deeply concerned by the suffering that has resulted from the surge in cases in India and other parts of the world. Our thoughts go out to our employees and clients who have been personally impacted by this terrible disease. Turning now to our second fiscal quarter. Today, we are pleased to report financial results that reflect our continued progress with revenue growth and margin expansion, resulting in a 6% increase in adjusted operating income to $581 million. Our financial flexibility remains strong, with cash and investments of $6.2 billion at March 31, net of $250 million of debt paid down in the quarter. After only two quarters as a combined company, we're experiencing organic growth in a number of key areas. We're now in more robust and diversified active management business and we're encouraged and excited by our collective potential. Our merger has created a differentiated global firm, which balances scale and specialization and which we believe offers expanded opportunities for our stockholders, clients and employees as well as the financial professionals with whom we partner. Turning to performance, we're seeing an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies from the prior quarter. More than two-thirds of our strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks for the four key time periods. And number of our mutual funds rated four or five stars by Morningstar increased to over 140 funds this quarter. Turning next to distribution highlights. We're encouraged by the positive results of our new sales initiatives and efforts to deepen relationships. More clients purchase both Legacy Franklin Templeton and the Legacy Legg Mason strategies as demonstrated by our merger wins during this quarter. Our expanded distribution efforts drove an increase in gross sales of 32% from the prior quarter across a broad array of funds, vehicles and asset classes, led by U.S. retail. Long-term inflows increased by $15.9 billion or 19% quarter-over-quarter to $99.4 billion excluding reinvested distribution. Second quarter long-term net outflows improved to $4.2 billion compared to $4.5 billion in the prior quarter. Importantly, if you exclude reinvest in distribution, net outflows improved by over $10 billion. Our sales momentum continued with positive net flows in the Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust International, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Martin Currie, Royce and Western Asset. As we said on previous calls, the firm has been focused on expanding our alternatives platform. And this quarter we did. Alternative strategies grew by $4 billion to $131 billion in assets under management, with contributions from real estate, private credit and retail alternatives. Clarion partners and Benefit Street Partners both reached record AUM levels, and K2 alternative strategies also contributed to positive net flows. Fixed Income inflows increased by 27% to $53.5 billion from the prior quarter due to positive contributions from a diverse group of fixed income strategies, including core bond, core plus, and corporate. We are pleased that Western Asset experienced net inflows of almost $10 billion in the quarter, its highest level in over a decade. Equity inflows were $32.4 billion consistent with the prior quarter excluding reinvested distributions. We continue to see strong interest in our thematic equity strategies. And while still early days, we're seeing progress and increased interest in our value strategies. As of this quarter end, our institutional pipeline has increased with a combined total of one but unfunded mandates of $13 billion, and it's diversified across all asset classes. Aside from our specific results for the quarter, we are also pleased to release our corporate social responsibility report in April. We establish clear goals and priorities for fiscal year 2021. ESG investing is key among them. And we continue to make important strides to keep our diverse inclusion efforts at the forefront. Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to thank our outstanding teams around the globe that continue to do extraordinary work every day on behalf of our clients and firm. And they've done so this past year under challenging circumstances. I am grateful for everything they do. Now your questions, operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Dan Fannon, with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. My questions on flows and just kind of the momentum if you look at the backlog, which continues to grow, can you talk about the difference in the backlog this quarter versus last? And then also on the strength and alternatives if you could talk about the fundraising if it's evergreen or ongoing or if there was some kind of specific closes that maybe drove business strength in this past quarter? Adam Spector : Sure. I'll take that. It's Adam here. Thanks for the question. If you think about what's happening now and how flows are changing, the good news is that they're becoming far more diversified, which is actually what we've been planning to do. So we're seeing good flows, equity fix, alternatives, as well as in our solutions business and geographically diverse as well. The U.S. remains by far the largest driver of flows, but we're seeing very good flows in Europe and the Americas as well. In terms of alternatives, I'd say two things happen there. At the top end of the market, we saw really healthy subscriptions into Clarion, K2 and others from the institutional market. But we are also really trying to address the democratization of alternatives, and had some very healthy raises for BSP and others in the wires. And that's something that I think will continue throughout this year as we have other retail launches for other alternative products throughout our system. Dan Fannon : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Hawkins with UBS. Your line is open. Adam Beatty : Hi, good morning. And thank you, this is Adam Beatty in for Brandon. Just want to ask about some of the exchanges from equity into multi asset, it seem like that had a bit of an effect in the quarter. And just the trend you were seeing throughout the quarter, maybe the trajectory, do you expect a little bit more of that, given where the markets have been? And is there anything in terms of maybe a poll on the multi asset side that, either through marketing or distribution where you're kind of accelerating that movement in some way? Thank you. So Jenny Johnson : Sure, let me address that in two parts. First of all, in terms of the exchange, that is more of a one-time thing where we have essentially reclassified and tweaked how we manage an existing funds. So that caused a reclassification. So that's an accurate change for this quarter, but not something that you should see happening quarter-over-quarter. In terms of solutions in general, though, that has become a focus. What we see at our largest distribution partners is that there is a focus on having their advisors focus more on asset gathering and less on portfolio management, which means that the management teams that our biggest partners are really looking to firms like Franklin, that our full service offer active sleeves across the entire suite to provide models and solutions. And that's where we're seeing significant pickup in our solutions business and one imagine that would continue throughout the year. Adam Beatty : Great, thanks for broadening the answer. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Jeff Dresdner [ph] on for Rob. Quick question for in regards to gross sales for fixed income. There's a large step up there. But then there was a bit of a sharper drop in equity gross sales. I wonder if you can provide any color and some of your peers have been showing some more demand on the equity side. Jenny Johnson : Yes, we're seeing good demand in fixed income and in equity, in fixed income. Western just had an absolutely fabulous quarter. And I think that's what drove a lot of the top line on fixed income. From an equity standpoint, the great news is that with value coming back in the marketplace from a return perspective, we feel that we are quite well balanced in terms of our exposure to value and growth. The majority of our inflows and equities continue to be on the growth side. And things like Dynatech, ClearBridge is large cap growth. But we have very strong product on the value side. And we're starting to see a pickup there as well. Matthew Nicholls : Also, if you execute reinvested distributions from the chart, the sales are about flat. And in fact, the net flows improved into equities when you exclude reinvested distributions. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And if I could just quickly follow with one more. Just in terms with capital management. Maybe your thoughts on acquiring additional high net worth businesses, and maybe just a general outlook on the acquisition? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, I mean. Okay, Jenny, go ahead. Jenny Johnson : We've stated that we want to continue to grow, Fiduciary Trust, and as we're looking at that those potential acquisitions, we're usually looking not only for assets and expanding our distribution there, but geographic benefit, maybe in a location that we're not located as well as capability. So as the last two, with Peno [ph] we got really a top ESG Manager and 10 trust with a special needs trust. So it is still an area of focus for us and we will continue to look to acquire there. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Worthington, with JP Morgan, your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. The Biden administration has proposed higher dividend and capital gains taxes for the high net worth. If these proposals go through, do you think they could or would have an influence on your business? Either the types of products that are sold or the distribution channels through which they're sold? Thanks. Jenny Johnson : So, we look at ourselves, as a firm, our expertise is our investment management capability. We want to be flexible in delivering that expertise in whatever vehicle our clients would like to receive it in. So, that can be a mutual fund, that can be an ETF, a CIT, a separately managed account. So there's no question that there's a lot of discussion out there, that the mutual fund has some tax inefficiencies that an ETF doesn't have, and that there is the potential to see a shift there. However, you were probably already seeing a bit of that shift, as many fee-based advisors prefer the ETF vehicle. So we want to - if that happens, you're likely to continue to see an acceleration in that shift. What we have been hearing for last couple of years from our distributors is you need to be able to package all of your products in any of these vehicles and be agnostic to it so that you can meet the demands of our varying distribution groups. Matthew Nicholls : And what I would add to that, Jenny is that, we believe we'll see increased demand for our Muni [ph] capabilities, where we have a really strong capability of both Franklin Templeton fixed income, as well as at Western. And in general, as taxes taken larger bite of the apple, active management becomes more and more important, which we think is in our favor as well. Ken Worthington : And Jenny, you mentioned the ETF wrapper, since you guys control presidium? Is that something that you're seeing benefit them in terms of either leads or new business inquiries, any flavor there? Jenny Johnson : So I think it's the jury's still out a little bit on whether people want a true kind of blind trust for their active management capabilities. I think there's a view that many of the products it's okay to have some transparency even on the active side. We do certainly, and certainly in fixed income. But I think there are some you take a small cap strategy; you're going to need to have that in some kind of blind trust and an ETF. So I think that presidium has the opportunity to benefit. But I don't think that it will be at the level maybe what it was launched, where people thought it would that all active ETFs would be in that kind of packaging for an ETF. Ken Worthington : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is actually Shawn Kalman [ph] on for Mike. Can you guys update us on your distribution efforts are placing Legacy Legg Mason products into retail products? And did that have a major impact on the improved gross flows in the quarter? Matthew Nicholls : Sure. One of the two things that I think we need to be successful is cross selling, the others getting our generalist specialist model. So from a cross selling perspective, if you take a look at the two organizations, premerger, Franklin had much more of a strength in the regional broker dealer channel lag was a little stronger in the wires, there were some geographic differences as well. One of our major efforts is to make sure that we take advantage of that complimentary nature of the two businesses. So if you take a look at what's happened so far year-to-date, we've crossed sold to about 5000 new advisors, advisors who either owned only Legacy Franklin and bought Legacy Legg product or vice versa. And that cross selling is having a pretty significant impact. Another way to look at that geographically, is to think about the presence that say Franklin had in Canada, or the Americas or where was a little lighter. We're now at about 25% ahead of last year sales in those regions for Legacy Legg Mason. So yes, kind of that cross selling that's had a significant impact. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Sherry [ph] filling in for Alex. My question is on the expense guide. In the commentary you mentioned as to subject to market conditions. So just wanted to get a sense as to what are the market assumptions and flows estimates that you have taken into consideration for the rest of the year. Matthew Nicholls : So in terms of the market, we're assuming a flat market, we don't make any additional market overlay assumptions in our guidance. In terms of the flow trajectory, we're assuming something similar to what we've been experiencing and the improvements that we've been experiencing over the last two quarters. So that's why our guidance remains consistent with what we described last quarter. What's pushed it up slightly in terms of the we mentioned $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion for adjusted expenses was push that up slightly as is the obviously the continued momentum in the market. But also our performance has improved our flow to improve and our results have improved. So by definition that does have an upward pressure on compensation in particular, but we have other offsets in our cost structure on in that regard. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, just to follow-up on that. So assuming that this flow territory and the markets continue to grind higher, what's the sensitivity of this guide kind of go up for the rest of the year? Matthew Nicholls : I think we fit for the third quarter we feel good about the continued 3.75 to 3.8. We're provide further guidance for the fourth quarter and 2022 when we reach that point. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you so much. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Just wanted to talk about the fixed income business broadly, obviously, when we get, when we tend to have a backup and yields were rising long-term yield environment. On retail bond funds, that tends to cause at least a temporary downdraft or a spike up and redemption sometimes as the NAV, the NAVs get hit on that. But, can you talk about, for the institutional side, it can be a different dynamic. So can you talk about what clients are saying about that or what are their concerns about that, or what you perceive as client demand, if we do have a spike up in yield for Western? Would you see a temporary sort of elevated redemptions on that? Or do you think that's actually positive for long-term? Jenny Johnson : I mean, in particular on the institutional side, I mean, let's face it, pensions, insurance companies, they need fixed income as part of our portfolio, both from a cash flow perspective, as well potentially dampen volatility. So, we have about 43% of our AUM and fixed income, and there are multiple fixed income franchises within Franklin Templeton, and they all manage differently. So we go anywhere from treasuries, obviously, the private credit with a BSP. So they all manage differently. With a rising rate environment, obviously, you're going to have an impact on the duration component of the fixed income portfolio. But if you take Western, for example, only 4% of their AUM is actually in government bonds. So, the rest of it they're doing, they're managing across sectors, bank loan, high yield, emerging markets. And if you have a rising rate environment, chances are that's a better economy, economic environment, and chances are those the credit component and the sector component outperform. So when you look at, we actually did a study at Western and look back to 2000, and there were 30 times where you had a significant short term, or a significant period of rate increase, which defined by greater than 15 basis points in a month and was extended, and in that Western tended to underperform in the short term, but then significantly outperform in six, nine and 12 months, because what ended up and that's versus obviously, benchmark and peers, and that's because the credit sector component kicked in on the performance. So institutional clients understand that and are willing to kind of work through at least that's been our experience. Matthew Nicholls : And the other thing I would add is that as rates rise, we would expect to see some money coming out of lower fee cash and very ultra-short products into more core products, which will have a positive impact for us. Brian Bedell : That's great. If I can sneak in another one on those the Schwab Advisor engine platform integration with Schwab Advisors, that you mentioned, any view on how that might impact the sales trend through the Schwab Advisor network going forward from where it's been? Jenny Johnson : Our strategy is to - as the world has moved on the on the retail side to more of a fee-based environment with somewhere between 75 about 75% flows kind of go in that direction. It has pushed because there's obviously transparencies and what the client is paying the advisor, push the advisor to be more of a wealth manager. So our goal is to provide additional tools beyond just investment capabilities to help that advisor be a wealth manager deepens the relationship to that. So in the case of advisor engine, there are tools within advisor engine, and it may be as simple as the CRM system juncture that an advisor that's sitting on the Schwab platform, and gusting on the Schwab platform may want to use some of those tools for some of the clients or all their clients, and they won't use it unless you have integrated to the custody level. So, it remains to be seen how that plays out. But that's essentially, our goal is to just make it as easy for a financial advisor to do business with us, and to provide those additional types of services. That for example, like go which ends up providing goals-based investment models, so that you deepen the relationships and hopefully stick your assets with the advisors. Brian Bedell : It's great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research, your line is open. Patrick Davitt : The last few, you answered all my questions. Thank you. I'm good. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my questions. This is actually Kareem Afifi [ph] filling in for Craig. My first question is on flows. I was wondering if you could expand on the reason behind the $6 billion fixed income institutional redemption. Was it performance related, or did the client want to move the money in house? And also, does this particular client have other mandates with Franklin Templeton? Thank you. Adam Spector : Why clients make particular moves, I think you never quite know. I would say, in general, with some large sovereign institutions, we do see a trend to in-source some places, I think this was just not the right mandate for them at the right time. That client still does have significant assets with us as an institution. And we feel solid with the overall relationship, we just happen to lose one piece of the overall relationship there, a lot of money, but only a portion of our overall relationship. Unidentified Analyst : Got it? Thank you very much. And if I could sneak one more, can you maybe comment on the sustainability of retail flows, given the large government stimulus and strong equity market, which may be making current activity levels unsustainable. Adam Spector : I can only tell you what we're doing, not what the government is going to do from a stimulus policy. And I'm feeling really confident about what we're doing in sales. We post-merger really brought the best of the two firms together; we feel really confident in the field force we have out there. We've got folks in new territories now for six months, we're seeing the results of that interaction. We've put a specialist generalist model in place. And I see no abatement in terms of the activity we're having the level of engagement we're having, and feel really, really good about where we are from flows. If you look at us retail, it's by far the largest segment of our overall business. It's the place we've put the most attention, post-merger to make sure we get the integration, right. And we're seeing huge benefits from it. So I'm feeling pretty good about the future. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Stephanie [ph] filling in for Mike. My question is around the fee rate, given the improvement in performance fees this quarter, do you think the outlook for generating performance fees has improved into the rest of the year? And then just any help on how we should think about the fee rate exiting the quarter and trending from here? Matthew Nicholls : I mean, look, the fee rate this quarter was supported by a couple of quite large low fee redemptions, we had growth in alternatives, we had good support in equities. So it's solidified, where the current rate is, we feel quite good for the year to say that the high end of our guidance at 38 basis points, potentially 38 to 39 basis points, is the right way to model that for the entire year. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. And then just one quick one on cryptocurrencies. Do you see a commercial opportunity in crypto? If so, how are you approaching the opportunity from types of products or investments that you might be considering? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : So I'm not a not a huge fan of things like Bitcoin, because I think over time, government crypto got so big, governments would want to step in and regulate because they like to control their currency. So I'll put that sort of out there first. That is not to be confused with tokenization, both of assets because I think that that will unlock illiquid assets that become interesting and also tokenized coins that help facilitate business models. And that's different there's nothing backing a Bitcoin but there is something backing a coin that actually has a functional capabilities. So I think there's a lot of education that's going to happened out there around tokenization. And I do think that blockchain will completely change sort of how this how our industry how the financial services industry operates their back office, I think it has, as I said, has the real capability of democratizing illiquid assets, that some would argue might even take some of the premium out of alternative space over a long period of time. But that that would be my answer to that question. Matthew Nicholls : I just add one of the things on the wealth side, having the capability to field let's call it digital assets in general, is going to probably be important for the future. So we are focused on the capability front in that regard. Unidentified Analyst : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank, your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. It's on ESG, you have been some detail in the commentary on that. Just wanted to see if you're able to assess what the flows were into ESG dedicated products, or what you call a specific focus for the quarter, and then the $175 billion that you mentioned, with specific focus. Just wanted to cool in on that a little bit. I think like Mason's if I'm not mistaken is the bigger part of that. Not sure, if you can go into some color on some of the bigger parts of that 175 that you're including in that, that doesn't include any exclusionary product, for example. Jenny Johnson : So let me give you my little spiel on ESG, why Adam looks up a little more detail on the actual flows, in some of those. So first of all, we would you know, 93% of our AUM has ESG factors. And when we think it's here to stay, we don't think anybody could be an active manager, without ESG and all of our investment teams incorporate ESG factors into their investment process. And we think that one of the reasons we're so far along in that is one as an active manager, we think that the data out there is not particularly good. And it requires engagement by investment teams with companies to actually gather the data. And number two, having a large presence in both Europe and Australia, where really these trends kind of started, we had to develop these products way before they became really important in the U.S. And we think that again, despite the industry coalescing around things like SASB and TCFD, right now, it really requires engagement of an active manager to do true ESG kind of screening. When you look at Europe, they have something called Article six, Article eight and Article nine, Article six as you do the screen. So our 93% of our AUM would qualify in that. In article eight, we have 25 products there and article eight is sort have a tilt towards ESG factors and Article nine is really impacting its eight funds there. We are seeing good flows into our two Paris aligned climate ETFs. Our European total return and our Templeton global climate are both reaching a billion dollars, good flows into our social infrastructure fund, ClearBridge, U.S. Equity sustainability fund has been in net sales for the last 12 months. So that's a little bit of your question, we're seeing flows in a broad set of products. And what's interesting, I think you're seeing is this supply side of ESG is really increasing, as you hear like Europe, one-third of their COVID relief fund will go into green bonds, which is doubling the size of the market, obviously, with the Biden infrastructure. That gets passed, you're going to see increase there. And so it'll be a lot more supply, which will continue to drive this. And Adam, I don't know if you want to add any additional details to that. Adam Spector : I think Jenny, you hit on all the high points, I would just say that the great thing about our ESG capabilities is that yes, we have it in the traditional asset classes, equities, fixed incomes, but also in solutions and alternatives. And in alternatives in places like K2, Clarion, et cetera, where we're also seeing significant flows. And I think that combination of ESG and also is going to be a real winner for us. Brian Bedell : That's super helpful. In fact, if I just back out the one-time redemption of the 6 billion in the MDA funds, we would have about $3 billion of positive flows for the quarter. It is fair to say, ESG funds would have driven on a net basis, significant portion of that, positive three? Adam Spector : I don't think we know the answer to that. But you're right on 3.4, though. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. That ends our Q&A session; I would like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, everybody, for participating in today's call. Through the work that we've done over the past year, we built a really truly differentiated investment firm, and our progress highlights why we are more confident than ever about our future. Once again, I'd like to thank all our employees for their significant efforts, dedication and client focus. And we look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. So thank you, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn your conference to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our third fiscal quarter. Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; Matt Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everybody is doing well.  This past Saturday marked 1 year since we closed on our landmark acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. As we stated at the time, this is a growth story for our firm and our focus continues to be on delivering strong investment results for our valued clients. This commitment has been our North Star throughout the past year. Over the past 12 months, through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've made significant strides bringing together the 2 firms and executing on our growth strategy. We have created a diversified business across asset class, vehicle, client type and region and we're well positioned in key growth areas where there is client demand, including alternatives, fixed income, SMAs and ESG investing.  Early on, we redesigned a nimbler and more adaptable distribution model with a more region-centric sales approach, pushing our decision-making and resources closer to our clients, and the positive momentum we're seeing around sales flows shows that what we're doing is working. Our sales initiatives are resulting in deeper relationships and increased diversification in flows across funds, vehicles and asset classes. These factors have led to significant improvement in total net flows since the time of the acquisition.  Our combined sales team has been actively cross-selling. In the U.S. alone, almost 6,000 financial advisers have deepened their relationships with Franklin Templeton through enhanced access to newly introduced capabilities. Specifically, this progress has led to growth in key areas of the business. Since the acquisition, we've grown alternatives by 15%, wealth management by 22% and SMAs by 25%. Above all else, we've been incredibly aligned in terms of culture and our focus on delivering strong investment results. Our efforts this past year have translated into a better, stronger Franklin Templeton.  Turning now to our third fiscal quarter where our momentum has been building. Ending assets under management reached a record high of $1.55 trillion this quarter, and investment performance continues to strengthen across a broad array of investment strategies. Overall, results continue to reflect outperformance in fixed income, including Western Asset and Brandywine Global alternative asset strategies and global and international equity strategies across Franklin Templeton equities. Mutual funds with 4 or 5 star ratings by Morningstar increased to over 150 funds this quarter. Turning next to distribution highlights. We saw positive net flows into the majority of our specialist investment managers and Benefit Street Partners, Clarion, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust International, and Martin Currie, all reached record highs in assets under management. We were pleased to see a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to alternatives, and also that our fixed income net inflows returned to positive territory at $2.1 billion. We made progress diversifying our net flows across funds, vehicles and asset classes during the quarter, scaling smaller products and creating broader sources of revenue. For example, 15 of our top 20 funds with positive flows or products outside of our largest 20 funds, and each have an average AUM of less than $2 billion. In the U.S., our collective sales initiatives are yielding positive results with net flows during the quarter. Specifically, we saw net flows into U.S. retail, which is our largest distribution opportunity and in global financial institutions, our largest client opportunity. On the product development front, we launched the $1 billion pre-leverage Western Asset Diversified Income Fund. This was our largest ever fixed income closed-end fund IPO and illustrates the successful partnering of our SIMs investment capabilities with the combined reach of our distribution platform. Additional recent strategic developments include : the close of the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high yield-focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds in July, adding $3.4 billion to assets under management; and the announcement of a merger of Benefit Street Partners Realty Trust with Capstead Mortgage Corporation, which will create the fourth largest publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT upon closing.  Looking at our financial results. Our adjusted operating income increased by 3% to $601.2 million from the prior quarter, inclusive of the onetime impact of costs associated with the successful launch of the Western Asset closed-end fund that I just mentioned. And with $6.4 billion in cash and investments, the ongoing strength of our balance sheet enables us to invest with confidence in the business and make sure we're best positioned to be a leader in an ever-evolving industry. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts this past year working under extraordinary circumstances. I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish on behalf of our clients. Now to your questions, operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : My first question is on the $5 billion 529 redemption. Do you know if that will flow through the mutual funds? Or is it in more of an institutional wrap or -- because the mutual fund flow data we can see suggests a fairly significant outflow in July. I'm just wondering if that's what it's associated with. Adam Spector : Yes. Thanks for that question. That is in the mutual fund flows. Those were mutual funds that were in that program. Patrick Davitt : Great. And then on the drivers of the expense guide, you mentioned it being driven by the close-end fund launch costs and the performance fee comp, but that would suggest an 80% comp ratio on the performance fee, which seems quite high. So is there something else driving the increase? Or was it right to think about the performance fee comp ratio being that high? Matthew Nicholls : No. I think that we also had a little rise in other compensation associated with strong performance in other areas of the firm, but most of it was the performance fee-related compensation. And maybe we should take offline the 80%. I think it's a lot less than that the -- it's more like -- much less than that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I guess just to follow up a bit on just performance fees, and I know these are difficult to predict, but this was the largest quarter from you, I think, in history. And so I think the prepared remarks said something about a diverse set of the contribution. So can you talk about kind of where the performance fees came from? And then looking ahead, how we should generally think about this quarter vis-a-vis what might be in the future, just given the limited disclosures around the funds? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So a couple of things there. First of all, I'd say that about 70% of the performance fees are attributed to our largest alternative asset management, specialized investment managers. So that's attributed to Clarion and Benefit Street Partners. Two, though, the rest of it comes from a fairly diversified group that represents about half of our specialized investment managers. So it's a very diversified group of specialized investment managers that have been outperforming that have produced the performance fees.  While -- and then to the second part of your question, how should we put this into context, this quarter versus future quarters. I think it's important to note that while it reflects the growth of our alternative asset business in particular. This quarter did include 2 quite large episodic performance fees that occurred at the same time. In one instance, we had several funds cleared the performance hurdles and became eligible for carried interest distributions, which had accumulated over several years. It's about 4 years actually.  In the other, a significant tranche of invested capital became eligible for a long-dated performance fee, and this fund had significant investment performance over the management period, which resulted in a large performance fee. So for this combination of events and timing along with the performance fees at over half of the other specialized investment managers resulted in this elevation of performance fees or elevated performance fee levels. So I would repeat our guidance on performance fees of $10 million per quarter. I think you'll agree that sounds quite low, but we think it's best to be conservative around performance fees, but we do acknowledge that's conservative. Daniel Fannon : Okay. That's helpful. And then just generally on alternatives, given the strength in flows in the quarter. Can you talk about just kind of the fundraising environment today, kind of the runway you see for growth here and where the potential biggest contributors for that asset class at the manager level could come from? Adam Spector : Yes. There are a few things that are really working for us and alternatives. One is just the quality of firms that we have. We think it's -- they're strong in their individual asset classes, and we're in a number of different alternative areas from real estate to private debt, private equity to hedge funds. We also have an advantage of being able to raise money for alternatives in a geographically diverse base. We're seeing growth around the world and our alternatives. It's not just U.S. flows. A number of our alternatives have an ESG component to them, especially in real estate. And so that combination of ESG and alternatives is resonating, I think, quite strongly.  And finally, from the alternative side, I'd say we spent a lot of time concentrating on how to democratize access to alternatives to make sure it's not just institutions in the ultra-high net worth segment that can access alternatives. And we're raising money in retail as well. All of that, to me, speaks to the ability to have continued strong momentum in fundraising there. Jennifer Johnson : And let me just add, Adam, is a lot of discussion about the democratization of alternatives, our experience. And I think we probably have one of the strongest retail franchise is -- it is complicated to sell in a retail franchise, and it is an area of serious focus for us for figuring out how to do it, and we've had some success in it.  And then if you think about our great -- our biggest alternative managers with Clarion and BSP, both are income-generating. And that fits very well in the retail space. So it's a matter of educating the advisers on it and getting the brand name out there. But having the relationships that we have, we think that, that's just a huge upside opportunity for us there. Matthew Nicholls : It's also good to put alternatives generally into perspective in terms of where we've come and where we are. About 2.5 years ago, we had about $18 billion in alternative assets under management, and we now have $141 billion under management. Obviously, in that contains 2 large acquisitions, the Benefit Street Partners and Clarion, but it also includes an embedded 15%, at least, organic growth rate over that period. So it's both acquisitions and making opportunities work in terms of organic growth. Adam Spector : And the final thing I would add is that we're continuing to add resources to distribution there. And it was only last quarter that we started a specialized sales group to focus just on alternatives in the U.S., and we're seeing traction from that already. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Samantha Trent : This is Samantha Trent on for Ken Worthington. So our first question is just on the equity fund on these equity fund redemptions that were called out this quarter. You highlighted that these assets generate very little in revenue. Could you just kind of give us an indication on how much an equity asset spring from manages that generate little, if any, revenue? And is this a good business? And what do you see as the outlook for these low-fee assets? Jennifer Johnson : I don't know that we -- if I try to think through it, I mean, you obviously -- you have things like smart beta and passive, obviously, are lower that we have those primarily in our ETFs. If you look at our $13 billion in ETFs, 50% of it's active. So those aren't low fees. But obviously, the path is lower. I'm just trying to -- I'm stalling a little bit because I'm trying to think through any obvious, big chunky -- which I don't -- I can't think of any off the top of my head. These were kind of unique relationships that honestly we had acquired years ago with kind of local managers, smaller managers that had lower fees. Samantha Trent : Okay. And then just one more. You mentioned in the commentary that Franklin added a number of new agreements with distribution partners. Maybe just kind of talk about the nature of these agreements, and are you trying to make these more -- making its way to work with third list with the distribution partners? And then also just talk about how the cost of these compare with your existing distribution agreement. Adam Spector : Sure. I don't think there's a real change in cost of distribution. What I would highlight is that the added agreements are really a direct result of a concerted effort to cross-sell. So a lot of those additional agreements are onboarding legacy Legg Mason products to Franklin agreements or vice versa. And we've done both.  One of the statistics we've called out is that we've cross-sold to about 6,000 new advisers in the U.S. that is advisers who used to do business with only legacy Franklin or legacy Legg Mason. We're able to do that because we're taking on more agreements and putting products on -- more products on broad platforms. We also see a real geographic benefit to taking those new platforms on. If you think about Europe, as an example, in EMEA, where Franklin historically had a stronger distribution footprint, about 15% of our AUM is legacy Legg Mason in terms of retail distribution, but it's about 30% of the flow. So getting products onto those platforms has had a real immediate benefit to us. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : You referenced the enhancements to customization capabilities within your SMA offering. Can you speak to where you are today with that customization and those capabilities and whether or not that presents a possible revenue opportunity within that channel? And what investments you want to make to enhance that offering and further execute that opportunity? Jennifer Johnson : Let me start, and then Adam can add to it. About 10% of our SMA business today is already very much customized, whether it's tax harvesting or individual tilts that clients want. And we just believe fundamentally with technology, fintech, fractionalization of shares that this customization of individual accounts is going to become more and more important, whether it's for things like tax harvesting or things like ESG tilt. The clients are demanding that kind of customization or for it to just fit into a portfolio.  Now Fiduciary Trust is a high network manager that's been -- I think we're going to celebrate our 90th year this year. That's what they did. I mean if you're a high-net worth manager, oftentimes people come with concentration holdings from a single company that maybe they built, and so you customize the rest of the portfolio around that. So -- and of course, they tend to be a high tax bracket people. So tax management is key to what they do.  What we're seeing, and we've talked about this, is the world has got fee-based is the demand on financial advisers is to provide the type of services that traditionally were just done by high net worth managers like Fiduciary Trust, and bring them much more to the masses. And so we think this trend is here to stay. We have had that capability within our SMA for quite a while. We're continuing to develop it. And I know, Adam, you're closer to the day to day, so if you want to add anything to that? Adam Spector : Yes. I think Jenny really did hit the high points there. It is already 10% of our $125 billion in SMAs. It's continuing to grow, and we're continuing to expand that reach to more folks. What I would say in general about our SMA business is that ClearBridge and Legg Mason historically had an incredibly strong infrastructure in terms of operational and technological platform for the SMA business. We've now been able to use that platform across the business such that about 50% roughly of our net flow into the SMA business is coming from the legacy Franklin investment teams. So really seeing, again, the advantage of using a legacy part of one firm to benefit the entire organization. Brennan Hawken : Yes. I've definitely heard about that success. But is there anything you can add to the revenue opportunity tied to those -- that 10%? Adam Spector : I would say, in general, that when we look at our SMA business, it tends to be very good revenue business because it tends to be stickier in mutual fund business. We have a longer average life, and that has a definite revenue impact. I would also say that to the extent that you customize for a client, over time, that relationship becomes less about quarter-to-quarter performance and more about really meeting the client's overall goals, whether those are ESG goals or tax efficiency goals, which again leads to longer-lived assets which I think has a positive revenue impact. Matthew Nicholls : It's also, Brennan, from a profitability perspective, it's -- even though it's lower fee, it's higher margin business. It costs less to run. Brennan Hawken : Because it exists on the -- that you use the existing infrastructure and so incremental... Matthew Nicholls : Yes, correct. Brennan Hawken : Yes. Okay. And then, Matthew, understanding your commentary about the chunky nature of the performance fees and the $10 million a quarter is probably conservative, which looks pretty clear, especially after the last quarter. But is there a seasonality -- we're kind of getting used to the new business mix here at Franklin. Should we think about a seasonality to the performance fees? And you almost got there to the comp ratio before. But like I usually think about it as more like maybe in the ballpark of like half of that 80% as a reliable ballpark? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Yes, I think that's a good -- I think that's correct, yes. I think it's the way to look at it. I mean I was thinking about Patrick's question. I think the way that we look at it in terms of the increased expenses this quarter versus last quarter is without the performance-related compensation and without the closed-end fund launch costs, we would have been slightly down expenses quarter-over-quarter. So I think that's important. And that allows you to calculate in the roughly 50% or 60% of performance-related compensation. But it really depends, Brennan, on which performance fee and which specialized investment manager, which mandate it is, it's a little bit difficult to generalize. But I think in terms of this quarter, that's the right answer.  In terms of the broader comp ratio, I'll just take advantage of this to give you a quick update for the year -- for the fourth quarter and comparing it to where we're at now. Our comp ratio, as you can see, was 44% for the quarter, which was consistent to the last quarter, and I expect that to be 43% to 44% next quarter. That's consistent with comp and benefits being down by about 5%. So that's the comp and benefits line.  And in terms of information systems and technology, we expect that to be up slightly, probably 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter, and that's driven by outsourcing initiatives, which ultimately were helping compensation reductions next year, even somewhat into the fourth quarter. In terms of occupancy expense, we expect this to remain flat in the fourth quarter, perhaps 1% higher because we're working on some interesting opportunities there that result in slightly higher occupancy expense, but then followed by meaningful reductions in 2022. But for the quarter, about flat to 1% higher. And in G&A, as you know, this quarter was sharply higher because of the closed-end fund launch costs. Without that, G&A would have been flat. In terms of our expense guidance for the fourth quarter, we're assuming at least 50% normal -- let's call it, normalized T&E, which lead to about $125 million of G&A for the fourth quarter? Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. One quick clarification on that question. Is that sequential growth or year-over-year? Matthew Nicholls : Sorry. Brian, which sequential on what? Brian Bedell : On the expense guidance you gave Brennan, is it -- is that sequential growth? Matthew Nicholls : Quarter-over-quarter. So fourth quarter versus third quarter, yes. Brian Bedell : Okay. I asked because I wanted to clarify that. My broader question is on ESG, the $200 billion of AUM that you referenced, that's up from $175 billion in the prior quarter. So if you can talk about what proportion of that was due to net flows into ESG product as compared with any kind of reclassification or funds that have now been recategorized as ESG. And then importantly, of that $200 billion, what would you say is an exclusionary strategy as opposed to direct investments in sustainable investments? Adam Spector : So let me try to tackle that. I don't have the exact details. I would say, in general, when you think about that $200 billion, it's not primarily exclusionary based at all. Instead, I would say if you had to try to categorize it, think about it as more assets that are in line with the European Article 8 or Article 9 definition. That's roughly how we think about what that $200 billion is.  Most of the change there really is due to either market performance or flows because we're seeing very strong flows, especially in Europe. If I take a look at our European assets, I think ESG is going to be key in every single market. Europe is just a little bit ahead right now. I believe that Article 8 and 9 type assets, that $200 billion number, that represents something like 15% of our AUM in the EMEA region, but 30% of our flow and 50% of our pipeline. So it is becoming more and more important. So I think you'll see that number rise over time. Jennifer Johnson : And I would add that we kind of break that category. So we think the way Europe has done it with Article 6, 8, 9 is a good framework to think about it. And we are pleased that we have so many products that qualify against 25 for Article 8, and then 8 strategies for Article 9. But what's really satisfying is that it's diverse across all of our SIMs. We kind of put it into 4 categories, thematics, tilted, value -- values can be things like Shariah and sukuk funds -- and then impact. And we're talking Clarion and Martin Currie, Franklin, Western. So really across all of our different SIMs, we have funds that fit into these 8, 9 categories, which is really good, we think, from just positioning. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe a follow-on on that. The institutional versus retail breakdown. Is it -- would you classify this more as retail products that are getting designated the Article 8 and 9? And you also mentioned customized SMAs, I think earlier in response to another question about, if you will be -- clients being able to customize ESG considerations into the SMAs. So maybe if you can just talk about how significant that is. Adam Spector : Yes. I would say in that 200, the customized SMA is not a huge part of that number because a lot of that customization is really tax loss harvesting. So I don't think that's a huge part of that number. Institutionally, we are seeing significant demand for ESG. And I think in certain markets in Europe, in Australia, it's hard to win any new institutional mandates unless you have ESG integration. So I see that as a theme across both retail and institutional. Brian Bedell : Got it. And then just lastly for the flow number that you mentioned, it was market and performance -- I'm sorry, performance inflows that drove the $175 billion to $200 billion. Is it fair to say you had more than, say, $10 billion to $12 billion of inflows into what you would consider ESG products if we back out the market for the second quarter? Adam Spector : I think we're going to have to get back to you on that. I don't have that number in front of me. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. William Katz : Maybe first question, coming back to expenses for a moment. What is your market assumption as you think through the fourth quarter? And then maybe the broader question is, Matt, you mentioned that there's some synergies coming. I don't know if that's just sort of remaining synergies with the deal, if there's anything new. Any way to sort of at least initially ring-fence how you're thinking about fiscal '22, maybe excluding performance fee contribution on the comp side or the close-end fund vehicle just for comparison perspective? Matthew Nicholls : What was the first question, Bill? The first question. William Katz : So I was just asking about on expenses, just the guidance for the fourth quarter, is that assuming flat markets like it's been historically? Or is it... Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Okay. Yes. It's assuming flat market for the fourth quarter. So -- and performance fees at the rate that I just talked about versus anything that might be elevated. In terms of 2022, it's, obviously, a little bit early at the moment to rather focus on the fourth quarter and then provide you with 2022 views when we talk about the fourth quarter.  But just as a reminder, that on the expense reductions associated with the merger transaction, we've achieved a notional amount of about $150 million, or expect to achieve that amount by year-end. That means that in 2022, we will achieve the other $150 million. So that's sort of a stake in the ground in terms of expense reductions in 2022, all else remaining equal. William Katz : Okay. And then just a follow-up, just to unpack a couple of different things. When I look at the data, you had, I caught that U.S. turned positive this quarter, which would imply that the international book was still outflowing. Maybe you could walk through maybe what's the difference between what's happening non-U.S. versus U.S.? And then just sort of following up on ESG, could you unpack maybe the equity component? I appreciate that you called out a couple of idiosyncratic outflows, but any sort of color on sort of what's coming in the door versus what is exiting? Adam Spector : Sure. So let me try to think about. So from a regional perspective, U.S. is really our largest market. It's somewhere between 70% and 75% of total AUM. And we are net flow positive, both for the quarter and year-to-date. Things are working really well there. We're continuing to do well with our biggest partners. We're cross-selling really well. And then the other thing I think we've done incredibly well in the U.S. is to start to bring more specialists to bear from across our investment teams, alternatives, ETFs, et cetera, to client relationships. So that's been really strong. Americas and our European business are roughly flat, and the outflows really have been in Asia. The Asian outflows are -- you know what's going on in India. That's a significant portion of it. Some of those one-off equity outflows were in Asia as well. That hurt Asia.  And then we've also talked a little bit about some of the issues we've had in Japan. The good news is that we're seeing a turnaround now in Asia. Our Japanese pipeline is really building. It's more diversified and we're adding new clients there. Our Australian retail business is incredibly strong. I think we're something like 15 months in a row in net positive flow in Australian retail. So really starting to see Asia turn around, and that's been the region that's been the slowest for us. In terms of your other question about what do we see in the future. I really think of distribution as having that one part that's really the machine, Bill, that's working. And that's the kind of continual grind, day in and day out to make sales to defend assets. And that's just going well for us really across the board. So the machine is working. We're working really well in terms of the central distribution teams with our SIMs distribution teams. We're executing on our plan. It's the big chunky stuff that just hasn't been breaking our way lately, and that's what's been really impacting some of the negative numbers. We've got a lot, though, in the pipeline, a lot of deals we're working on, and I think those bigger things will start to break for us shortly. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I want to finish up on that thought. I like -- I could see the increased diversification of your flows. I like the anecdote you gave us on 15 of the top 20 net flow funds outside your largest 20. I am curious about the large 20 though also, mainly because they're large. And I noticed gross sales are still down on the quarter-on-quarter, you said seasonality. But how should we think about what to expect on both gross sales and net flows, given that the biggest funds aren't contributing. I want to take away from all the efforts that you talked about on the diversification part there, great. But the big fund is still not. Adam Spector : So two things. One, there really is a seasonal effect. We've gone back for as far as we have data for the combined companies, and this quarter was always the slowest for gross sales. So there is a seasonal effect that's historic.  In terms of the largest funds, right, if you think about things like Western core or DynaTech or the income fund, those are still among our top-selling funds and are in positive flow. So a number of the largest funds still are growing. So we do think that we have the right balance between the absolute largest funds growing, but it's not only the largest funds that are growing. We've got a number of funds that are under, say, $2 billion where we see a lot of momentum. And I think that speaks really lend to the longer-term stability of the business.  And one of the things we're trying to focus on is to really build a stable base for years to come. And I think when you're too focused in one geography and one vehicle type and one investment team, that creates a little instability in the business. So we're glad that a few of those huge funds are still growing are net flow positive, but we want to add diversification to the mix as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : I wanted to start with your outlook for the closed-end fund market. We obviously saw you in the market last quarter with the product. Some of your peers have been fairly active there as well. Is the market environment conducive to do more of those kind of things? And then if so, maybe talk a little bit about the strategies where that would make most sense. Adam Spector : Yes. I think what we've seen is now that there's an ability to kind of structure closed-end funds in a way that's a little different than they were done years ago. There's really significantly more receptivity to the vehicle. I think it works well for investors, for the investment manager as well as for the distributors. So I think we're going to see more of them. Certainly, when you have $1 billion plus raise, you want to do more. We're currently in discussion with a number of distributors for a range of different products. And I think you'll see us come to market again. Alexander Blostein : Great. And then a lot of discussion on the call, obviously, around the diversification of the business and kind of really building out and scaling some things that you guys have built or acquired over the last couple of years. As I think about the capital return profile on a forward basis from an M&A perspective, maybe give us your kind of updated thoughts there as well. How big overall organic opportunity be as part of Franklin? Matthew Nicholls : I think -- go ahead, Jenny. Jennifer Johnson : Well, I was going to say -- let me just start, Matt, and then maybe you can go. Matthew Nicholls : Sure. Jennifer Johnson : So we've kept -- and we've always said this, but we've kept a strong balance sheet because we want to be opportunistic and have the ability. It is -- we believe we have the broadest product lineup in the industry. And so from an acquisition -- to go out and do a large-scale acquisition, we would only be adding assets as opposed to capabilities. And often, there's a strategic buyer that will spend more than we will when you're just adding some assets. So it's probably unlikely, but we never say never if the right opportunity came up, we'd be open to it.  Having said that, we've been, I think, pretty clear on the areas that we're focused on expanding. We want to grow our alternatives business. It is a major priority for us. We view that when we think about kind of growth opportunities, it's growing our alt. While we're $141 billion and I think bigger than most people realize as far as our alt business, it's still less than 10% of our AUM, and we think that there's more opportunity to grow there.  We've already stated that we like the high net worth business. It's Fiduciary Trust, again, is one of the premier players in that space. We, again, celebrating their 90 years, a very fragmented market. and we'd like to do more acquisitions there. And what we're finding is there's more pressure on small RIAs that they want to join bigger firms who has all the capabilities that a fiduciary has with their trust and tax planning, generation education. All those things are now being demanded. And so you'll see us, we said, I think when we were a $20 billion that we would -- we'd see ourself growing to $50 million. We're already at $33 billion, and we continue to look to expand there. And then I would just say that if there are opportunities, we'd like to have more scale in places like ETFs, it's -- we love our ETF franchise. We think we have a phenomenal team -- if something came up in a particular region that could be interesting to us. But today at 50% active, we actually think we've got really good products in that space. And then I would just say that we've talked about in the past on the fintech side, these will be more smaller investments or acquisitions. There'll be things that are specifically designed to help our distribution capabilities, things like our investment in Embark that was designed specifically for greater penetration on distribution. It turned out to be a good investment, too, but those types of things are -- you'll continue to see us focus there. Matt, do you have anything to add? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. And you covered it perfectly. I think just a little bit more on the alt side, I mean, I think, Alex, the way we sort of think about the alternatives business is that's probably about 15% of our adjusted revenue at the moment. And we would like that to be significantly more than that. As you know, it's a large and growing area of asset management, and we have a really small market share overall. We think it's great what we have, and we're very pleased with the growth rate both organically and the ability to bolt things on, such as the REIT transaction. We just have Benefit Street Partners. But there's -- we've got real missing components of the overall alternative asset strategy group that we've sort of formed, which is a grouping of companies in the alternative asset space. And for example, we have nothing in the equity alternative asset arena. So we're very focused on that, and we think we're a very good home and we think we've got the right structure to put in place to make it very attractive for those companies out there.  And another -- Jenny already mentioned wealth and distribution. The other thing I would think about around this is, in a way, in many ways, it's a capital allocation question. And with our income profile now, if you take the very important dividend into account a couple of hundred million dollars of share repurchases to make sure that we at least offset compensation grants, it leaves us with $1 billion to invest approximately in the firm, and that's unlevered and that will be fully invested in the firm in terms of acquisitions, in terms of investing in the business across all the SIMs.  I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, for example, that we've allocated $440 million new seed and co-invest capital since we announced the acquisition, that's already turned into over $4 billion of AUM. So it's almost like a tenfold return in that regard in terms of turning it from an AUM returns perspective. So we see a lot of opportunities there. And We're being very disciplined about how we think about that. The size of our balance sheet gives us more confidence to spend that money each year and frankly, we're very active across these areas strategically. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : I was just hoping to dig in a little bit more on the alternative opportunity set, the alts products within the retail channel. If you could just talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about the opportunity set there? It would seem that there could be opportunities for Clarion, with a private REIT, with Benefit Street, with a private -- I know you have some public entities there. Can you just elaborate on the opportunity set, which products can make the most sense? And how big could this be for Franklin? Adam Spector : Yes. It sounds like you work in our alternatives marketing group because I think you've really hit on 2 of the most important opportunities for us where we're spending significant attention. I think the other thing that we really need to do is to work with our distribution partners to understand what they're looking for. The other thing we've seen some growth in is our hedge fund business in the retail channel. I think that could be really strong. But BSP, Clarion, obviously, two of the biggest offerings. I would also say that in some more of the traditional asset classes like fixed income, there are ways to structure things so that it has more of an alternative feel to it as well as the characteristics that one would expect from alternative investments in a more traditional asset class, and we're seeing that in the retail channel as well. Jennifer Johnson : And Adam, I would just say that you take a Clarion, I mean one of the feedback we're getting from some of our large distribution partners is a concern that they have a low concentration in managers, and they want diversification. And here, you got Clarion at $60-plus billion, and with unbelievable performance coming out of this COVID period, and really has only been institutional distribution. And so we just think there's just tremendous upside there because there's a desire on the distribution side to diversify their managers. And we've got the distribution team to support the alternatives business and really the products there. Adam Spector : And the final thing I would add is that the fundraising in that channel tends to be kind of a multipronged thing. You bring a fund period 1, and then you can come back to market a year later, x number of quarters. And so I do see the real potential to have sequential growth in our raises there as those advisers become more comfortable with the brand and the process of allocating to alternatives. Matthew Nicholls : And then the other sort of additional point is that there are some very attractive alternative asset strategies that we don't yet own because we don't have the capability that we think is very logical connection with a large distribution business like ours. Jennifer Johnson : And we don't talk about it, but I think we showed a little bit -- we have a very strong venture group. And while they're small in the individual private funds, they actually came out of our growth franchise at Franklin because of the ability to put some illiquid assets in mutual funds. And so they're probably -- I don't know, Matt, I think it's about $2 billion in venture investments, albeit a large part of it within our traditional kind of mutual funds. But they're now starting to be selected as a lead against very competitive other VCs on offering. So we're really excited because we think there's a lot of opportunity there. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO, for final comments. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. I just want to thank everybody for their time today. And we appreciate you guys taking the time to the call, and I want to wish everybody through this next phase of the Delta variant and everything to stay healthy through these times. So thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is April, and I will be your call operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. Thank you. You may begin.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're also very excited to announce the acquisition of Lexington Partners, and I am delighted to extend our warmest welcome to such a talented team. Lexington\u2019s business provides us the exposure to a critical growth area in the alternative asset business, and we cannot be happier with this new partnership. We'll cover more in this transaction in a few minutes. Matthew Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are on the call with me today. We're also joined by Tom Gahan, Head of Franklin Templeton Alternatives; and Will Warren, President of Lexington partners, who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. I'll start by reviewing this year's milestones. Then Matt will go through our financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year as well spend some time discussing today's important transaction in greater detail. Throughout Franklin Templeton history, we have invested in our business to build a truly diversified and resilient organization that performs across market cycles with a commitment to serving our clients, employees and shareholders. The results that we announced today represent the first full fiscal year since we closed the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformational transaction that created a more balanced business across asset classes, client mix and geographies. We are pleased to report that the strategic and financial benefits from our acquisition of Legg Mason exceeded our goals, and we have added important growth opportunities. Over the course of the year, we have created a management team consisting of key representation from Franklin Templeton, Legg Mason and our specialists investment managers. We have maintained our culture while invigorating collaboration and innovation across the firm. Through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've successfully brought two firms together to maximize our collective potential, one that successfully combines the attributes of global strength with boutique specialization. We've made strong progress and yet in so many ways we're just getting started. Turning to investment performance. There has been an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies. Through September, 71%, 69%, 72%, and 77% of strategy composites outperform their respective benchmarks across the four key time periods. This quarter, we had 53% of mutual fund AUM in funds with four or five star ratings by Morningstar compared to 43% a year ago. During the year, we focused on updating our global distribution efforts by enhancing our general specialist model, reshaping client coverage and deepening relationships in each sales region, particularly with the largest global financial institutions. Fiscal year long-term inflows doubled to $365 billion from the prior year. Notably, the U.S., which is our largest sales region, with over $1.1 trillion in AUM was net flow positive for the year. In terms of notable organic growth, we saw positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMEs, Wealth Management, and ESG-specific strategies. We executed important acquisitions to further grow and diversify our business and alternative assets, customization, and distribution of investment strategies. In terms of other accomplishments, alternative asset strategies, an important area of focus for us, generated positive net flows in each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the prior year, to $145 billion in AUM, with contributions from a diverse group of strategies, including real estate, infrastructure, private debt, and hedge funds. Several years ago, we announced our intention to create a full suite of alternative strategies and we've been very deliberate in building our capabilities. In 2018, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners brought us a leading alternative credit manager. In 2020, we added a world-class real estate manager with Clarion Partners. This focus on alternatives led us to today's announcement of the acquisition of Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments. We now have top tier specialist investment managers in all of the key alternative categories with Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, Franklin Venture Partners, K2 and now Lexington Partners. Specifically with the Lexington Partners transaction, I'm excited that Franklin Templeton will be partnering with such an outstanding firm that is led by an experienced and talented team immediately bringing a scale and capabilities in an attractive and growing global market. There will be no changes to the team or its independent investment management process and they will continue to operate autonomously as Lexington Partners. Upon the close of this transaction, we expect our alternative AUM to approach approximately $200 billion and over $1 billion in revenue, excluding performance fees. Matt will review the additional details of the transaction shortly. Another core growth area is our separately managed account business. We are a top three provider in SMEs with $125 billion in assets under management, which is one of the fastest growing segments in retail. Our SMA business grew by 23% in AUM year-over-year and generated positive net flows in each quarter during the fiscal year. Our recently announced acquisition of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, and its custom indexing platform, Canvas, will take our existing strengths in SMA to the next level, enhancing our tax management factor-based and ESG customization capabilities. Canvas was launched in late 2019, and has seen strong growth since its inception, and now represents $1.9 billion of the firm's total AUM of $6.3 billion as of September 30. The transaction will bring compelling benefits to the clients that both companies serve across multiple channels. There's no question that investors are more focused on ESG goals than ever before. Increasingly, there are three dimensions to ESG that investors consider : ESG factors as understood risks in a portfolio, how ESG contributes to overall returns, and the overall impact of ESG considerations to society and the environment. As an active manager, approximately 95% of our AUM represents strategies that consider ESG factors as part of the investment process, and ESG-specific strategies, representing over $200 billion in AUM were netflow positive in each quarter this fiscal year. All this being said, none of our accomplishments this past year would be possible if it weren't for our employees. We're extremely fortunate to have such dedicated colleagues who are focused on achieving investment excellence, fostering enduring relationships, and delivering superior service to our broad range of investors around the globe. Now, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results from the fourth quarter and fiscal year, as well as take you through the specifics of the Lexington transaction. Matt? Matthew Nicholls : Thank you, Jenny. Fourth quarter long-term net outflows were $9.9 billion, which were partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill\u2019s high yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds, which added $3.5 billion in AUM enclosed in July. This quarter included the previously disclosed $5.4 billion 529 plan redemption, which included $4.7 billion of long-term assets, a $2 billion fixed income institutional redemption that have minimal impact to revenue and $800 million of fixed income outflows from the non-management fee earning India credit funds that are in the process of liquidation. Reinvested dividends with $2.3 billion this quarter, 1% higher average assets under management of $1.55 trillion, compared to the prior quarter, plus $69 million of performance fees generated $1.66 billion in adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter. Investment management fees excluding performance fees were 3% higher compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the quarter were 3% lower due to lower compensation and lower G&A as a result of last quarters, up front closed end fund expenses. This led to an 8% increase in adjusted operating income and $647 million and an adjusted operating margin of 39%. Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $645 million, or $1.26 per share. These results include favorable discrete tax items of $135 million, or $0.30 per share for the quarter. Turning to 2021 fiscal year financial results, which benefited from favorable market conditions and a full year of Legg Mason versus two months last year. For the full year, adjusted revenues were $6.32 billion and adjusted operating expenses were $3.94 billion, an increase of 63% and 65% respectively. This led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.38 billion, which was 60% higher compared to the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin was 37.7%. Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income increased 46% to $1.92 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $3.74 per share, which included the impact of favorable discrete tax items of $175 million or $0.34 per share for the full year. As planned, we have achieved a run rate of 85% of our targeted merger related cost synergies of $300 million this year. We anticipate that 100% of these synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2022. As a reminder, none of these cost efficiencies involved our specialist investment managers, or investment teams. Moving on to Capital Management, we believe our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. For the fiscal year ended September 30, we returned $782 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the year, we also pre financed a large portion of legacy Legg Mason debt with lower cost of debt reflecting our credit profile. Specifically, we issued $850 million of 1.6% Senior Notes due 2030 and $350 million 2.95% Notes due 2051. We redeemed $250 million of 6.3% Legg Mason Jr. subordinated notes due 2056. On March 15, 2021, and 500 million of 5.45% Legg Mason Jr. subordinated notes due 2056 on September 15, 2021. We ended the quarter with $6.93 billion of cash and investments. We will continue to prioritize our dividend and intend to repurchase enough shares to at least offset our employee equity drops. The remainder of our capacity will focus on continued investments in our business and acquisitions to further diversify and increase our sources of cash flow, while positioning our firm the new growth opportunities as the industry continues to evolve. Consistent with this, we're excited to share the specifics on the acquisition of Lexington Partners that we announced this morning. As outlined in the transaction summary document, Lexington Partners is a global leader in secondary private equity and co-investments with current fee based AUM of $34 billion. Since its founding in 1934, Lexington has raised over $55 billion in aggregate capital commitments, and currently has a team of 135 employees across 8 global offices. It is expected to generate revenue of approximately $350 million and EBITDA of approximately $150 million in 2022. With this acquisition, we now have strong and complementary capabilities in alternative credit, real estate, hedge fund solutions, and PE related activities. Given the overall size and growth of private equity and the likelihood of further private markets expansion, having a specialist investment manager tied to this sector alternative assets is a logical step in a diversification of our business. Furthermore, providing access diversified versions of higher returning investments will continue to increase in importance to meet savings and retirement goals of our broad group of clients. This could also be important in both our multi asset solutions business and the continued development of our customization capabilities. As Jenny mentioned earlier, this transaction takes us one important step further in creating a larger and more diversified alternative asset business and will result in performance fiscal year 2022 alternative asset AUM for approximately $200 billion, producing approximately $1 billion in annual management fee revenue, excluding performance fees, at a margin of approximately 40%. We intend to continue adding complimentary business in both wealth management and asset management, including asset class and geographic expansion. This will be both organic investments through allocating capital into our existing specialist investment managers and via acquisitions. Given our global reach, financial flexibility, business model and experience and execution, we're able to attract highly talented teams and partnerships, looking for a combination of independence, support and collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities in what is a very large and expanding segment of the asset management industry. Turning to financial terms of the transaction, we're acquiring 100% Lexington Partners for $1 billion in cash at closing, plus a further $750 million in cash over the next three years. We have also structured this transaction to ensure continuity and strong alignment of interest with Lexington\u2019s clients, partners and employees over the long term. Consistent with this, we will be simultaneously issuing grants equal to 25% of Lexington to employees of Lexington subject to five-year vesting and establishing a performance based cash retention for the $338 million to be paid over the next five years. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our fiscal second quarter subject to customary approvals. And now, we would like to open the call up to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. So I like that you\u2019re using the cash to buy into good businesses. I think everything is accretive when you're earning nothing on cash. So I'm a big fan of that. If I took all the purchase price pieces and we can't see it all, it looks to me in the range of high teens to 22 times EBITDA. I'm just curious if that's about right, and what kind of ROI that that kind of comes out to? Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Assume whether you take the $1.75 billion or whether you take the $1.75 billion plus the $338 million of additional deferred compensation. Glenn Schorr : And maybe the 25% of the company also, right? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So, yes, of course. Yes. Well, yes, I mean all the multiples we just referred to assume 75% of the EBITDA numbers that we just announced. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Matthew Nicholls : So pretty simple. I mean, just take 150 times 75% divided by the amount we\u2019re paying. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Okay. And I'm curious on - you are piecing as you went through, you\u2019re piecing together a bunch of interesting pieces of the alternative pie. So between beneficiary Lexington and Clarion, K2, what\u2019s the thought process on how you do or do not integrate? I noticed that you\u2019re forming and funding specialist distribution team. But the historical Legg Mason never really integrated their boutique, so curious on how you're approaching the integration of all your alternative pieces. Thank you. Jennifer Johnson : So I\u2019ll start and then have Tommy add to it. So, obviously, that one of the differences when you acquire alternative managers is there\u2019s a lot of things that traditional asset managers can be shared across investment teams that isn't the case. For example, an alternatives manager may want their own legal expertise, since they're doing deals and things. And so there's a lot more that sits within the independent specialized investment team in the alternatives world. And in one of the changes that we've made with the acquisition of Legg Mason is having more institutional salespeople within the investment groups. So that's already part of an alternatives manager. And what we are working hard to build, as we believe the opportunity to democratize alternative assets in the more retail channel, is that global distribution of alternatives. I don\u2019t know, Tommy, you want to add anything to that? Tom Deane : No, I mean, I think that\u2019s - hey, Glenn, how are you? I think that's exactly it. I mean, I think we see opportunities in alternatives broadly defined, expect that to continue to grow at a really strong rate. And it\u2019s really sort of bringing the power of the platform to bear on the distribution alternatives, both institutional and retail. And the joint venture that we\u2019ve effectively created as is first focusing on retail, and then we\u2019ll look to expand it. But given the $200 billion now in AUM, we can afford to invest more in these types of products and services, which I think is - I think it's going to be good for everybody. Jennifer Johnson : And Glenn, just one other point. As we tried to fill out our products breadth, we really believe the opportunity of multi asset solutions, that's where it gets knitted together as well. And that's kind of a - requires the teams to be communicating. You're going to look at risk factors across as you're building additional products around that. Glenn Schorr : Thank you, both. Appreciate it. Matthew Nicholls : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just building a little bit more on Lexington and kind of what that business looks like. I guess first, pretty impressive growth in their funds over the last couple of vintages. Maybe give us a sense what you are assuming in terms of growth for Lexington into 2022 and 2023 and what the earn outs are going to be based on? Jennifer Johnson : We\u2019ll let Will take that answer. Wilson Warren : Thanks. Yes, we've been able to raise significant capital in our areas of focus in secondaries, both our flagship funds or our middle market funds, and then our co-investment business. So there's some structural drivers in each of those businesses that we think expand the market opportunities we look forward. So we're excited to go after it with our new partners and that's really it. Tom Deane : Yes. And I think, Alex, in terms of the - what needs to be achieved to get to the hurdles on the various contingent consideration, we cannot talk about future fundraising on this call. But if you look at the past history of the company and the timing around some of these things we do - we do have some growth built in, but I wouldn't say particularly aggressive growth for the future, given a potential that we think we had together. One of the very attractive things about Lexington Partners is, frankly, they're very successful on their own. So the forward-looking growth of Lexington standalone is very attractive to us. And then when you apply the additional growth potential through adding our resources and broader client base across high net worth and other distribution globally, we think it could actually add more to the numbers that we've highlighted today. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks. And my follow-up just around the balance sheet dynamics performer for the deal. The deck says you guys have about $6 billion of cash and investments on a pro forma basis after the deal. Can you give us a sense how much of the six is ultimately kind of unrestricted cash? So if you wanted to do something when they are paid out tomorrow, what would that look like? And then how much of future funds do you expect Ben's balance sheet to participate in? So in other words, like the co-investment or seed capital, whatnot, is it going to be 100% based on Franklin's balance sheet? And how much of sort of resources do you think that's going to take on future fundraisers? Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Okay. Thanks, Alex. So a couple of things there. In terms of the sort of unrestricted cash that\u2019s available to do other things at the time that we close this transaction and we're assuming that we can close this transaction at the end of March, that that number will probably be something like $1 billion. So that's question one.  Question two on the GP commitment. There is very strong demand for the GP commitment from partners and employees, both at Lexington. And I know that the Franklin Templeton senior executives and other folks are looking forward to being part of that also. But you're right to highlight the fact that Franklin Templeton will also, from a balance sheet perspective, be committing capital to support the GP level. So yes, we have a commitment to that. We obviously can't say what the amount is, because it depends on future fundraising. Alexander Blostein : Great, thank you very much for the questions. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the deal announcement. Matt, just question for you just around the carry economics. I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate on that. I didn't. I don't think I heard that. Apologies. I missed it. And then just on the equity that's granted to employees in Lexington. Just curious the thought process around why not grant equity in shares of the parent in Franklin Templeton? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So what was the first question again? Michael Cyprys : It carried. Matthew Nicholls : So yes, so carry, we're going to share in something like 20% of carry going forward. The focus for us, and then we haven't acquired any past carry either from previous funds. The focus on us in this transaction was the very attractive management fee stream at a much higher fee rate than our average rate and the growth potential of that. We think, and I think investors believe, and certainly collection partners, the alignment of interest through allocating the majority of carry to the producers in the company is very important. So that's what we focused on in terms of structuring the transaction. What was the second question? Michael Cyprys : The second part was just around the the equity ownership? Why not engineers? Matthew Nicholls : Good, good question. So firstly, it may not surprise you to hear us say that we believe that ventures are quite undervalued. So we don\u2019t really like to tie loot our shares. We don\u2019t need to but, the more important parts of the question is that we think that the alignment of interests through providing equity in the actual business that the folks are operating in, you can\u2019t get a whole lot better than that. We\u2019ve got plenty of incentives across the firm, to make sure people collaborate and coordinate to create more value. The more that that happens, and that we create more revenue and EBITDA, the more Lexington will be worth in this case and the more Franklin will be worth. So we think that the two things aligned very well, in this in this regard, and frankly is probably better shareholder value for Franklin investors. Michael Cyprys : Got it? And a follow up question if I could, just more a bigger picture. I think there was reference in the deck about opportunities to extend the Lexington business into private credit and into real estate. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the opportunity set there, how that might be accomplished, what sort of hurdles there might be with putting through that sort of extension and growth. And just more broadly on the retail opportunity set to do talk a little bit about that, because clearly, Franklin has strong retail distribution. Jennifer Johnson : Tommy why don\u2019t you take that that question. Well, you\u2026? Tom Deane : Well, I think that we have tremendous growth opportunities in each of each of the verticals. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand products, organically as well as inorganically. With respect to potential fundraising activity targeted at secondary real estate, or private credit, I'd sort of push that back to Will. Wilson Warren : Yes so, as I said earlier, we see structural growth in our core products that exist today, but they are also secondary markets developing in in the areas you mentioned in private credit, and certainly in real estate. So as the alternatives universe grows, one of the interesting things about this transaction is the ability to consider raising dedicated capital in those areas. So that will be something that we\u2019ll look at over the medium term, I\u2019d say. Michael Cyprys : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So Franklin operates increasingly as a multi brand and arguably the multi boutique asset manager model. And you highlighted your intent to continue to acquire more, I guess, other publicly traded multi brand asset manager models commanded discount. So some questions on this. So how does Franklin not get perpetually trapped into trading at a conglomerate or multi brand discount, particularly as you acquire more brands? And then to Glenn's question, in your response about solutions being the point of differentiation, and knitting together the various products? Can you flesh out more how you are thinking about solution based products and services on the alt side? It looks like for example, the bigger alternatives are buying insurance companies to leverage their diverse product offerings and creative solutions break base offerings set, so more more color, if you could on the solutions roadmap. Jennifer Johnson : Yes, so first of all, we\u2019d look at it and say that, frankly large asset managers with the broad capability that we have, we think should be selling at a premium, not a discount. Because the sum of the parts, if the sum of the parts isn\u2019t greater than the discrete parts, then we failed. So why is that? You look at starting with just our large partners clients, they are consolidating the number of firms they do business with, and you have to have a broad breadth of capability to be able to make those lists. Number two, if you think about just what\u2019s happening today, with technology and technology disruption, and I\u2019ll just start out with we talked about, as an active manager, if you\u2019re not really good at leveraging data science and data analytics, ultimately, you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing and active management and data is expensive. Our approach is at the center, we\u2019ve created for example, an investment data lake and our individual teams of data scientists in there. So they can leverage that at their at their opt in choice. But we can negotiate large vendor contracts and gain independent access to unique cross-sells versus a data. Those types of advantages, if executed well at the core, become a massive opportunity. And then there are things back to that kind of partner point when you have a broad depth breadth of assets. You can do things like we have the Franklin Templeton Academy, which we built for emerging markets and find that partners in the developed markets want access to that kind of capability to do training of their teams. Thought Leadership with the institution, or the institute the Franklin Templeton Institute. It\u2019s something that\u2019s sought after by our large partners and then of course, just a massive global distribution footprint that no individual manager could ever support that kind of capability. And so, we think that that brings a strong premium. On your point on on solutions, Yes. I mean, you see what's happening in the insurance business, it's, it probably, that model will continue, you'll see more of those kind of deals, although there's a limited number. Yes, if you have a good solutions team that can bring together and customize. That\u2019s an opportunity, and we look at where we can continue to grow that. But we also see it as an opportunity with our existing partners. And I know Matt's dying to add something here. Matthew Nicholls : I would just say kind of the highest level we don\u2019t really see ourselves, the multi affiliate asset management company from a model perspective. I wouldn\u2019t confuse the autonomy and independence of our teams with being a multi affiliate asset management company. The brand strategy is because a number of our specialist investment managers are known very well for exactly what they do. And we don\u2019t want to dilute that in any way. And that seems to resonate in the marketplace, both institutional and through other big distribution channels. That\u2019s number one. And number two, while the coordination and collaboration across the firm, is some of the things that Jenny mentioned, do not in any way dilute the independence and autonomy of our specialized investment management companies. It is it is really good. There\u2019s collaboration across the firm. And we\u2019re definitely seeing increased opportunities via that collaboration. And it\u2019s opt-in collaboration, we don\u2019t force it across the firm. And you\u2019re seeing an in an increasingly competitive environment, across the industry, that it\u2019s, it\u2019s really energizing for the company and our specialist, investment managers. We -- one thing we will have in common is we all want to grow, we want to compete, and we want to win. And we\u2019re finding that this is a good strategy for us at least. It doesn\u2019t mean that other models don\u2019t work really well. Also, we have tremendous respect for our colleagues that have slightly different versions of our model. In our opinion, we think of ourselves almost like as a hybrid of a model that the we\u2019ve referred to. And in terms of the insurance piece, we study these things pretty carefully. We have a pretty meaningful insurance, angle ourselves. But it\u2019s an area that that we\u2019re very interested in also. So, it\u2019s one thing at a time, obviously, as we continue to build new opportunities for the company. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts as we think about expenses for next year. But maybe, Matt, if you could give us a framework to think about fiscal 2022 in terms of either x, the transactions, maybe on a core basis, or we can think about expense growth, or if you want to talk about them together, that would be helpful. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, there. Sure. So including, including Lexington, assuming that we close March 31, or around that date, April 1 say, I would just take the numbers we provided in the margin we provided just divided by two, what sorry, the margin won\u2019t be divided in two, the revenue and EBITDA would be divided by two, just assume that to add it in. So putting that aside, it on a standalone basis. For the first quarter, first quarter we were very early to give guidance for the year. But for the first quarter, excluding performance fees, we would expect our revenue to be approximately flat for the quarter and expenses to be down in the low single digits, let\u2019s say because as you know, we do have some run rate expenses rolling through from last year from the merger related synergies. So we\u2019ve got that we\u2019ve got that happening. So I think, I would say that all else remain equal. Markets remain stable. We expect our adjusted operating revenue to remain at current levels and adjusted operating expenses to be down low, single digits compared to the fourth quarter. This is all excluding performance fees. As you know, we have had elevated performance fees for the last two quarters with $102 million in third quarter and $69 in the fourth quarter. Now obviously that does vary. I would in terms of modeling on that one. I think there\u2019s been a little bit of confusion around how to think of that. I would just think of half of that being and the other half being not the other half coming to the parent. If that\u2019s helpful. Daniel Fannon : That is just to clarify that. When you say that\u2019s percentage down for expenses quarter-over-quarter or... Matthew Nicholls : Yes, yes. Yes. So sorry, low single digit percentages. Daniel Fannon : Great. And then just in terms of the core business and gross sales and momentum in the prepared remarks, you talked about onboarding a wide range of product offerings with your largest global financial partners. So can you maybe expand upon I think you talked about Edward Jones last quarter, but maybe some other tangible examples of what products or channels are seeing that. And then also, maybe if they\u2019re, you\u2019ve had some one-off redemptions that you\u2019ve called out before, if there\u2019s anything to note for the fourth quarter, I\u2019m sorry, your fiscal first quarter that we should be aware of as well. Jennifer Johnson : Adam, you want to take that? Adam Spector : Sure. So let\u2019s talk about the on-boarding. And I\u2019ll go back to what we said about the merger, over a year ago, and how complimentary the two firms were. And if you think about the U.S., Legacy, Franklin, so much stronger, in the regional an independent channel legs stronger, and the wires outside of the U.S. Franklin much stronger in retail banking markets like Germany, Italy, with Legg Mason having a better presence in private banking. Each of those business segments really operate separate platforms. So Legg had its product on one set of platforms, Franklin on the other. Often, it takes a little bit of effort and work and sometimes formal agreements, to be able to participate on those platforms. Since we had the platforms, we were able over this year to execute a strategy where we brought on negative Franklin product on the Legg Mason platforms, and vice versa. That means that we have far more funds in the U.S. and the outside of U.S. now available for sale. That process took several quarters to execute. And we\u2019re now in a position where we think we can sell significantly more next year because we\u2019re able to do that. Daniel Fannon : And I guess, Adam, in terms of the lumpy lumpiness, if you will, of numbers going into the fourth quarter, we there are a couple of potential large increases. Because one of the things we haven\u2019t talked about since the announcement publicly is the O'Shaughnessy Asset Management acquisition, which was a very important acquisition in terms of customization capabilities. And that\u2019s a tremendous team. And we\u2019re really excited about what that could bring for us that may close in our first quarter. And that will add almost $7 billion under management. And then we also announced publicly, obviously, the acquisition of a team, a new team within fixed income in the LDI space that is expected to race fairly quickly. Again, it could be first quarter second quarter, but that that could be a few billion dollars. We will call out specifically that time. Jennifer Johnson : And just to kind of put an exclamation mark on it. I mean, I think the past there are times where we were very concentrated on a few products. Today, our top 10 funds represent only 19% of our AUM and of 14 out of the top 20 funds, by flows are not our largest funds. We are really not only diversifying our client base, but also very much diversifying our, our product base. And in the case of something like Oh, Sam, we\u2019re excited about direct indexing. But we\u2019re also excited about the capabilities of that being referred to deliver just our core active strategies as well, down the road, really enhancing the SMA portion of that. Adam Spector : And Jenny, I would say that the diversification is equally true on the institutional side, where we look at our pipeline, there were no strategy, I think, is our first kind of asset classes more than 17% of our pipeline at this point. So really diversified on the institutional side as well. Daniel Fannon : Thank you. Adam Spector : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple follow up on the $130 million of EBITDA. So Matthew, you said to just divide it by two for the six months, so I\u2019m guessing that that means there\u2019s no carry in that 160. Matthew Nicholls : Correct. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Great. And then does that mean that the 25% interest will sort of move with the vesting schedule, so five percentage points of interest going to that team per annum. Matthew Nicholls : No that that will be immediate. So that will run through, we\u2019re, going through the \u2013 we\u2019re obviously going to work through the best way to account for the transaction in the process of doing that. But I would look at it on a on a sort of an adjusted basis, you can expect to see 75 of the impact will be 75% of those numbers that we\u2019ve highlighted running throughout our running through our P&L, basically. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Matthew Nicholls : And then I would just apply, our average tax rate to the EBITDA to get to a rough contribution level in terms of net income, we expect it to be probably mid to a little bit better single digits, accretion immediately on an annualized basis. Brennan Hawken : Got it. And then when we think about this, we I know there\u2019s the 338 of performance, bad performance metrics tied to them. But are there any other performance or retention components to the 25%? In other words, is that transferable? Are there any performance pieces connected? What else is linked in with Franklin over the long term? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s a really important question, something that obviously, well was very focused on as well as us from the team. And we -- that that, that 25%, that over a five year period, and there are non-solicitation, non-compete all the things that you would expect around how you retain, incentivize senior employees that are equity holders in the company. So we have all those things. That\u2019s it, it vests ratably, over the five years, and at the end of that five year period, there are basically options around who can acquire the equity. Franklin obviously, is one that could acquire, but there\u2019s a lot, there\u2019s going to be a lot of demand for that equity internally at Lexington, including through their own bonus pool. So that\u2019s something that, well, maybe what\u2019s the COVID on also in terms of the dialogue that we had and then I\u2019ll go back to the contingent piece in a minute. Will? Wilson Warren : Yes, thanks, Matt. I mean, the opportunity to own a significant portion of our own business is something that we understand. The business has grown considerably since it was formed in 1994. And the opportunity, through this partnership and structure with Franklin to broaden that ownership is really exciting for our employees. So, I think this is a this is, for us the chance to have a really powerful and exceptional new partner, and at the same time, really bet on ourselves and our ability to continue to perform for our LPs. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you, Will. And then in terms of the performance base cash awards, Brennan, you talked, you asked about, they don\u2019t begin until the second year, end of the second year, and they run all the way through to the fifth year. And they\u2019re tied to a number of revenue and AUM base metrics that we anticipate over that period of over that period of time. And then there\u2019s time based payments on this also, that, that we were very pleased to work on with the team. So we have a billion dollars at closing and we reference 750 million over three years. And that\u2019s $750 million is split $250 million in the first year $400 million, the end of the second year and $100 million at the end of the third year. And then the $338 and then the $338 is pretty much even. It's a little bit different numbers but very evenly split between the second year right the way through to the fifth through to the fifth year. So it\u2019s quite well balanced between through throughout through five years. Brennan Hawken : Thank you for all the details. That\u2019s pretty helpful. Just one clarifying thoughts [Technical difficulty] Jennifer Johnson : Yes, we can't hear you. Try it again. That\u2019s better. Brennan Hawken : Better now. Yes, walk a little bit. The 25% after five years, does that have a chance to actually increase and then election employees participate in more therefore diluting Franklin, is that what you said? I just want to make sure I understood that. Matthew Nicholls : No, no, I meant within the 25%. So within the 25%, it will either circulate within Lexington, it will never go outside of Lexington, other than to Franklin, so it'll either be within Lexington, or Franklin will acquire more. Brennan Hawken : Thank you for clarifying that. Matthew Nicholls : But we expect it to stay within Lexington for the extended period. Brennan Hawken : Understood. Matthew Nicholls : And then I guess just to complete the complete the picture, even if, in theory, even if Lexington Partners decide to sell some of their equity to Franklin, there is a minimum amount of equity that that needs to be held by the Partners when they're actively employed at the company. And it takes a number of years to sell down the equity. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident at the circulation point. Brennan Hawken : Thank you for the thoroughness of the answer. Appreciate that. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, and maybe sticking with some of the pay-out or earn outs? Is, is the one make sure you understand this is the 750 that you start paying I guess in year ones through three, is that subject to like an earn out or performance? Or is that just kind of delayed payments and not really, I\u2019ll call it performance faced. Matthew Nicholls : They\u2019re just time based payments. Robert Lee : So, okay, this is time based. Okay, great. And then just stepping back a second, maybe philosophically, the Lexington, you mean, certainly there\u2019s huge value in having them own a piece of their business over time. Clarion, I believe employees, partners, they\u2019re, still own a piece of their business. And I know, something that Legacy Legg struggled with was how to get more, maybe move away, someone from a revenue share more towards having employees and Western and other affiliates own equity meaning is this kind of create any internal pressure or whatnot, whether it\u2019s Benefit Street or the other specialist sales, to kind of revamp, reshape, their structure, and how much how they have equity versus revenue share? Jennifer Johnson : Well, so first of all, the, the nature of which individual investment team structure is often is related to some historical acquisition. And the beauty of the alternatives business is because there\u2019s the carry in there often itself is a great retention tool. And so that\u2019s built into all of our alternatives, businesses. And then, when we did the acquisition, I mean, there were things that we were able to do in the acquisition, like Mason to ensure that incentives are aligned with a parent company, that everybody\u2019s rowing the boat in the same direction. And as we talked about earlier, we\u2019ve created an opt-in environment where we think there are some really good upsides to the teams by leveraging the core part of the business. And what we\u2019ve seen is a real desire. We had recently a CIO forum where the heads of all of our different investment teams got together and I got to tell you, the engagement was outstanding. Everybody really appreciated it. And the conversations were very, very good. And so I think people recognize the benefit of being part of a great organization. Matthew Nicholls : But also Rob just to add to Jenny\u2019s point. If you think about alternative asset, specialist investment managers, they all either have like Clarins, for example, owns 80% Clarins, that\u2019s the same sort of partnership structures we have with Lexington, and Benefit Street Partners we have basically the accretive growth units. It\u2019s not equity, but it\u2019s very close to equity. So in each and in many other businesses, we have the same thing where you\u2019re basically as Jenny mentioned, we\u2019re aligning interests. It doesn\u2019t always have to be with equity, it can be a combination of equity, and cash in terms of how it relates to certain specific growth objectives for that particular business growth targets for that business. So it\u2019s really a combination of things that works well for that specific teams, what we work on with them and what works for the parent company to make sure we get the right growth, growth going. Robert Lee : Great. And maybe if I could squeeze in one quick follow up. I mean that\u2019s the 30 odd billion of fee paying AUM and fundraising was very good, I guess last cycle. But is there a certain amount of dry powder that\u2019s not yet earning fees. Maybe some of those funds are drawdown structures. So, they\u2019re kind of as we look forward is some kind of built in Seagrove, already just from what they\u2019ve already have committed. Jennifer Johnson : So Will, why don\u2019t we why don\u2019t we have you take that? Wilson Warren : Happy to take it. The answer is no. On on existing products, these are commitment fee pain products. Robert Lee : Great, thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Wilson Warren : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank Brian Bedell : Great, thanks good morning, thanks for taking my questions. But most of them and asked and asked and answered just a couple of clarifications on the deal first, and then a longer term question. The AUM, the $200 billion pro forma includes the 55 from Lexington, but on the $1 billion of fees on that, should we be thinking of it on the fee paying AUM contribution, so more like $180 billion, then just to clarify on the $338 million I think, Matt, you said that starts in the second year. So that would not impact fiscal year 2022 whatsoever. And then what is the adjusted tax rates going forward that you're using? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, so a couple things. Firstly, the -- could you just repeat your first question? I didn't fully follow what you said. Brian Bedell : Yes. The $200 billion AUM is $145. Right? Matthew Nicholls : Oh, yes. Yes. Okay. So firstly, that actually, that actually doesn\u2019t include $55 billion. $55 billion is the amount that\u2019s been raised in terms of capital. Since inception, Lexington, it only includes the $34 billion with an assumption of some modest growth. But we\u2019ve been growing, 20% organically across other alternative asset systems. So it includes some growth in those also. So it doesn\u2019t add just the $55 billion, it adds the $34 billion and then the assumption of growth, that\u2019s how you get to the 200, the $200 billion. We feel good about that. What was the second question? Brian Bedell : And that $200 billion at the end of March, basically. Matthew Nicholls : Right. Yes. Brian Bedell : Just a couple on the on the second part of the question is the $338 million I think that starts after fiscal year 2022. And the go-forward tax rate that you're using. Matthew Nicholls : So the first contingent payment that starts in 2020, four actually\u2026 Brian Bedell : Okay, yes. Matthew Nicholls : So that\u2019s that. And then in the other question, you asked. Sorry, I had to, so many questions you asked, well, I\u2019ll get to the taxing second, you asked about the billion dollars of management fees. And yes, that\u2019s that\u2019s, that\u2019s tied to the to 200. And frankly, is quite conservative, probably, that\u2019s only management fee, revenue. It\u2019s not anything to carry, or performance fees or anything like that. We think that\u2019s fairly conservative, because already a fraction standalone, we\u2019re probably at something like $700 million of management fees for the 2021, for example, and then plus, got it got us already quite close to a billion at that 40% margin that I said, I mentioned to you. In terms of the tax rate, I would continue to use the 23% to 24% effective tax rate guidance on all of this. Now we realized that this quarter was unusual in terms of the reserve that we\u2019re able to release. So we do not expect any additional large reserves like that to happen. Although I should point out on taxes, that we\u2019ve probably been able to benefit from about $150 million of the approximately $600 million of tax benefits obtained through the acquisition of Legg Mason. And we should be able to benefit from about another $200 in favorable tax attributes over the next two years. And then and then the rest will be over, probably seven years at that point six or seven years. Brian Bedell : And that\u2019s the cash tax rate as opposed to the 24. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, that\u2019s right. Yes. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great. Thank you for that and maybe just one on ESG. Jenny, you mentioned obviously now you\u2019re up to about $200 billion. Maybe just classifying that between what you would consider, like pure sustainable investments versus exclusionary products. I think before you said, you\u2019ve sort of modeled it after articles eight and nine in terms of classification. So just want to verify that $200 billion is linked to Article 8 and 9 of Europe. And maybe just what your view is that maybe potentially reclassifying U.K. and changing perspectives is, if you will to, in terms of the strategies even raising that $200 billion? Jennifer Johnson : Well. I, so yes, it\u2019s Article 8, 9. So that\u2019s the first part. And if you look at the flows in Europe, I mean, we saw something that says there\u2019s, there\u2019s $2.2 trillion in AUM in 2020, and that\u2019s going to get up to $53 trillion by 2025. I mean, there\u2019s some Article 6 selling, but I got to tell you, the demand is Article 8, 9. So that\u2019s where the growth is. We\u2019ve got very good products there. I think we were very disciplined. Nobody\u2019s claiming greenwashing on our part, we were very disciplined and have a rigorous compliance group reviewing any products before we declare them that way. We have more in the queue that are being reviewed internally. And, we think that what\u2019s happening in Europe is going to happen in Asia and the U.S. as well. Adam, you want to add to that? Adam Spector : I was just going to add to that. If you look at our pipeline, it\u2019s pretty incredible. About 20% of our flows are coming from eight and nine products in Europe. And it\u2019s about 40% of our pipeline. So while we\u2019ve got a decent business there, it\u2019s just growing and growing more quickly than anything else we did. Brian Bedell : That that is super helpful. Thank you for that. It just if you\u2019re able to break it apart between sustainable and exclusionary, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible. Jennifer Johnson : I don\u2019t have them at my fingertips. Adam, I don't know if you do. Adam Spector : I can tell you that. Why don\u2019t we get back to those exact numbers? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. Brian Bedell : Okay. Yes. All right. Thank you so much. Super helpful. Adam Spector : Thank you, Brian. Jennifer Johnson : Great, well, I just want to say thank you for participating in today\u2019s call today. We are at time, as you can hopefully tell, we\u2019ve made a lot of exciting progress over the past 12 months. And yet, in so many ways, we\u2019re just getting started. So once again, we\u2019d like to thank our employees for their hard work and remaining focused on our clients and each other. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. So thanks, everybody, and stay healthy. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts or forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin\u2019s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton\u2019s results for our first fiscal quarter. Matthew Nicholls, our CFO and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are on the call with me today. 2022 marks Franklin Templeton\u2019s 75th anniversary of the company, a proud milestone to be sure. And although much has changed in that time span, our commitment to progress for the benefits of our shareholders, clients and employees has not. After enjoying a strong run since the pandemic lows, global equity markets in 2022 have had a volatile start to the year. Navigating this environment reminds us of the value of active management and the importance of a resilient organization. Throughout our history, we have worked to build a diversified business across asset classes, client types, regions and investment vehicles. In recent years, we further diversified our firm to be well-positioned to offer our clients a full range of investment solutions. Over the course of the past quarter, we have continued to make acquisitions and add resources in key areas driving industry growth such as alternatives, SMAs and wealth management as well as ESG and sustainable investing. As we look to the future, our strong balance sheet provides us with financial flexibility and positions us well across market cycles. Importantly, despite current market conditions, we have the resources to remain focused on executing on our long-term strategic priorities. Turning now to our first fiscal quarter results, long-term net flows of $24.1 billion were the third highest in company history and marked the first positive quarter since December 2014. This compares to long-term net outflows of $9.9 billion in the prior quarter and $4.5 billion of outflows in the prior year quarter. All asset classes saw improved long-term net inflows for the quarter and alternatives posted a tenth consecutive quarter of net long-term inflows with $3 billion. Reinvested distributions, which are typically higher in the first quarter, were elevated at $23.5 billion compared to $12.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021. However, including or excluding reinvested dividends and the newly won mandates from a new investment team, we have made progress in all asset classes. We remain focused on evolving our global distribution efforts and the improvements we have made are driving growth. We have prioritized our focus on our largest markets and clients, which has led to positive long-term net flows in the U.S. and our EMEA region. We are deepening relationships and are positioned for continued sales momentum as we focus on cross-selling across all regions. Investment performance was strong across all periods, with 61%, 70%, 71% and 77% of our strategy composites outperforming their respective benchmarks on a 1, 3, 5 and 10-year basis. For the quarter, 54% of our mutual fund AUM were in funds rated 4 or 5-star by Morningstar compared to 41% a year ago. Assets under management increased 3% during the quarter to $1.58 trillion and that\u2019s an increase of 5% compared to the same quarter a year ago or 8% based upon average AUM. The financial results from our business continued to improve. Adjusted operating income increased by 6% to $686 million quarter-over-quarter and was 25% higher than last year at this time. As mentioned earlier, we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on a number of important trends influencing our industry. Let\u2019s start with alternative asset management. Alternatives represent an increasing share of the asset management industry and a key strategic priority for Franklin Templeton. For the most recent quarter, our alternative assets under management grew 6% from the prior quarter to $154.3 billion and by 21% from the prior year period. With our announcement to acquire Lexington Partners, we now have leading specialist investment managers in key alternative asset categories. When the transaction closes, our pro forma alternative assets under management are expected to be approximately $200 billion. To further develop our alternative asset efforts, this quarter, we also made strategic investments in North Capital, an early stage private securities market platform and Case [ph], a market leader in providing retail investors and their advisors access to alternative investments. Another important area is SMAs, given their higher relative growth rates versus other retail products. Our SMA business grew 8% from the prior quarter to a record $135.7 billion in AUM and by 20% from the prior year quarter. As part of our strategic initiative to bring sophisticated customization to a larger segment of investors, our acquisition of the O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, which closed on December 31, enhances our ability to deliver individualized SMA solutions as we continue to advance the broader evolution of managed accounts. Canvas, our custom indexing solution has doubled its assets in the past year to over $2 billion. Additionally, the number of partner firms, have increased threefold since the announcement. Investors are more focused on ESG and sustainable investing than ever and we aim to provide a range of investment solutions to meet their highly personalized goals and objectives. We are committed to investing in the expertise, resources and tools to develop our leadership position in this critical area. In this context, we are excited to recently announce Anne Simpson as our Global Head of Sustainability, a newly created role charged with driving Franklin Templeton\u2019s overall strategic direction of stewardship, sustainability and ESG investment strategy globally. Anne brings an extensive background with experience in public pension plans at [indiscernible] and the international regulatory and policy arena. We have made important strides in this area in recent years and Anne\u2019s expertise and leadership will help take our firm-wide efforts to the next level. Another strategic development that occurred during the quarter was our agreement with FIS to assume operation of our global transfer agent for a phased transition over the coming year. The combination of meeting technology built by both companies will form a unique global TA offering that will deliver an enhanced service experience. Importantly, the move to a single transfer agent platform will allow fund shareholders and financial professionals the ability to purchase and exchange all of our funds with greater ease. This change is a natural evolution of our business and follows our successful efforts to strategically partner with industry leading firms for functions, including fund administration and application technology. Stepping back and reflecting our overall efforts in the past several years as we brought together world class specialist investment managers, Franklin Templeton is a different business today. We have made significant progress. And yet, as I have said on the previous calls in so many ways, we are just getting started. That\u2019s why in January, we announced the launch of our global advertising campaign, Hello Progress, which reintroduced the Franklin Templeton brand and embodies our relentless focus on innovation and the belief that every change creates an opportunity to better meet client needs. We have a new story to tell. We built a stronger and more vibrant company. We now offer more boutique specialization on a global scale. Our clients have access to the specialist and expertise they need, while enjoying the confidence that comes with working with a firm of our size. Let me wrap up by saying that none of our accomplishments would be possible if it weren\u2019t for our dedicated employees. I\u2019d like to thank them for their ongoing focus on the client, which has helped our business to thrive for the last 75 years and positions us well for the next 75. And now, we would like to open the call up to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, Jenny, Matt. Hope you are both doing well and congrats on the positive net flow inflection. Matthew Nicholls : Good morning. Jenny Johnson : Thank you. Craig Siegenthaler : So, my question is on your strategic initiative in the SMA business. Now that you have O'Shaughnessy\u2019s direct indexing platform Canvas, which really complements the leading business you got from Legg Mason on the SMA side. I wanted to get an update on your overall SMA strategy. And specifically, which client verticals do you see the biggest opportunities? Because I am assuming RIA is probably a big one. And then also, what Franklin SMA products specifically do you think are going to have the best net flow trajectory here? Jenny Johnson : I will start out and then have Adam jump in. I mean, I think we all feel like with what technology is enabling is just much greater customization. And so while something like Canvas is fantastic for direct indexing, we really do think that its capabilities merge with our SMA platform, you will be able to take active strategies and make them more tax efficient. As a matter of fact, Canvas has been growing that platform while on a small base on the direct indexing side, has grown almost twice the industry just since we even announced it and it\u2019s really driven, because they have an outstanding technology platform that enables them to take it really in what many of the platforms have with a lot of \u2013 are handling manually, they have actually been able to program it. So, we think that the future SMAs just continue to grow. And honestly that it\u2019s across the board, I think, in all channels. But some are already more comfortable with it than others. And Adam, do you want to talk a little bit more about that? Adam Spector : Sure. Making sure I am not on mute here. I would say that the growth is really differentiated depending on if we are talking about Canvas or our more traditional SMA business. The traditional SMA business was really strongest at the wires, because that\u2019s where Legg Mason had its traditional strength. We have been really pleased over the last year at the significant cross-selling such that we now see real growth in SMA and our regional partners as well as with legacy FT products, FT fixed income, you need some of the equity products there as well. So we are getting more product breadth there and we are also spreading out of the wires. In terms of Canvas, we have already essentially tripled the number of RIAs that are using that platform. They are really focused on that platform. And we think for Canvas, we need to continue to grow the platform in that area. At the same time, we are working to expand into newer areas like the traditional broker-dealer market for Canvas, where we think we can use it more to create investment products as opposed to it serving as an entire platform in the broker-dealer world. So, that cross-selling strategy is really what\u2019s key for us. We want to move in both directions and we are seeing that. There is not really one product or one asset class that I would say you will see the most growth in. What we are actually pleased about is the breadth we have been able to achieve in the SMA growth over the last year. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Jenny and Adam. I just have one follow-up for Matt, more of an accounting type question. But I know you guys include your realizations in the AUM roll forward in market appreciation or beta. At this point because you are much bigger and all, it\u2019s much bigger in private markets and you just did the Lexington acquisition, why not in the future breakout realization separately, because I think it would help us from our modeling side of things? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Good morning, Craig. We may do that, I\u2019d say, in the next 12 months as we continue to assess the breadth of our alternative asset business. Out of the $140 million of performance fees that we just reported, $30 million was realizations. I think the size of our performance fees reflects the potential of our larger alternatives business. Obviously, this excludes Lexington at this stage. The December quarter is probably the highest performance the quarter that we will have, because it\u2019s the quarter where we have both realizations quarterly performance fees, and annual performance fees. I\u2019d also note that out of the $140 million, about $40 million of that was specifically annual related. The rest is actually pretty hard to quantify accurately, in our view, from a guidance perspective. But we are going to increase our guidance on performance fees from $10 million to $15 million, which is where we were on the guidance front to $30 million to $40 million for the second quarter. So, I know that\u2019s a longer answer to your question, Craig, but we are going to study this further to see if we can provide more granular information to be useful to modeling. It\u2019s very difficult. The performance fees are very broad and they are in different categories, but we will do our best to provide better guides where we can. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Matt. And just to highlight, my question was a little more on the AUM realization side of things and the performance fee revenue side of things, but I heard your response that you guys are looking into it? So, thank you for taking my questions. Matthew Nicholls : Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. I wanted to start with the alts business for a couple of minutes. I think on the last call, you talked about, I think, about $1 billion in management fees or maybe total revenues that the pro forma business would generate, I guess pro forma flex. I think that was the number. How are you guys thinking about the organic growth on that $1 billion or so in revenues? What\u2019s sort of the organic base growth you expect the collection of these businesses could produce for Franklin over time? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, Alex. I think, candidly, the $1 billion pro forma for Lexington is probably already fairly conservative. We would hope that, that would be close to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, post closing, the 12 months thereafter plus performance fees. So we have been growing the business over the last couple of years that at a growth rate of about 20%. I think I have mentioned in the past that about half of that is organic. The other half is through market growth. So I think we\u2019d say minimum of 10%, but in our view, it should be between 10% and 20% with respect to the growth rate for our combined alternatives business. Alex Blostein : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe in terms of guidance, I heard you talk about performance fees for the second quarter if there is any other guidance things you want to flesh out related to expenses, maybe that would be helpful as well, just kind of how you are thinking about the standalone Franklin pre-Lexington expense base for the rest of the fiscal year? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, okay. So there is a few parts of this to try and be as useful as possible. Obviously, it\u2019s not easy in the current volatile market to get this exactly right, but I am going to spend most of my time talking about the annual number and then we can go from there. So the first point I\u2019d make is that the first quarter that we are just reporting today includes $15 million of one-time benefit to G&A. I think most of you have pointed that out already. So, that\u2019s good. And the second quarter includes a restart of calendar year comp costs such as annual merit increases, payroll taxes, 401(k) match, etcetera. However, we expect our comp ratio to remain in the 43% to 44% area, inclusive of performance fee compensation. And then I\u2019d note that 35% to 40% of our total expense base is variable with market and performance. And as we have mentioned beforehand, we are consistently reviewing the other 60% to 65% in terms of long-term potential operational efficiencies. So what this all means at this point, inclusive of the market that we\u2019ve experienced over the last few weeks is that we still expect our full year \u201822 operating expenses to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, excluding performance fees and excluding Lexington. Alex Blostein : Very helpful. Thanks so much. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions as well. Jenny, maybe one for you in your supplemental management commentary that came out also at the same time in the press release, you spoke to some pretty good breadth in the retail alternative space. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more strategically how you sort of see the opportunity for sort of take advantage of the democratization opportunity, maybe U.S., non-U.S.? And then the converse is a franchise like WAMCO disintermediated just given its more traditional fixed income portfolio? Jenny Johnson : Yes. Thanks, Bill, so first of all, I can tell you, this is the passion within Franklin because of the excess returns that you\u2019re seeing in the private markets. If you think about a company with Franklin\u2019s history that started out because the average person couldn\u2019t access the equity markets. And people came up with the idea, let\u2019s consolidate so that the masses can get access to the excess returns in the equity markets. Well, that same thing exists today. There are half the number of public equities that there were in 2000, and there are 5x the number of backed private firms, equity firms than there were in 2000. And the differential \u2013 so first of all, from an active management, the disparity in returns between good managers and bad managers is dramatic. And number two, the returns over the public markets are significant, right? So we\u2019ve to figure out as a society, we feel a calling to figure out how to bring these types of products responsibly to the mass market. And so when I say responsibly, it\u2019s the running with scissors kind of scenario where the average investor needs access to their money and their savings because of a single event that happens in their life. And so they are tied up in a long-term private assets, that can be a problem. So we think there is interesting way to do that. And so when you ask, well, what\u2019s the market opportunity, just take the four largest wire houses in the U.S. There are about $13 trillion in assets. They have somewhere depending on the firm, an average 4% to 5% in the off space. 1% increase by just those four wire houses, and we\u2019ve talked to them, they\u2019d like to increase their allocations somewhere between 10% and 12% is $130 billion added to the private markets. So it\u2019s \u2013 we think that everybody feels the firms that we\u2019ve talked to recognize the need to be able to do it, recognize the need to be able to come up with appropriate products to bring it to that channel. And the same phenomenon that exists in the U.S. exist in other markets with those disparity of returns. So we think that the \u2013 to answer your question, we think it\u2019s very, very big. Adam Spector : And I would just add one thing is that in terms of Western being disintermediated. Just remember that they have got really strong alternative product on their own, very strong in the CLO space, their global macro opportunities fund is very strong, so not a concern there. That\u2019s the only thing I would add. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you, Adam, for that follow-up. Jenny Johnson : I\u2019m going to just add one other thing. This is actually where we think it could be interesting. We\u2019re looking at product development where you provide say, a BSP private credit, although WAMCO has some private credit book, private credit combined as an allocation within a closed-end fund with Western. So I mean this is where we think that having the breadth of capabilities really can bring some interesting products to the retail market. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, I cut you up both twice there. Just a follow-up question maybe for Matt. Just thank you for the updated annual guidance on expenses. Can you just sort of elaborate on what your market assumptions are? And as you think about those performance fees, is that first calendar quarter guidance now a sort of a normal quarterly run rate? Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. The performance fee guidance there was really just for the second quarter, Bill. But again, we\u2019re going to try our best to provide additional guidance as we roll through the year as our alternative asset business continues to expand, we do expect our performance fee potential to continue to increase. So that\u2019s that piece. In terms of the market assumption, I took into account in the guidance there for the year, the market as of a few days ago when the market was down double digits for the NASDAQ and pretty close to that for the S&P 500 and certainly to Russell 2000, for example, and the fixed income indices down a little bit less. But one of the things I\u2019ll note on the top line, while we don\u2019t provide revenue guidance for the business that when markets decline, I think you\u2019re obviously very aware of this, but when the markets decline, our revenue declines a lot less than the market. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve diversified the business so significantly over the past several years, in particular. And as our ops business becomes larger, and we\u2019ve got other sticky businesses like wealth and parts of the SMA franchise now and some of the institutional business that it\u2019s just much more sticky and less prone to sharp market declines on the revenue front. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d address that question without giving any more guidance on the revenue side, Bill. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you for that color and thank you for all the questions. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious about the $7.4 billion inflows that was from a lift-out, could you please \u2013 I\u2019m sure there is sort of a definitional reason here, but normally, when we think about lift-outs, we think of that is flowing through the acquisition line. So what was the nuance around that where it flowed through on the flow line rather than the acquisition line? Thanks. Adam Spector : Yes. That\u2019s a really good question, thank you. Because we do feel that this is a very specific circumstance. If you look at something like the O\u2019Shaughnessy, that is much more of a typical purchase of the firm where the assets of the firm, including the actual assets under management come with it. What we did with the form of Visa team was quite different. That was an investment team that was essentially going to move to a new home. We were really pleased that when they had a number of platforms that they were looking at, they chose the Franklin platform because they thought it would be best for their clients. They moved over as new employees to Franklin with absolutely zero assets and zero contractual relationships with any client. They then were able to reach out to those clients and contract with them in to really essentially start a new business relationship with Franklin Templeton. So that AUM was not purchased. We simply hired the people. We were thrilled that their clients and the consultants that back those clients saw the strength in the platform such that we actually brought over more AUM than they had at the time of the announcement. So I think that\u2019s a testament to the strength that others see in the Franklin platform. But because we didn\u2019t purchase any assets, that\u2019s why it came through the flow line. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks for that clarification. And then when we think about, Matt, I know it\u2019s challenging here and thanks for all the color in trying to think about the business ex-performance fee and ex-Lexington. Do you have any view on how to think about the core fee rate ex-performance fees and ex-Lexington from here? Should we think about just along with the industry, continued downward pressure or do you have some visibility in any divergence from that overall path? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Brendan, so firstly, I think we feel pretty good about where our effective fee rate is excluding performance fees and excluding Lexington at this point. I think we were just very slightly down in the quarter versus last quarter based on a mix shift into institutional, which is slightly lower fee business from retail. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really impact our fee rate versus necessarily larger fee cuts, for example, because we think we\u2019re very much generally in line, maybe even a bit lower than industry average in certain areas that have been under the most pressure there. So I think we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at. Obviously, when we include Lexington into the mix, hopefully beginning into the second \u2013 well, I guess, it will be the third quarter when we report it. But obviously, that\u2019s going to have an upward pressure on the \u2013 on that fee rate because their fee rate is much higher on their AUM. So in a way, we have \u2013 it creates a little bit more of a cushion for potential to increase the EFR a little bit based on bringing Lexington in. And then as we\u2019ve said beforehand, with our strategy to continue to grow the alternatives business, if we continue to be successful in that regard assuming that the equity market is relatively stable, let\u2019s say, and that we don\u2019t suddenly have tremendously stronger flows than expected into institutional fixed income business, which is lower fees or money markets, for example, we feel pretty good about where the fee rate is and potentially with the growing alts business even a little bit of an increase from where we\u2019re at today. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color, Matthew. And you didn\u2019t mention the closing date expectation changing. Should we still count on 3/31 generally? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, it would probably be April 1, just for accounting reasons, it\u2019s so complicated to try to take something at the end of the \u2013 directly at the end of the quarter and having to include it all in that quarter when we report a couple a few weeks later. So we\u2019re more likely than not \u2013 we think we\u2019re on track, made very good progress to close around April 1. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thanks very much. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. Matthew Nicholls : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. So the improvement year-on-year in flows extra distributions was significantly lower redemptions. I think gross sales were kind of flat year-on-year. And you talked about the investments in all selections coming onboard and all that. I want to talk about what you think specifically can drive better gross sales for, let\u2019s say, for the rest of this year? And then within there maybe if you could touch on what to expect in fixed income, in other words, there is been downside pressure on fixed income allocations. Now we have an inflationary back shop rates are going to rise some version of a lot according to many people. What do you think that\u2019s going to drive product-wise across your platform as the year progresses? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : So first, thanks, Glenn for question. And you may recognize some of those stats on the growth of vault in the retail channel. So thank you for those. The \u2013 our \u2013 you just take our U.S. obviously, by far, our biggest channel. On the retail side, we\u2019ve grown that gross sales by about 13% in the last year versus the industry of 7% to 10%, right? So obviously, in a place where we\u2019re getting it right, we\u2019re seeing good growth and much greater diversification of assets and \u2013 which has been \u2013 the one challenge we had historically is you had a couple of products that accounted for an outsized portion. Now it\u2019s much more diverse. We\u2019ve had positive flows in U.S. and EMEA. And then in places like Asia, we had some hiccups in some markets, which have held us down, but actually seeing the same kind of positive in certain markets, same kind of positive growth that we see in the U.S. and Europe. So we think we\u2019re we have some places where we had vulnerability and still some lumpy redemptions. But overall, what we have intended to do, which is diversify our business from a product standpoint, from a geographic standpoint and from a client standpoint that we\u2019re doing that well, we\u2019re definitely seeing growth above the industry. So I\u2019ll put that there. And then on the fixed income side, look, a couple of things, so first of all, we have multiple franchises in the fixed income, which have different views, honestly, on things like inflation and rates and actually had low correlation of where their alpha comes from. So that\u2019s a good news, right? Again, that diversification is really important. And then if you think about fixed income, look, rising rate environment is actually good for active management on the fixed income side, and that\u2019s because you get, say, spread assets tend to outperform when rates go up. You have things like private credit, direct lending, leveraged loans. All of those things tend to be a place where you can get better returns. So the story on fixed become is not just duration. And we think with the capabilities that we have, we\u2019re well poised for where portfolios have to allocate to fixed income. Not to mention that there is a bunch of cash sitting on the sidelines that when rates go up, you think you\u2019ll be able to coke some of that back into the fixed income market. So we don\u2019t think the story is just rates are going to go up and anybody who has a large fixed income franchise is going to be hurting from it. We actually think there is some real positive story there. Adam Spector : Glenn. And I would add just a couple of things to that, in that sales are kind of modestly up. Redemptions are significantly down. We\u2019re happy with both of those. But the other thing that isn\u2019t as evident in the number is the significant cross-selling we\u2019ve had in terms of platform access. And now that we are now able to onboard, for instance, Italy is a great example where FT, legacy FT had a lot of the largest banks, all the largest banks, they have platform access there. Legacy Leg had a lot of great investment products, but it wasn\u2019t on the platform. We onboarded that product to the four largest bank platforms in Italy this quarter. We have exchangeability coming up at the end of this month in the U.S. So, all of those things augur quite well for better future sales. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and good morning, everyone. Maybe as a follow-up to that, Adam, talking about getting more cross-selling on platforms, I believe this was kind of a key year post the merger to kind of start seeing that leverage. So what should we be looking for? Is it very simply just an acceleration in gross sales or is there some type of mix that we should be thinking about as you kind of try to leverage enhanced platform placement? Just how from the outside looking in, should we really kind of measure that or make it measurable, the success? Adam Spector : I think there are a couple of things. There is a number of advisers who are using us. That\u2019s one of the most significant things. And are they using just one half of the house or the entire product range. We\u2019ve seen significant growth there. Two is, I think you\u2019ll see significantly lower redemption rates going forward to the extent that anyone is ever unsatisfied with the particular investment product now that we have double the products on the platform, essentially, there is an ability to switch from one to the other in still today within the Franklin Templeton platform, so more number of advisers buying our products and buying a larger breadth and greater retention. The other thing that we\u2019ve seen historically is that the larger number of products that one adviser buys from you, the stickier their assets are with you long-term because you tend to develop a better kind of holistic relationship with them, not just in asset management product sale relationship. So as you see more products per adviser, I think you see a stickier AUM base as well. Jenny Johnson : Sorry, just to add to that. This TA conversion this month is really significant in the sense that for the first time, we\u2019re able to do exchanges. And there are some big firms that have just said, if you\u2019re unable to do exchanges, we can\u2019t add those other products on the platform. So while we\u2019ve seen some improvement in cross-selling of advisers who used to be either just Legg Mason or Franklin, we should \u2013 the real improvement should be happening now that Adam and team are doing their job. Robert Lee : Great. And I guess it\u2019s more metrics for Matt to give us down the road. Matthew Nicholls : I\u2019ll add it to the next, Rob. Robert Lee : Okay, great. Maybe as a follow-up for Jenny, so you did the North Capital transaction, you made the investment in CAIS, which I know is a big capital raise. Within the alternative businesses, I mean, how do you see those or maybe other technology investments fitting in your strategy? Is it really just more \u2013 does it give you enhanced access having those stakes? Is it \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what you feel like that brings to the table for you? Jenny Johnson : Yes. You just take case, right. So, what is case-to-case offers to streamline for the retail, anybody who has invested in private assets to know what a nightmare it is to have to deal with all the forms and signing up for these things. And so case tried to streamline that, making it much easier for an advisor to give his clients access to the alternative platform. If you are an investor, you have the ability to have the conversation about where you are and what gets showcased and gives you more of a pull position to be able to showcase your products. It doesn\u2019t mean that they are going to be closed architecture. But again, shelf space and shelf businessing is always very important. So, that\u2019s partly how we think about the fintech investments that we do. Matthew Nicholls : It\u2019s also, Rob, frankly, it\u2019s a little bit of co-opetition, if you will, in the sense that this is such a giant space, and it\u2019s just going to become larger and larger. So, our view of it is, even though we are investing ourselves significantly as Adam and Jenny mentioned, in the distribution of alternative assets under out directly. We think partnering with others that are focused specifically on different areas of what from a distribution, servicing technology perspective. It just further enhances our own investments internally and frankly, provides us with more opportunities across the business. So, that\u2019s what we are most focused on, and we have really enjoyed our time with these companies, learning from them and hopefully then learning from us and they are getting generally more access. Robert Lee : Great. And if I could squeeze in one quick one on the sale of Embark since it\u2019s on technology. Should we expect there is going to be a noticeable kind of gain that flows through in the second quarter, just for modeling purposes? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. The gain will \u2013 is approximately $50 million. Robert Lee : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So, I kind of wanted to follow-up just in terms of M&A and the go forward with Lexington closing here in the coming months. But still having plenty of liquidity, and you guys have been highly active over the last kind of 1.5 years, 2 years. How should we think about your appetite for more investments and/or M&A going forward? Matthew Nicholls : Well, I think I will start, Jenny, and then \u2013 there you go. I think as we have described, Dan, before, per annum after you take into consideration the dividend that\u2019s very important and then the share repurchases, which would always do enough to at least hedge our employee grants to level out the share count. After that, if you roughly look at the net income that we add to the firm, it\u2019s over $1 billion. So, every year, that $1 billion, we look at that and say, okay, in addition to what we have got in our balance sheet today and the financial flexibility that we have and now the new revolver that we have, it provides significant flexibility for us to continue to add to alternative assets to wealth management and to our distribution strategies that we have talked about. And until we run out of those things to do to enhance and further diversify our business for our company, our shareholders and very importantly, our clients, obviously, because this is what they are demanding. We will continue to down that path. So, M&A opportunities to further diversify our business, expand what we have, invest importantly internally in our specialist investment managers and then we get to share repurchase after that. And obviously, the dividend is central to us. But we do have the capacity to do something meaningful every year in theory. What we have also said though is that if we \u2013 at some point, we will run out of those things to do, and we will be very comfortable with everything that we have from a business \u2013 overall business mix perspective. At that point, we will then think about accelerating share repurchases and increasing our dividend more significantly. Dan Fannon : Great. And then just a follow-up and I appreciate the guidance that\u2019s already been given around expenses. But you did realize the last remaining component of the Legg Mason synergies. And so as you think about the guidance for this year, does that contemplate further potential optimization of any of those businesses, or is it kind of just based, as you said on AUM levels here and kind of what your business planning as you see it? Matthew Nicholls : No, I think it\u2019s based mostly on where we see the markets today at this point. And I think I have said before that we do have some additional levers to pull if we need to, given that, for example, wage inflation, competitive environment for talent, we are obviously extremely focused on that. Again, we think our compensation ratio is highly competitive. It shows that we are paying for what we need to pay for to get the best people at the firm and retain and attract and the rest of it. So, we are very focused on that, but we are more likely to use those levers at least in the next 12 months to ensure that we can continue to manage our expenses at the guidance we have given versus trying to come in much lower than that. But as we said, we certainly do have those levers to pull. Jenny mentioned earlier on about the TA outsourcing. The TA outsourcing itself, per se, is mostly about savings to the funds, which is terrific. The service is going to be tremendous, unique, as Jenny mentioned, as we have announced, but it also saves money for the funds. For us, it becomes about functions supporting the TA. And at some point in the next year, we will get to dig into all those things and see if we can be more efficient in other places. And that\u2019s what I define as another lever internally. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning guys. Matthew Nicholls : Good morning. Patrick Davitt : Matthew, given your background in asset manager M&A, perhaps more broadly, could you kind of frame your views through your experience of how \u201822 could look from a pipeline standpoint given the more volatile markets and maybe any thoughts around your view of it potentially being different than your historical experience for any reason? Matthew Nicholls : Okay. I think the first thing I would say is that whatever the market conditions, there is no such thing, in our opinion, in buying something really good for a lower price just because the markets are lower. They are simply not for sale at that point in time. So, just make that point clear. I think the pipeline, what we are seeing in terms of the pipeline across alternative assets and wealth management, in particular, is very significant. I don\u2019t think we have ever seen it as active. And I don\u2019t really see that changing going into 2022. In wealth management, there is a fair amount of consolidation happening and a lot of opportunity to offer increased services and support to ever-increasing demands from complex client needs. So, that\u2019s happening in wealth. And Fiduciary Trust is a tremendous business, a tremendous platform. It\u2019s got its store, history and brand that we can utilize to attract excellent businesses. As we have mentioned, the two acquisitions that we have made through Fiduciary Trust, which is Petrus and Raytheon have grown collectively by, I think, 40% to 45% since the acquisition announcement a little over 18 months or 2 years ago or so. So, that\u2019s one. And then in the alternative asset arena, it\u2019s incredibly busy on a global level, in particular, in Europe, in the United States, I would say. And while we are very comfortable with what we have acquired and we are very excited, frankly, even if we did nothing else with what we have under the tent here. We do see a couple of other important sectors within alternative assets that we think we can help grow and would be an important offering for our clients and our shareholders at Franklin, therefore, will benefit from that when we \u2013 if we come to acquire those things. But \u2013 so I see the pipeline as being very strong. Opportunities are meaningful. There is a lot of competition for these things, both in wealth and alternative assets. But I think we have \u2013 I have already referred to Fiduciary Trust. And I think we are really excited about our narrative and how it has resonated with some of the leading companies out there, most recently, Lexington, for example, where I think we were an extremely good company around Lexington. And while it wasn\u2019t a wide process because it didn\u2019t need to be, there were some extremely credible parts involved in that. And we were excited that, that company chose Franklin. So, that is sort of the update on the M&A front. I don\u2019t know if Jenny or Adam, do you want to add anything? Adam Spector : No. Jenny Johnson : You got it. Patrick Davitt : Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. One quick one on \u2013 I think, Matthew, you said you expect the pro forma Lexington revenue to be more like $1.2 billion-plus. Anything specific you can point to driving that, or is it just kind of better visibility on their fundraising pipeline at this point? Matthew Nicholls : I think it\u2019s really across all of the ops. I mean Clarion is \u2013 and Benefits Street Partners have their own really meaningful opportunities. Clarion in the real estate arena, it has very strong performance, has really meaningful growth and an exciting pipeline and they fortunately are exposed to the areas that are experiencing the most significant growth. So for us, that\u2019s tremendous. And same with Benefit Street Partners, the alternative credit area. We think that the potential to globalize that business and be larger in another geography is exciting for us. So, I think it\u2019s those two things. And then we unfortunately can\u2019t comment on Lexington\u2019s fundraising processes or anything like that, we will be able to comment on that in our May make or after we have closed Lexington. But I will just say that everything is going very much to plan as it relates to Lexington and we are really excited to be closing that in April. And the guide that we gave on both revenue, which I think we said for \u2013 on an annualized basis, it would be $350 million for Lexington and on an EBITDA level around $150 million, we would continue to stick with that guide. Jenny Johnson : And let me just add one thing on that. Again, we have talked about the opportunity in the retail space for alternatives. I mean we feel incredibly fortunate to have the properties that we have with the outstanding performance that they have. You just look at Clarion and you look at some of the competitors in the retail space and assets coming in and Clarion\u2019s performance competes head-to-head, no problem in that space. We have a tremendous reputation in the retail space. The challenge there is it\u2019s actually really hard because there is a whole education process that happens with any kind of manager. So, that takes some time to be able to bring an alternatives capability in the retail. But to have the types of products that we have and the distribution capability, we are focused on solving kind of that education component of it. And then I would just say that if you are going to bring private equity to the retail space, secondaries, we think is a better way to do it because you don\u2019t have the J curve issue that you have in the institutional space there. And so Lexington, we think is just a great opportunity. So, you have the products, you have the reputation and now it\u2019s just figuring out how to sell it. So, that\u2019s kind of the final component. Patrick Davitt : It\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Stephanie Ma : Good morning. This is Stephanie filling in for Mike. I just have a quick follow-up on the performance fees. Matt, can you just remind us of the arrangement with Clarion and when those legacy pass-through performance fees, when that starts coming on, if not already? And how meaningful could that be to the performance to the outlook? Matthew Nicholls : Thank you for the question. That\u2019s actually already happened. So, our performance fee arrangement with Clarion with respect to pass-through fees, the pass-throughs are almost zero now. Stephanie Ma : Great. Thanks. And then maybe just lastly on the pipeline, the $13 billion this quarter, wondering if you can give us some color on how the asset cost mix has evolved or some of the different types of mandates or fee rates sitting in the pipeline now, how that\u2019s trended versus last quarter? Adam Spector : Yes. There is not really a significant change there. I would say, from an asset class perspective, fixed income is the largest percentage of that, but we also have a very, very healthy dose of alternatives and equities in there as well. There was really a slight change in the overall level, but that does not at all reflect the strength of the institutional business. In fact, I would tell you, we are doing better and better in the institutional space. The truth is what that\u2019s really measuring is business that you have won, but hasn\u2019t actually funded yet. So, to the extent that you fund the business more quickly, that number will actually come down a bit. So, the institutional business is really quite strong. Fixed income is the biggest asset class, but a big chunk of fixed income is roughly half of it. In terms of fee rates, really, I would say we haven\u2019t seen a change in the fees that we are doing institutional business that over the last few quarters. Matthew Nicholls : And just back to performance fees a second. I think maybe one guide that could be helpful because I think in the past, we said 50-50, just the rough guide on comp to revenue, performance fee revenue. I would just update modeling to make that 55%. Because when we look at the mix of performance fees now, and we calculate where we think that\u2019s heading and we think assuming 55% performance fees become compensation, I think is a better model than 50%. Stephanie Ma : Great. Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. And I was just curious maybe just going back to expenses. When you did the Legg transaction, one of the things that you made points that you weren\u2019t going to touch at least initially, was the NAV kind of relationships with the investment affiliates in the Western and whatnot. So, that was maybe left for a later date. And then maybe this is \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is touching a third rail or not, but 18 months in, things are starting to click. Is there an opportunity to revisit any of those that may help efficiency or cost overall for the company? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean, we \u2013 firstly, we don\u2019t \u2013 we certainly don\u2019t think of that as a third rail, Rob. We have very open, great dialogue with all of our company and in fact, most of the leadership of the largest specialist investment managers or on our management committee or executive committee. So, we have very open discussions about these things and we are all in this together to be as efficient as we can. I would just \u2013 I would say that in terms of our focus internally, we have a long list of things and potential that we are working through. We have got enough potential from a cost synergy perspective outside of some of those larger specialist investment management components of the fund that you are talking about. Our focus with those aspects of the company is all about revenue and growth opportunities. And we do talk about expenses and we talk about \u2013 so for example, when we talk about the transformation, we talk about fund administration, we talk about other technology services across the company. It\u2019s not just sort of a holding company FT discussion. It\u2019s a discussion involving all the specialist investment managers. And we can see in future years, there will be absolutely obvious areas where we will collectively bring expenses down as the company. But we also are a conservative company. We are very methodical. It has to be one thing at a time. And frankly, we have got enough to get on with outside of what you are specifically referring to, and therefore, we are able to focus more on growth opportunities and revenue with the specialist investment managers, legacy Legg Mason. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for the added color. I appreciate it. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you, Rob. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin\u2019s President and CEO, for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Great. Well, thank you, everybody, for participating in today\u2019s call. We have made a lot of exciting progress. And in so many ways, I can tell you, we just feel like we are getting started. So once again, we would like to thank our employees for their hard work and remaining absolutely focused on our clients and on each other. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again next quarter. So, thank you, everybody, and stay healthy. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical or forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you Salene. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our second fiscal quarter. I'm joined by Matt Nicholls, our CFO, who recently expanded his responsibilities to include Chief Operating Officer; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. This quarter global financial markets were impacted by a continuation of macroeconomic pressures due to increased inflation and related higher interest rates, both of which have been significantly exacerbated by geopolitical and economic shifts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war. This quarter's volatile market environment challenged industry flows particularly in taxable fixed income strategies. We were impacted by these pressures and had $11.7 billion in long-term net outflows, although we continue to drive net inflows into key growth areas and our effective fee rate remains stable. The heightened market volatility and implications of a rapidly changing investment environment remind us of the importance of the investments we've made over the past several years to diversify our business to better serve our clients through all market conditions. Our investment teams each look at the market through a different lens to provide deep expertise and investment specialization. For instance, if you look at our fixed income franchise, Brandywine Global, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Templeton Global Macro and Western Asset each of these specialist investment managers has a different interest rate outlook, resulting in varying investment outcomes across our products. And although we saw net outflows in certain US and global taxable strategies those were partially offset by inflows into short duration bank loans and corporate strategies. Additionally, we've been able to benefit as investors look to reposition their portfolios in search for yield across asset classes. Our flagship income fund and alternative asset strategies of Benefit Street Partners and Clarion Partners, for example, represent important diversification tools for our clients. BSP and Clarion have been key contributors to our success and generated a combined $2 billion in long-term net inflows during the second quarter and each reached record highs in assets under management. Our multi-asset class category recorded $2.3 billion in positive net flows for the quarter, driven by the Franklin Income Fund that has an approach that is adjustable to changing market conditions with $75 billion in US AUM, the income fund has also seen increased interest from investors in Asia and Europe and the strategy was recently launched into the SMA vehicle to meet client demand. To illustrate how we've been able to diversify into other strategies 17 of our top 20 funds with net inflows are outside of our largest 20 funds and on average now exceed $5 billion in AUM. Close connectivity with our customers during periods of market uncertainty is extremely important as investors look to reposition their portfolios and we've been actively engaging with our clients with thought leadership Franklin Templeton Institute and our specialist investment managers to help navigate how geopolitical and macroeconomic shifts impact their investment decisions and their long-term financial goals. Specifically, webinar attendance by financial advisers grew by 62% in the second quarter and video views increased by 90%. Turning to investment performance. Strong long-term investment performance resulted in 65%, 68% and 77% of our strategy composite AUM outperforming their respective benchmarks over a three, five and 10-year period. There was a decrease in our one-year investment performance primarily due to certain US taxable fixed income strategies which was partially offset by strong performance in global fixed income strategies with notable improvements in performance for Templeton Global Bond Fund whose performance is in the top decile for the one-year period. We continue to make progress on our corporate initiatives, which include growing alternative assets, advancing technology to customize portfolios in our SMAs and expanding our presence in wealth management and ETFs. Our alternative asset business continues to develop growing 2.3% from the prior quarter to a record $158 billion in AUM with contributions from a diverse group of strategies including the aforementioned $2 billion of net inflows into Benefit Street Partners and Clarion Partners. On April 1, we completed our acquisition of Lexington Partners a leading global manager of secondary private equity and co-investment funds with total AUM of $57 billion as of March 31. That AUM will be included in our quarterly reporting starting in the third quarter and we expect further growth as a result of new fundraising. When including Lexington, Franklin Templeton increased its presence in alternatives by 39% to become a $215 billion manager of alternative assets, an area of increasing importance for both individual and institutional investors. SMA AUM ended the quarter at $126.1 billion. We continued to make progress with SMA strategies particularly in use of technology to customize portfolios. This quarter Canvas our recently acquired custom indexing solution increased by 21% in AUM driven by net inflows of $600 million and the number of partnerships grew by 15%. Wealth Management AUM ended the quarter at $34.1 billion. Fiduciary Trust International generated its sixth quarter of consecutive positive long-term net inflows and we continue to explore ways to accelerate growth of the business via acquisitions. We also experienced growth in our ETF business in the quarter with positive net flows and approximately $13 billion in AUM, which are balanced between actively managed and passive strategies. Looking briefly at our financial results, adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion a decrease of 6% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower average AUM two fewer calendar days and a decrease in performance fees. Expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter, but would have been lower had it not been for non-recurring or certain episodic items that are included in our adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $577 million, and importantly, our adjusted effective fee rate stayed relatively consistent at 38.5 basis points. With $6.8 billion in cash and investments as of March 31, the ongoing strength of our balance sheet enables us to invest with confidence in the business and make sure we're positioned appropriately in an ever-evolving industry. In closing, it's a transformative time in the asset management industry, while the economic climate and geopolitical tensions present additional complexities and uncertainties. Over the past two years, we've made significant strides to expand our capabilities and provide our clients with deep expertise and specialization. It's this broad diversity that is allowing us to navigate through the current volatility. I would like to thank our employees for their tireless work and ongoing efforts on behalf of our clients. Now, let's turn it over to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, Jenny, Matt. Hope you both doing well. And Matt congrats on the CEO appointment. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Craig Siegenthaler : So given your large fixed income franchise across Western Brandywine and Franklin, I wanted to get your perspective on how investors are reacting to rising rates. And my question really is, are you seeing a different flow pattern or behavior between the retail and institutional channel. And then when the money is leaving, do you see where it's going? Is it going into cash, private credit, equities? And are you able to recapture it? Jenny Johnson : I'm going to let Adam get into details, but I mean, we're definitely seeing good flows into like short-duration bank loans corporate strategies. I mean, so there \u2013 so it's not all \u2013 there's more of a kind of a shift in where it's going. But Adam, do you want to go into a little bit more detail? Adam Spector : Sure. Thanks, Jenny. First of all, I would say that the changes that, we've seen are not really all that different on the institutional and the retail side. We see pretty similar patterns going on right now. That's really a part I think driven by the fact of how professional the wealth channel is these days. I don't see it behaving that much differently than the institutional channel. What we've seen is that, core type strategies intermediate duration was hit the worst. I think, if you take a look at active flows for US mutual funds as an example for the month of March, the industry without something like $71 billion and 75% or so of that, was in core taxable fixed income. So that part of the market got hit really, really hard. Where is that money going? As Jenny see, we see short duration picking up a lot. Our short duration sales in some of our funds, was up over 80%. We see it going to some credit strategies floating rate and importantly also, to private credit, where we're a significant player. And that in part is propelling the growth in our alts business, where in our private markets businesses as Jenny said earlier, we had $2 billion worth of growth in the quarter. The other place especially in some of our wealth channels that we've seen a pivot to is alternative sources of yield to fixed income. And we're really pleased that we have the ability to offer our clients the income fund which is one of our largest funds at Franklin and one of our top really flow generators for the quarter where we saw an increase in our net of over $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I think we have to assume some of that money from fixed income is following to their. So we feel good Craig in general about being able to retain a portion of the outflows even though the segment where we're strongest had the worst outflows in the industry. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you for that. And just as my follow-up on a similar topic, as we try to forecast the model bond flows, do you think it gets worse from here just because we've only had one rate hike and there could be eight or nine more? And I know that's more of a short duration front end of the curve sort of comment and the long end might matter more, but I would love your perspective on this topic given what you're seeing from clients? Adam Spector : Yeah. I think the good news is one of the themes that we are really pleased to see across the business is the diversification. So if you ask about a number of rate hikes like that it's going to impact our various specialist investment managers in different ways because we have very different and differentiated positioning along the curve. So what I think that means is that regardless of the action the Fed takes, we're going to have products that are in the performance sweet spot where we'll be able to continue. One of the -- continue to grow. One of the things we're really pleased with is the fact that our sales is more diversified than it's ever been before, which means we think we have the ability to grow regardless of the macro environment. Craig Siegenthaler : Adam, thank you for the responses here. Adam Spector : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open, sir. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you so much for taking the questions. So maybe coming to expenses for a moment. I seem to be a few sort of ins and outs as I see it. Just wondering if you could unpack a little bit about what is the right start point for expenses into new quarter? And how should we be thinking about the expense outlook maybe with and without the impact of Lexington? And does the charge you took for TA, does that have any sort of incremental synergies or other impacts as we look out over the next several quarters? Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Okay, Bill. Thank you, good morning. Maybe it's best if I just update some guidance and I'll also give some breakdown inclusive of Lexington, so we can sort of reset where we're at, not give both annual guidance and some quarterly guidance for next quarter on the breakdowns. We expect full year 2022 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion excluding performance fees, but now including Lexington Partners. You may recall, last quarter I had said that our expense guide for 2022 on adjusted operating expenses would be $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion excluding both performance fees and excluding Lexington. But now, it's executing performance fees and including Lexington Partners, so that's one important change due to market conditions and revenues and assets under management and so forth. Given we've now closed Lexington, as I mentioned, I'll give a few line items which I hope will be useful for the third quarter. We expect G&A to be in the range of $140 million again inclusive of Lexington occupancy to be around $57 million and information services and technology to be \u2013 information systems, sorry and technology to be around $125 million and that's all inclusive of Lexington. Bill Katz : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. And maybe coming back to alternatives as my follow-up. Jenny I heard you talk about the sort of the good growth out of Clarion and Benefit Street sort of adding $2 billion but I also think you mentioned you had some outflows on the liquid side. So wondering if you could maybe unpack that a little bit more. And then as you think about Lexington, where are they in their flagship capital raising cycle? And how do you see the opportunity to sort of leverage it more broadly through the Franklin footprint? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Yes. Look so some of the outflows were in some of our macro strategies on the alternative side. As far as Lexington and the capital raise I mean and we're not talking specifically about the fundraise. But if you look at \u2013 when we announced the deal I think they had $34 billion in fee generating revenue \u2013 or AUM and now they're up to $42 billion. And so you can look at comparable secondaries and see sort of how they've done on their rate versus others. And we're really excited about it but we're not giving any more specific details on this particular fund raise. Adam Spector : Jenny, the one thing I might add to that is that the distribution team has been working with Lexington. Obviously, they have a long history of accomplished fundraising on their own. The areas where we think we're going to be able to add the most at Franklin Templeton are in the retail distribution of their products as well as in select markets. We've had a number of examples already where they might be strong in a particular country or segment but they don't quite know everyone in the market or there's a country where they don't really have a presence. So just like we do with the rest of our specialist investment managers, it's really an opt-in model and we've had discussions with them about where they're strong and where they need some help and we're filling in the gaps which we think will help their already strong sales process get even better. Jenny Johnson : And I think actually Adam I think that's a great point. I mean you talk about sort of the big areas of growth. Alternatives is obviously our big area of focus. I mean BCG came out and said 2025, also represent 16% of AUM but 46% of global AUM revenue. So as we all know flows \u2013 all flows aren't created equal. And the big opportunity, we think is in the retail channel you just again take the $13 trillion in assets in the top four largest wirehouses. 1% move is $130 billion and they've all stated that they know that the democratization of alternatives is really important as we've seen the reduction of companies going public and more and more private credit. And so we think taking our vast retail distribution capabilities and marrying it with these alternatives, it's really complicated. There's a lot of training that goes on. It's not just getting it on the platform. There's a lot of material that has to be there but it's just a tremendous opportunity. And Lexington part of their fund raise has been successful in the retail channel. So we're excited about the opportunities. We actually think secondary private equity is a great way because you don't have the J curve issue for the retail or the wealth channel to actually access private equity. Bill Katz : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Bill. And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open, sir. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just had a follow-up on the Matt the expense -- updated expense guide really helpful to hear. What for the full year, does that expectation include what we've seen so far quarter-to-date, or would that be as of 3/31 when you cut that? How should we think about that, when we watch the markets and calibrate for that? Matt Nicholls : It includes market to-date. But of course, we obviously, know how volatile the market is Brandon. And I think we've highlighted in the past that, approximately 35% to 40% of our adjusted expense base is variable, along with market and performance. And I think we've also added to that that the other piece of 60% to 65%, in terms of long-term effectiveness and efficiencies we continue to review. But -- so if the market gets tougher, we're equipped to make moves, further moves. Brennan Hawken : Great. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, -- how is it that you guys -- that way we hear a lot about some competitors continuing to make investments and whatnot. How are you balancing expense discipline and may kind of holding the line with continuing to make investments in the business that are so important to your competitive positioning and maintaining your strength in the marketplace? Jenny Johnson : I think... Matt Nicholls : Oh, go ahead Jenny. Jenny Johnson : Sorry, Matt, I was just going to answer \u2026 Matt Nicholls : Oh, go ahead. Jenny Johnson : \u2026more details but I would say philosophically, you will always see us thinking in terms of what's the long-term right for the business versus any kind of short-term. So we're going to work hard to reduce costs, where we can reduce costs but never at the expense of strategically positioning us for the long-term. So we're making some significant investments in wealth technology for example. And even in the blockchain space and others, because we think they're going to be important over the long run. It will take a little time for us to pay off meaningfully. And hit the bottom-line, but they will be really important for us in the long-term positioning of the business. So go ahead Matt. Matt Nicholls : Yeah the only thing I'd add to that is, I think part of your question Brent is how are we doing that? Where are we finding the money from, when we are managing to reduce expenses and keep up with where the market is going in this volatility? It's basically because we've also been through a very significant merger remember, so when you go through significant mergers even at the holding company level where we focused most of the cost synergies yeah we had that created some flexibility for the company. And it continues to create flexibility for the company in terms of our operation and how we run the firm. And we have to focus on one thing at a time, but we certainly earmarked other areas where we can make moves when we have time to make the moves candidly. So that's where we get the additional flexibility from as we take in. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thanks for all that color. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So Jenny maybe just to, build on, some of your comments around the alternatives and the wealth management and all kind of your aspirations there with Lexington especially coming into the fold now. We've seen a number of players both kind of traditional and the old trying to tackle the channel. But outside of Lexington most people have had a part of time really making a dent at least so far in a sizable way. So maybe help us frame, what the asset base is there today across all, of your kind of illiquid product on the wealth channel, warehouses and the like. And if you look out the next couple of years what would you consider to, be a success? What would you want that to look like? Jenny Johnson : I'm trying to think we publicly mentioned what percentage of our alternatives are in the retail channel. I don't think so. Here's what I would say, it is really complicated. We are digging in -- I think Franklin Templeton has one of the strongest wealth distribution capabilities in the industry. And so probably out of the gate the view was, oh this should be easy. We should be able to take our alternative products and be able to bring them right in that channel. The reality is, it requires -- the simplest thing is to actually get on the platforms. The much more difficult thing is the level of training and detail that's required at each of the financial advisers, their understanding how to sell alternatives into positioning in their products, the marketing material that goes in with that, the reporting, the follow-up reporting capabilities.  And so, like our investment in Case right, that's one of the types of things that enables the streamlining of a wealth manager to be able to bring alternatives. You really have to -- it's if you walk into a kitchen today and we -- the good news is, we have all of the ingredients to be able to deliver really, really well. The difficulty is, it's all about bringing those things together and executing on it to be able to kind of make the best meal. And so, we are putting a lot of resources.  I got to tell you this is one of my probably top two priorities in the firm and our top two priorities is to get this right. And so, we're making sure that we're scaling up our teams to be able to fill the alternatives making sure that we have the specialists within each of our alternatives to be able to address the wealth market, as well as supporting that with the material and the training.  It took Blackstone from what I understand several years, before they were able to really make a dent in the wealth channel. The good news is, they paved the road a bit for the rest of us, but it is complicated. It's more complicated than I think we understood initially. Alex Blostein : Got you. Appreciate it. Jenny Johnson : Adam, you like to add? Adam Spector : Yes, I can add a couple of things to that. We don't break out specifically the illiquid alternatives, but alternatives in general in the retail channel for us are over $14 billion and our gross sales in that channel have been over $1 billion a quarter for the last few quarters. So, we see strong momentum there. And as Jenny said, excellence in that area requires really good product which we think we have, a significant distribution force which we have, good relationships with the home offices, which we have. But then that all need to be, knit together with really superior training, education, product, people, product structuring etcetera. And that's where a lot of our attention is at this point because we think we have all the pieces. It's bringing it together and bringing it into our partner firms. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks so much for that. And my follow-up is, back to Western for a second. Fully appreciate the industry dynamics and we've obviously seen the flows for longer duration, more maybe credit-sensitive funds face a lot of flow headwinds in the last couple of months and that may continue. But as I think about the relative position of Western against some of the other larger bond platforms. The relative investment performance has suffered quite a bit as well and that's not uncommon, I guess in times of more kind of credit or duration-related dislocation for Western, just given the nature of the way they invest. How well understood is that with clients? So in other words, do you guys think that the relative underperformance at Western could have a longer-lasting effect on their ability to recoup some of the outflows that they're seeing right now? Jenny Johnson : I would say a couple of things. So one is I mean you talk to Western and they feel they have a lot of conviction that the market is overestimating the Fed increase. Now we have different fixed income teams Brandywine, Franklin Templeton things to come that believe that that's not the case, right? That's the benefit that we have of diverse managers who are truly independent. And Western is really good at communicating with the clients about their positioning and why they're positioned the way they are. And the one thing is, we've gone back and looked at Western's performance over rising rate cycles and I have to tell you they bounce back very quickly. I mean in 100% of the cases, that we looked at back to 2000 and even before that, within the next six months they outperformed the benchmark. So are they right or wrong? There's strong conviction on their positioning. They have great relationships with clients and they are doing a great job of communicating their positioning. It remains to be seen, whether they're correct or not. Adam Spector : Yes. I'll add a couple of things to that. First of all Jenny said they have great relationships with clients. If you take a look at some of the industry metrics, they are literally off the chart in how they score in terms of their client engagement and client service. So very strong client relationships. And when you talk about performance look they had a one-year period that was really tough as the correlations broke down and their duration hedge didn't pay off against the credit. That's essentially what happened. But look at their long-term performance. 95% of their assets are outperforming on the three-year, 98% are outperforming on the five-year. That is not a manager, that's performance challenge. That's a manager that has soft performance in the short run and our confidence in our sales force still have the utmost confidence in them. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Matt Nicholls : And it's -- Alex it's a different -- it's really addressing a slightly different question, but while we're on the topic, I think it's worth noting from a financial perspective, the operating income impact of the flows you're referencing, I'm not just referencing Western I'm referencing just the broader parts of fixed income are relatively low, compared to the positive operating income impact we're getting from the growth in alternatives and other growth areas that we've referenced. Brennan Hawken : Yes, for sure it\u2019s coming through [indiscernible] Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. Operator : Next we have Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is open Ken Worthington : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on Alex's question and your response to Bill Katz. So from a higher level, can you talk about the integration of the various alternative platforms? So you now have Lexington in the mix like, how are you thinking about -- like where are you going to integrate them? And where are you going to not integrate them? And so maybe start out with distribution. In terms of integrating distribution, are you kind of combining the different alternative sales forces together? Are they being like cross-trained but being kept separate? And then how are you kind of folding their expertise into your broader sales focus? And then the other part of my question is really on product development. How aggressive do you want to be in terms of product development, new products for maybe other distribution channels where you have good relationships in Franklin? And how quickly, can you get those products out? Jenny Johnson : So, why don't I start Adam and then I'll turn it over to you. Here's the good news. Each of those managers had their own -- in most cases, it was really institutional. And so they have institutional sales teams, institutional relationships, and we've left those alone so why mess with success. But on the retail side, there has to be a leveraging of the broader Franklin Templeton. And so -- and this goes for our 18 specialized investment managers where you have institutional capability, you have what we call IPMs, institutional portfolio managers, who are really product specialists who sit with the investment team can be called in by the distribution team to come in and talk about the specific products. And they reside with the investment team. So, they're really an extension of it. And so we can call on those to help support any of the distribution capabilities. So, you could say that line is broadly divided by institutional and wealth channel. But there's always a little bit of gray in there. And so if there are relationships that one has on an institutional that they don't have, our institutional centralized team will bring in and make an introduction into any of our specialized investment managers. And it's imperative for us to make sure that there's good collaboration there. So, our goal is to continue to have the great momentum. As you can see with Lexington, the fact that they've increased from $34 billion to $42 billion pre-close that, obviously, they have a tremendous distribution team. But we also feel strongly that -- as I mentioned, that secondary private equity is ideal in the wealth channel. As far as product capability, one of the ways in which we think that the wealth channel is going to be able to access the alternatives is things like 401(k) plans where you have a managed account that has an allocation to alternatives. And so we have a centralized product team that is going in and thinking about where they can pull in the capabilities to present a great combined solution. And we expect our teams to work together to help build those really solution-oriented type of products. Adam do you want to add anything to that? Adam Benjamin : Sure. I think the one thing Jenny I would put in at the top is that hopefully it goes without being said, but the one place where we're not going to integrate anything is on the investment teams or the investment process, right? These terms are absolutely distinct. Jenny is right that really our distribution model in general is a general specialist model where the folks who sit at the center are responsible for knowing their clients better than anyone else and then bringing in the right specialists from the various specialized investment managers. On the outside, institutionally, we're actually adding specialists alternative salespeople to introduce the various alternative SIMs to the relevant gatekeepers in the institutional markets. We also see an uptake in the use of our salespeople outside of the US where some of the alternative firms don't have as significant of a presence. Again, it's really an opt-in model and we help each firm as they need it. On the wealth platforms, branding is an important consideration. And I think how we're tackling that at this point is that each of our alternative SIMs are going to retain their own branding, but the distribution effort will be under FT alternatives. So, there's really a single point of contact in the wealth channel, but the individual brands remain. That also really enables us to do some interesting things in terms of multi-affiliate products in that channel. The product development is going well. We're focused both on onetime raise products, as well as evergreen products. And then another area of ours that you know we're focused on is ESG and the inclusion of ESG into alternative products is something we've focused on as well, which we think will yield significant results. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. And just a simple reporting question. There's a pretty big gap for Lexington between fee-paying AUM and AUM. How are you going to report it? Are you reporting the fee paying, or are you going to report the total AUM and we'll just sort of get the gap to close the fee rate or...? Matt Nicholls : Yes. I mean, yes, just to be just so we're consistent with how we report other things we're going to report all of the AUM. We're going to be very transparent about the fee rates. I mean, if you take the full AUM, the effective fee rate is probably something like low 60s. If you include just the fee-based AUM, it's going to be in the mid-80s to low 80s, plus performance fees. So that's the way we will do it. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Really two. First, maybe just, can you update us on the wealth management channel? I know you've talked a bit about it in a place we wanted to do some more acquisitions. But it's up to $35 billion had inflows. Can you maybe dig a little deeper in some of the -- your initiatives there on continuing to drive that kind of very sticky growth business? And then I'll have a follow-up on fintech. Jenny Johnson : Yes. So, it's -- we really like that business. We have said that we -- it's a strategic priority for us to grow it. As you mentioned, it had six consecutive quarters of positive net flows. It's one of those businesses. I think the average relationship is something like 16 years. It's a great sticky business, so we like it. We had done the two acquisitions and we're really pleased because the AUM of those specific entities is up like at 29%. So, we're continuing to look for more opportunities. Those opportunities will have to be additive, either geographically or bring some sort of capability and we're always looking. It is an area that you've seen private actually be buying up and consolidating. So, we don't want to chase assets. We usually like somebody who's looking for a long-term home to add capability to their -- to what they can offer to clients by having the broader fiduciary trust. And this is one of those businesses -- it's on the [indiscernible] it's probably close to 80 years now. And they really understand multigenerational wealth, which means education around errors and things. And so, it's the right home for people who have that type of client. Robert Lee : Okay. Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned in the press release for example and I know it's been, I think an interest of yours for many years is financial technology and talk about history of innovation and embracing it. But can you maybe -- I don't know if there's specific examples that you could call out or point to besides maybe the Embark transaction that maybe beneath the surface you feel like have been helped you differentiate on distribution or performance front, or maybe they're just early investments, but you're particularly excited about the potential to help accelerate growth over the next several years? Jenny Johnson : Yeah. So I'll talk about -- actually at a wealth adviser fintech conference as we speak. The AdvisorEngine, which we acquired which has juncture, which is the CRM system, it's for RIAs and helps them build their business. It's a small acquisition but it's a great way to speak to -- I think there's something like 12,000 users on the CRM system. So it just gives us another way to talk to that channel. Go, which was developed in-house is our gold optimization engine. As that gets integrated, it's a cloud-based financial planning platform, it gets integrated with other platforms. It helps us to sell our models and deliver our models through those and clients could choose open architecture. They can choose our proprietary models. So any of these -- the adviser -- when it became fee-based, the client values the investment as a piece of it but they also expect the adviser to do a lot more things like tax efficiency, which is of course why Canvas is so significant. So financial planning, tax efficiency, education it really -- the fee-based adviser is now expected to deliver what the ultra-high net worth channel used to just deliver to clients even including estate planning and trust planning. So anything that we can do that helps that adviser build their business and create loyalty is how we think of that fintech ecosystem. So as I mentioned AdvisorEngine I think that the juncture platform has advisers and about $600 billion in assets, it just allows us to communicate and to share our capabilities. It's obviously their discretion. And so it helps us just build deeper relationships. Adam Spector : Jenny, I would also add that it really helps us talk to a wider group of people at an investment advisory firm. Instead of just talking to people who are in the CIO organization, you're now talking to the business management group and you're talking about how they want to run their business and you're talking to them about how to help grow their business, which in the end helps position you better when you're actually trying to sell an investment product. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you so much for the added color. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir. Michael Cyprys : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the SMA front, I was hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit more on some of the initiatives there. I think you mentioned that the Franklin income strategy you're now offering that in SMA. Maybe you could talk a little bit about, how you navigated some of the challenges and complexity of offering such a strategy like that in SMA? And how you're thinking about offering other additional strategies in the SMA wrapper? Adam Spector : Yeah. The complexities largely come from a technological and operational standpoint. And that's where Legg Mason had a real lead on the industry, the number one provider of model-based SMAs, really strong technology and operational platform that we are now onboarding legacy Franklin strategies on to, which is accelerating their growth. So if you take a look recently of what we've been where we've been flattish in SMAs, it's really because we've seen some outflows on the legacy side with groups like Western and ClearBridge, but strong inflows onto newer SIMs that we've onboarded onto the platform like Martin Currie, Franklin Templeton, Fixed Income the Canvas platform. So again, we see diversification paying off well in the SMA space. We think that the other way that this could really go is adoption outside of the United States where we have some interest in some of our distribution partners to grow SMAs there as well. Michael Cyprys : Great. And just a follow-up question for Matt. With the $6 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, maybe you could just help flesh out how much which you think is truly excess here that you're sitting with today? I think you had called out around $4 billion after regulatory capital and product development. Is that the right number we should be thinking about, that's truly excess or maybe you can help bridge the remaining gap there? Matt Nicholls : Yeah. I mean I think we would define pure excess as being a lot lower than that. You know how conservative we are Mike, so I think we put it around $1 billion. But as I've mentioned beforehand, if you're talking about M&A, for example, these transactions are structured in a way that is sensible in this market in particular, the capability to be able to do larger things with in a structured way so you need less upfront is something that means that that amount of excess cash, let's say, can be stretched to create a much larger opportunity if there is one out there for us. Michael Cyprys : Got it. And any help on bridging from the $4 billion down to the $1 billion that you referenced? Matt Nicholls : Well, we have -- there's a little bit of regulatory capital in there a few hundred million dollars. I think we put that on the chart. Then we have a -- we call it a supplemental liquidity provision internally where we like to have several months of operating expenses in the form of cash on our balance sheet. So that's the second thing. The third thing is we just spent $1 billion. We put that in the footnote in the commentary just to make sure this was clear that the cash and investments are as at 3/31 but we spent $1 billion of cash on the upfront consideration for Lexington. And that bridges the gap really, yes. And then, you got the $1 billion surplus that we just talked about. Michael Cyprys : Great, thanks so much. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Dan Fannon from Jeffries. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on, I guess that topic and your appetite here for M&A, given obviously you just closed on a large deal, and you've been acquisitive for some time. So as you think about this backdrop, is there certain property -- you've obviously been linked also in some of the news more recently with other larger properties. So can you talk about your appetite for larger M&A in the short-term? And longer term, where those kind of product gaps, I think are mostly in alts, but are you looking also in other kind of more traditional areas that you could also round out your product offering? Jenny Johnson : So, I would say, we haven't changed -- listen, any time there is -- we've obviously just done a big deal and the markets are choppy, so the bar gets raised, but we're always running the business for the long-term. So that's first. With respect to product gaps, I would say that in the alternative space, we actually feel really good about the breadth of capabilities that we have. Infrastructure is probably the one hole that's broadly left and then, it's more about geographic. If the Clarinet, for example, may not have a lot in Asia, so it's always hard to sell a real estate manager if there isn't some local product or Benefits Street safe thing more US-focused, so if there were capabilities. But bar is very high for us now. We've also said wealth management is important for us. And I would say, from traditional problem \u2013 I'm trying to think, but the only area would be if there was an ETF manager that made sense for us that could be an interesting sort of traditional. We have so far gone with the organic growth on that and really like the capabilities we have, but if there was the right opportunity maybe that would make sense for us. So till then, of course obviously wealth management. Matt Nicholls : Yeah. And there's some specialists in the alternative asset area, where we do have a couple of gaps and we've talked about those. I mean, I think just at a high level, it's worthwhile making the point that from zero pretty much zero three years ago, or so we about 15% of our AUM is now in alt. So I think that probably translates into something like 18-or-so-percent of revenue and probably more like 20% plus in operating income. And our objective overall is to Jenny mentioned earlier that half of revenues are going to eventually come from alts in some form or other private markets to broadly defined. And we intend to continue to increase that percentage contribution from alternative assets. Dan Fannon : Got it. And then a follow-up on flows and just the institutional backlog. First off, if you could maybe talk about the makeup of that historically? When like Mason disclosed it, it was a lot of Western and I do want to follow-up on Western as well and talk about, if you could give us the numbers of kind of the makeup of what would be the core and core plus AUM, because those numbers are pretty stark in terms of the performance. And if I remember correctly, I think most of that is institutional. So in terms of the potential for redemptions as you think about that book maybe in the context of the institutional backlog as a whole for the firm and then kind of looking at the Western potential risk of some of the institutional AUM kind of some context around kind of the more near-term dynamics and conversations with clients and flow trends. Adam Spector : Sure. First of all, have we had challenges in core and core plus? Absolutely. But they're still very, very significant asset gatherers and among our top funds for gross sales. So while the net hasn't been strong, we still see a real commitment of clients there. And I think that, shows in the funding pipeline, where we still have a significant chunk of Western product in there. But if you take a look at that, and we don't really break it down by SIM, but I don't believe there's any one SIM that accounts for more than 25% of that funding pipeline. So again, as we continue to diversify our business, we're seeing diversification on the wealth front, as well as on the institutional front. The other thing about Western is, they manage a lot more than core and core plus. And as sales have slowed down in those areas we've seen a pickup in some of the other areas. And again, Western is more active than some of their other funds. And you don't get to a point where you have 95% of your assets outperforming over the three year, without taking some risk in the shorter term. And right now that risk hasn't paid off. But I think the market understands well, the way that Western manages money, and it will pay off over time. As Jenny said, every time they've had a dip like this before, they've come roaring back. Dan Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks so much taking my question. Maybe two-part. Jenny, you mentioned that getting the ultra into the retail wealth management is sort of one or two of your key priorities. Can you maybe expand on what your top priority is? And then for Matt, I'm sorry to belabor the question here. Can you just come back and unpack the expense numbers a little bit more and pretty substantial improvement in efficiency so I appreciate revenues are down. How much of the incremental savings is coming from the legacy business versus maybe more synergized opportunity with Lexington? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Yes. So I mean, I would say our priorities one is to making sure that we have the right product capabilities for the future. And so that's why we keep our eye open on M&A opportunities; two, is making sure that we're able to distribute them in all the channels where appropriate. And so bringing that -- we recognize as I said not all flows are equal that alternatives accounted for 15% of AUM and 46% of revenues is a really important area of growth. So we've got to figure out how to get that done right. And then I think from a disruption, we think about making sure that right now that we're not just focused on what has to be done now but we're focused on looking around the corners. And so that's why we keep our eye on FinTech investments things we think blockchain could be very disruptive. So those are kind of the high-level strategic initiatives that we think about. And then it's about operating this business as effectively inefficiently as we can. There's fees only go one way in this business and so you have to be constantly pushing yourself to make sure you're as efficient as possible. We made the decision to outsource a lot of our back office and that was a recognition that the -- honestly the service providers had become more efficient than we could be. Initially, we were the largest global manager and there wasn't any service provider that could cover us completely. Now there is and so those are all ways to continue to reinvent the way we operate our company to make sure that we always have efficiencies to deal with the fee pressure as well as the capability to invest in new opportunities. Matt Nicholls : And in terms of the cost question -- expenses question Bill, there is zero -- I mean it might be a tiny amount but there are zero cost synergies associated with the Lexington transaction. It's all about revenue synergies there for us as it is by the way across all of the alternative asset firms that we -- or SIMs that we've acquired. There may be -- these things like workday financial and implementing that across the firm and modest expense savings around that but that doesn't really -- frankly it doesn't move the needle. So there are zero of the expense reductions I've referred to from the Lexington transactions or from legacy in response to the market dynamics. Jenny Johnson : Actually, I just want to add one more on a priority because I genuinely believe -- bear if I missed it. Look sustainable finance is here to stay and we made the hire of \u2013 sense so that we can have a voice at the top of the table. We think ESG is probably the wrong term. It's really about long-term impact the companies as well as to the community and environment. And you look at Europe where ESG, we recognized with the current conflict and prices of oil that people may change their priorities of how they think about it. But the reality is in our own world we see 40% of the pipeline coming from really Article 8 and 9 type products and we think that's here to stay. So making sure that we're on product development. And as Adam mentioned, including in the alternative space, making sure that we have top sustainable finance type of products is really important to us. Bill Katz : Thank you, again. Matt Nicholls : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call over back to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO, for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Well, once, again, I would just like to really thank our employees for their hard work and remaining focused on our clients and each other. And particularly this time. This has been a quarter of really massive outreach to clients. And thank you all for participating in this call and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you, presenters. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

As a reminder this conference is being recorded. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's third fiscal quarter results. Matthew Nicholls, our CFO and COO and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution are on the call with me. Since January, macro economic and geopolitical factors have contributed to global financial markets experiencing a period of volatility not witnessed in decades with substantial drawdowns of both equities and fixed income markets. These declines have challenged investor sentiment and industry flows, particularly in fixed income. Assets under management and flows were impacted by these industry wide pressures. We continue to benefit from a diversified mix of assets. As investors look to reposition their portfolios, we've seen interest in our alternatives and multi-asset strategies, which both experienced strong net inflows during the quarter. In addition, notwithstanding flow pressures in fixed income, investor interest remains robust across the asset class. Over the past few years, we've been very deliberate in transforming our company by expanding our investment capabilities, and deepening our presence in key markets and channels. This diversification combined with our financial flexibility serves us well across market cycles, and is creating broader sources of revenue, positioning our company for future success. This quarter, we continue to make progress building our alternative asset business, which is less correlated to public markets, and a source of increasing client demand. We now have specialist investment managers that represent a meaningful portion of the key alternative categories. On April 1, we closed the acquisition for Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity, where current markets create further interesting opportunities. At the end of May, we announced the acquisition of Alcentra, and we're pleased to welcome the Alcentra team to Franklin Templeton. This acquisition was an opportunity for us to enter the European alternative credit sector at meaningful scale and globalize our current U.S. alternative credit business Benefit Street Partners as one of the largest European credit and private debt managers, Alcentra has approximately $38 billion in AUM, with global expertise across a broad array of credit strategies. Given the current challenging market conditions, we are pleased to have carefully structured the transaction to help mitigate risks. Alcentra has a strong team that will benefit from the scale, stability and cultural alignment of being part of a combined alternative credit specialist investment manager led by Benefit Street Partners long tenured and experienced senior management team. Pro forma for Alcentra's AUM, our alternative credit AUM doubles to approximately $77 billion and our aggregate alternative AUM increases to over $260 billion representing 19% of our AUM and an even higher percentage of our adjusted revenues. As mentioned this quarter's market environment challenged industry flows. And while we continue to benefit from a diversified mix of assets, we had third quarter long-term net outflows of $19.8 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, long-term net outflows were $7.4 billion. This quarter's continued market dislocation, rising rate environment, and the need for inflation hedging has heightened investor interest in alternatives. Our net inflows increased to $2.1 billion this quarter, and included outflows in certain liquid alternative strategies. Our three largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, and Lexington Partners each had net inflows with a combined total of $4 billion. Fundraising momentum in this area continues. Our multi-asset net inflows were $1.6 billion, which represented the fourth consecutive positive quarter for the asset class. In this broad market sell off environment where investors are focused on income generating strategies, we benefited from having strong income funds managed for yield with notable investment track records and customization strategies. The first half of 2022 saw the worst fixed income net outflows for the U.S. mutual fund industry since 2000 with six consecutive months of net outflows. While current interest in the asset class continues to be strong, and our fixed income inflows increased by 6% from the prior quarter, net outflows were $14.3 billion primarily due to certain U.S. taxable and muni strategies. We benefited from having a broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies, including net flows into taxable U.S. income, multisector bond, corporate and enhanced liquidity strategies. Equity net outflows were $9.2 billion. This quarter the risk off environment impacted investor sentiment on certain growth strategies, which were partially offset by positive net flows into infrastructure, emerging markets and sector specific equity strategies. Consistent with what we've learned throughout our 75 year history, we've been front and center with our clients to help them navigate this period of high market volatility, rising rates and inflation and fears of recession. In this period of uncertainty, the importance of thought leadership and active engagement have increased. Clients are looking to us to provide them with investment solutions focused on income, inflation hedged alternative and customization strategies, as they look to rebalance their portfolios and reallocate risk across a variety of asset classes. Last year, we shifted through regionally focused sales model to meet the varying demands of our global business, shifting decision making and resources closer to our clients. This quarter, we saw the benefits of geographical diversification outside the U.S. with improving net sales trends in EMEA and positive net flows in the Americas. Net flows for non-U.S. regions improved by 79% fiscal year-to-date from the year-ago period. Touching briefly on our financial results, which reflect the acquisition of Lexington Partners, adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion relatively flat from the prior quarter and a decrease of 3% from the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted effective fee rate increased to 39.5 basis points, compared to 38.5 basis points in the prior quarter. Expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter and a 1% improvement from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income was $567 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% from the prior quarter, and a decline of 6% from the prior-year quarter. Our balance sheet position remains strong with total cash investments in excess of $6 billion after upfront cash consideration of almost $1 billion was paid for the acquisition of Lexington. Let me wrap up by saying that over the past several years, we've significantly diversified the firm to serve more clients across a broader range of investment strategies with deep expertise and specialization in both public and private markets through more vehicles across geographies. Although the current market landscape presents challenges for the investment industry, and our firm within it, we are proud of the progress that we have made to date to help our clients in both good and challenging market conditions. Finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated employees whose hard work and commitment to help people all over the world achieve the most important financial milestones of their lives. Now let's turn it over to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Thank you very much. So Jenny, I enjoyed the comps in prepared remarks on the wealth management alternatives and everything that you're doing on the education front. So I'm curious from a product standpoint, how you're thinking about just making drawdown funds available or putting retail-specific products in motion, specifically semi-liquid products like order and liquidity? Because we've seen some hiccups lately as markets pull back and seeing gross sales free up, so I'm just curious how you're thinking about the products that you're bringing into that channel? Jenny Johnson : Yes. No, thanks. I mean -- and Glenn, you know this well. Like the opportunity, obviously, in the wealth channel is tremendous, but it's really complicated, right? And we're learning that through the process of -- the first battle is to be able to get to the gatekeepers, and you're finding that there's a massive amount of education that you have to do. It's complicated to sign up clients, and so we've made investments in companies like Case. We now have our -- several of our products on both iCapital and Case. And then the education piece is a big deal, and so we're actually working with Case through our FT Academy to actually do education and the alternatives. We have things like the BSP, BDC. CP Reef is actually getting interesting traction in the RIA channel. You have to get some size before the wirehouses will put you on their platform even if you pass their due diligence, and so it's really important that you have the relationships in the RIA channel. You may recall small acquisition that we did in the private credit space. So they'd actually -- Benefit Street Partners purchased it, but it was -- they had experience in REIT with the RIAs. So there's a lot of fronts where you have to get it right to actually get the traction. But we feel like our opportunity zone fund, which is on quite a few of the big wirehouses, CP Reef, the BDCs, we even have -- on our venture fund, have managed to get that on some of the private banks. So those are the types of products. It's really more of kind of the interval fund, for fund. Adam, do you have anything you want to add on? Adam Spector : Yes. Glenn, I just might add that when we talk about the distribution of alternatives to the wealth platform, yes, that's a broad strategic effort, but each platform is a little bit different. And so I think one of the things we've been able to do well over the last few quarters is to engage with kind of the head gatekeepers of each platform to say what type of a strategy is really best for you. Some want perpetual, some want other things, some want a product where there's going to be a broad consortium of banks participating the deal, others want something that's more bespoke for their platform. So we've really been able to be a little more specific about what we're offering on each platform, and I think that will pay significant benefit. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. Maybe just one quick follow-up. You know that there were fixed income flows since 2000. It is what it is, the market was a bit nuts. Now that we've gotten some reprieve in terms of the rate move, the spread move as they've settled in, could we hope and should we expect that fixed income, especially U.S. taxable, settle in with those conditions? Jenny Johnson : Well, interesting -- sorry. I'll start and then, Adam, you can fill in. I mean, you're saying some of our biggest growth flows are still into fixed income. So while I think there's been redemptions, and obviously, much heavier redemptions on the retail channel than on the institutional channel, we still see strong flows into asset class. And then I would just say one thing that I'm not sure is fully appreciated, we cover the spectrum on views on -- in the fixed income market. So when you look at Brandywine, the Franklin fixed income and Western, we actually -- their alpha generation only correlates 0.15x, right? So there's always something performing in that category. And what you see is whether it's insurance companies or others, there is a need for fixed income types of investments and returns in income generating. And frankly, that may be in the private markets as well as the public markets, but there's definitely demand there. Adam, do you have anything to add? Adam Spector : I would add, Jenny, that -- yes, I would add that -- a few things. One, the asset class is just more attractive flat out with higher yields, and it's less risky with lower degradation, so I think there's just a better data to be had in the fixed income. The other thing we've seen that is on the pension side, as we see folks a little better funded at this point, looking to the eye type strategies, which we're now offering, it's another area where you might see some growth in fixed income allocation. Glenn Schorr : That definitely makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Michael Cho : This is Michael Cho. I'm in for Ken today. I wanted to shift gears a little bit and ask a little bit about the recent launch of the blockchain-based money market fund. I realize it's been in the press for a little while now, but some time has passed. I'm just curious, kind of a few things. One, I mean, what are kind of your objectives of launching a fund on the blockchain? And then two, I think I saw on the seller chain, but -- but kind of what were your considerations when you pick that one versus Ethereum or versus a private chain? And then query, like, again, sometimes has passed. Any lessons learned you like to share so far? Jenny Johnson : Sure. So let me get -- one, we picked Stellar at the time because Ethereum was something called proof-of-work and Stellar was proof of stake. And the difference as you hear on the criticism of Bitcoin is all about how energy -- what an energy drain it is, and that's because its concept is you have to solve algorithms to be able to post on the chain, and so that's a big energy drain. Whereas we knew that that was going to become more of an issue. Ethereum is trying to shift to proof of stake. And so we ended up -- Stellar was designed as proof of stake, and so we selected that. We decided to build this money market fund, honestly, because we think there will be a convergence. Over time, these types of tokenized assets will become -- I think they'll become securities and they'll be regulated. Now there's other countries that are further ahead probably than the U.S. in this, and -- but I think that there's going to be a convergence, so we wanted to make sure that we understood it and we were able to get in front of the wave. We think ultimately, it will drive down cost in this environment, so we'll be able to deliver the same kind of quality investment products at a lower cost when you build these types of things on the chain. And starting out with the money market fund just made a lot of sense. Honestly, we looked at and we still think it, and you've already -- now you're starting to see it, that some of the products that were deemed \"stable coins\" that we're yielding 7% and 8%. Anybody who has an investment background knew that there was no way there could be a stable coin. And so we just felt like it made sense for us to to come out with a money market fund. And we worked with the SEC, I mean, literally throughout it. As we both became educated on it, it took a while, and we are an approved 40x money market fund. Where it goes, well, the market's going to evolve as people get more comfortable with this asset class or -- it's not even an asset class, with the technology where they can hold their tokens in a secure wallet, which is complicated in itself. And right now, it's a lot of people kind of playing around that space, but it will become more institutionalized. And we can take all of these learnings. What we built on the Stellar system can launch other 40x funds. So again, it was just really a way to make sure that we're understanding disruption as it comes to our industry, and that we're riding the wave forward. Michael Cho : Okay, great. That is wonderful, thanks Jenny. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, hi. Good morning everyone. This is actually Rick on for Dan. So I wanted to tack on to the fixed income discussion from earlier. So just looking at the data that we have available to us, and you guys living this business well, clear that a sizable chunk of the deterioration you guys are seeing in outflows are coming from retail. But just like thinking about the large institutional base and nature of the Western franchise, could you maybe speak on trends and conversations you're having with that client base and the platform more specifically? Jenny Johnson : Yes. I mean, a couple of things. First of all, in the past 10 years, Western has absolutely outperformed in nine of the 10 years. And in the 1 year, they underperformed 2018. They crushed it in 2019 and made up for any underperformance, so I always like to say be careful betting against the Western. And as a matter of fact, while it's a little early to tell, my CFO constantly reminds me that quarter-to-date Western is in their top decile. So they're proving out that maybe their positioning could be right. So -- but as I said, from here managing the business, we're happy that we have really diversified perspectives on end products in the fixed income space with low correlation. Now, institutional investors, Western has a lot of conversations with them. They understand Western. As a matter of fact, Morningstar just maintained their Gold rating and talked about how they have high conviction on the investment team and that they are an excellent investment team. And so I think we're continue to be very optimistic. I think people slow down for now, but it wouldn't be surprised. And yet, I believe the Core, Core Plus is our top selling from a gross sales fund. So there's obviously still a lot of money going in there. Adam Spector : Yes. And if you look at -- Unidentified Analyst : Depreciating sales were -- Adam Spector : Yes, we're up quarter-over-quarter. Remember that Core and Core Plus are about 1/3 of Western's total AUM. They have a lot of other things that are doing exceedingly well. And on top of that, even within the Core and Core Plus plan, we've got a very significant institutional pipeline. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Alexander Blostein : Maybe we could start with some of the dynamics and some of the numbers around the alt products for you guys. Obviously, with Lexington coming in, there's a couple of moving pieces. So I was hoping maybe just to get a reset on what the fee paying AUM is for the old bucket? I think you guys gave us total AUM, but I was hoping to get the fee paying AUM, the management fees that are being generated by Lexington, not as it's fully in the run rate as well as the kind of the total gold bucket. And then on Lexington specifically, any updates you could provide us with from a fundraising perspective? I think they're in the market with Fund X. How that's going, what the expectations are, when that fund AUM will start coming into the run rate? Matthew Nicholls : Do you want to start, Jenny, okay? Jenny Johnson : No, no, you go ahead. Matthew Nicholls : Okay. Alex, on the management fee incomes from -- on the management fee revenue from the alternative asset managers that we have, we'll likely aggregate something like, on an annualized basis, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. I think we've communicated that in the past, and that's consistent with what we said. That's about 50% up from the previous year. And that excludes performance fees, of course, as we've explained. So that's where we're at on the management fee revenues. Jenny Johnson : And I would say on the Lexington that they are on schedule despite the environment on their fundraising. So as -- Matthew Nicholls : And then -- and then if you're looking for the -- for an idea of what the overall alternative asset business is relative to the size of our franchise, if we pro forma the business for Alcentra, for instance, where about 19% of our alternative management would be in the alternative asset space, 21% of revenue roughly in, probably up to something like 1/4 of our operating income will be from Alternative Assets as a whole. Alexander Blostein : Got it, all right. I will hop back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please proceed. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning guys. There have been a lot of questions out there about the quality of the Alcentra business, given what looks like fairly stagnant AUM over the last few years, obviously, some high-profile employee losses. I understand it looks like you've got a very good price relative to what they're hoping to get in and obviously, put a lot of protections into that price. But could you flesh out a bit how you see the process of running the ship there and getting back up to the level of growth we expect from a private credit manager? Jenny Johnson : Yes. Well, first, I mean, the turnover that happened obviously happened all before the deal was announced. It was really at the senior level, and I think that the area of concern was the direct lending. And the rest of the business has been growing very well and has had very good performance. And so I think it's important to block the noise around that, but I think that it's important to understand that was just at a very senior level, which is why there's an opportunity with the fact that we can roll it in with Benefit Street Partners that already has a good senior leadership team. And then one of the things that I think we understand really well and why we've been successful in acquisitions is we understand that you're buying an investment team and their investment process, and so it's important that you have retention. And so we've built in retention to ensure that we minimize any kind of -- the future, anybody leaving in the future. I think that what's really exciting is that we are -- our distribution in Europe has continued to improve. And now you take a product like this that we think that -- our distribution is incredibly excited about having private credit to be able to sell. And so being able to bring these 2 things together, we are very, very optimistic. So I don't know, Adam, anything else you want to add? Adam Spector : Yes. I would just say that Alcentra brings two things that, one, is a product capability that's very European-specific in addition to other products, but that really helps us out with our alternative franchise and a real distribution capability as well. Both of those things are added. Matthew Nicholls : I'll just end by saying, Patrick, that as you know, we study M&A pretty hard in the asset management arena, including both traditional and alternative assets. And we felt that globalizing, as Jenny just mentioned, globalizing our alternative credit capabilities by adding Europe is very important given the growth potential in -- across that region, frankly, both the U.K. and Europe. And we concluded, while we like to grow things organically ourselves, it's our #1 priority is always to grow organically where we can. There are some things that just take too long to become a leader. Too long to grow, too long to be relevant, frankly. And in our opinion, it would have taken us perhaps a decade to create what Alcentra has become, just like it's taken 15 years to become what Benefit Street Partners has become. And we just concluded that this was the best way to become a true global leader in alternative credit. So that's why we did what we did. And to your point on price, the price is driven a little bit around some of the uncertainty in the overall market. But also it's just a function of how M&A can be structured, and we've done that very carefully. And we've got in the growth of the business, and we expect there to be growth. As Jenny mentioned, there are multiple sectors, multiple strategies at Alcentra, and most of them have grown quite nicely, and we expect that to continue post-close. Jenny Johnson : Just to add, during the due diligence process, as you can imagine, we checked on the reputation of the firm with the consultants and institutions, and we're very comfortable with that. We think they still despite some of the headline stories around turnover have excellent reputation in the market. Patrick Davitt : Great, helpful. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. Would you be willing to give the total AUM in kind of this core flagship strategies at Western? There's so much of institutional that we can't see. I don't think we've got an update on that in a while. Jenny Johnson : The Core Plus strategy or Core and Core Plus strategy? Patrick Davitt : Core and Core Plus. Matthew Nicholls : Core and Core Plus together is about $150 billion approximately at West. Patrick Davitt : Sure, great. Matthew Nicholls : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Stephanie Ma of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Stephanie Ma : This is Stephanie on for Mike Cyprys. My first question is on expense and performance fee outlook. So hoping you can just give us an update or mark-to-market on expenses given lower AUM levels? And then performance fees, that continues to be much stronger than you had guided. So any color on that outlook would be helpful as well. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So on overall expenses, I think in the last call in the last quarter, we guided to $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion of adjusted operating expenses for the full fiscal year ended 9/30. The update to that I would say is that we expect to be on the lower end of that. So instead of just saying $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, we expect to be closer to $3.9 billion and then to $3.95 billion. And remember, that includes Lexington. So we -- a couple of quarters ago, I think I explained that we were in the $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion excluding performance fees and excluding Lexington. Last quarter, we said $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion excluding performance fees, including Lexington. This quarter, we're saying $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion excluding performance fees, including Lexington and would be on the lower end, we believe, all else remaining equal for the year. In terms of specifics around that, I think last quarter, I guided to the different line items and we'd expect those to be approximately the same. So G&A to be approximately $140 million, occupancy around $57 million and IS&T to be around $125 million, and all those things are obviously inclusive of Lexington partners. And then our comp ratio, we've guided to around 45% for the year, and we expect that to also be at 45% for the year. In terms of performance fees, we don't guide on performance fees, frankly. I mean, the way I've communicated this in previous calls is to say that we think for modeling purposes, $30 million to $40 million is reasonable. Obviously, we acknowledge the fact that we've been higher than that for a few quarters now. But again, it's very hard to calculate where our performance fees are going to be. But all I'd say is that obviously, the reason why performance fees have gone up is because we're performing well in a number of our asset classes, both across real estate and credit. And other areas, frankly, we've crossed about 9 of our specialist investment management companies, although it's concentrated AB&3. It's because we're just getting larger in alternative assets that the potential to earn more performance fees is going up as we continue to increase our alternative asset business. But I'm sticking with -- Stephanie Ma : That's very helpful. If I can just place my follow-up in here. We noticed a reference to the China JV of $12 billion of AUM. So hoping you can expand on some of the initiatives there? And are there any plans to raise your ownership? And then what sort of growth are you seeing in that region? Jenny Johnson : So I believe that we have said that we would like to extend our ownership in there now that the regulations have changed, and so we're in discussions to do that. We also have a wholly-owned fee, which would give us other optionality if that -- we were not able to buy 100%. Look, China is a massive, important market. We were early as far as firms, asset managers who did joint venture partners. We have unbelievably excellent performance, have had really stable investment teams there. We hired Dr. Ben Mang, who is our Chairman of Asia-Pacific and is well connected. And we -- it has been a profitable business for us. We think it can be much more meaningful as far as its contributions over the long run. Stephanie Ma : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Alexander Blostein : Hey, thanks for follow-up. A couple of quick ones here. So I guess just go back to performance fee discussion for a second. Matt, given the fact that it's gotten a bigger portion of the overall business model, maybe you can frame to us sort of the sources of performance fees that you saw this quarter and any kind of ideas on performance fee accruals that could be realized over time as investments kind of crystallize? Or just to kind of get a better sense of what that -- the bucket of potential performance fees are going to look like going forward? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean, a good portion of the increased performance fees quarter-over-quarter has been from our real estate franchise, Clarion Partners, where the performance has been outstanding. So I'd say a good 60% of it or something like that and then probably a higher percentage of the increasing performance fees that we've had is, frankly, just from performance thresholds being met and quarterly realizations of that performance has made the performance fees actions. So that's the -- that is the primary source of the increase in performance fees. But I wouldn't want to understate the performance of our credit business also that has led to performance fees, performance fee increases over the last two or three quarters, in particular. The -- it's really a combination of realizations, quarterly performance thresholds and annual performance fee thresholds. Maybe it's helpful to say that we think that our performance fees will probably peak at the calendar year-end, so that would be the end of our first quarter. And then perhaps another useful point is out about $127 million this quarter, approximately 70% of it is specifically quarterly performance fees. So you might get to argue that something between $60 million, $70 million could if we have exactly the same performance next quarter or this quarter. Again, I'm not guiding you this way for modeling purpose. I've already explained how I'd look at that. But you could argue that we could at least get up to $60 million, $70 million if we were to repeat that. Alexander Blostein : Yes. Okay. I got you. That's helpful. And then another quick one for me just around the balance sheet. So lots of moving pieces. Obviously, election payment came out. You guys have contingencies coming up as well. How are you thinking about sort of the discretionary cash balance today? So if you were to think about maybe both cash and investments, and you would say, okay, how much of that is sort of truly available for corporate purposes or whatever else? And how much do you guys think you're going to need to use towards future GP co-investment or GP balance sheet commitments, given the fact that your liquids are getting bigger over the next couple of years here? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So firstly, out of our roughly $2.6 billion of investments, let's say half of that is very liquid, highly liquid, like well over $1 billion of it is highly liquid. But it's been important to see new funds in order to accelerate access to distribution opportunities. I think we've explained that we've got a very good multiple on that feeding in terms of the AUM that's been created from it. So that's sort of number one. So we wouldn't want to liquidate that, but we can recirculate that. We've got much more disciplined, but not just letting seed capital sit in funds for like 5 years. So every year, we're able to circulate several hundred million dollars, I would say, out of the $2.6 million. And a portion of that recirculation, Alex, is going into more of the alternative asset area. We probably have $800 million or something like that now invested across the alternative asset businesses that we have, which is more longer term in investments versus the rest. It's more short-term seed capital. So number one, we're getting better circulating it even without increasing the $2.6 million. But number two, every year, we are earmarking a meaningful amount of income, and our cash if we need to, to continue to invest in GP level alternative asset opportunities. I should say that we -- when we provide that commitment, we also allow our senior employees at both the Alternative Asset business and across Franklin to invest, and we're getting so much interest from employees to invest in these areas that the actual commitment of Franklin and making off the balance sheet is reducing versus increasing. But again, if we -- we don't have that interest because of general market condition or something. Franklin is there, and we could expect that to increase meaningfully. In terms of the amount of cash that we think we have, so let's say, excess cash or cash available to do further investing, and then including M&A, put that in excess of $1 billion. But obviously, in this current market conditions, we are very cautious, very disciplined. And we think having cash on hand for opportunistic situations is going to be a competitive advantage of ours. So that's how we look at cash. We felt that we're in a good position with the around $6 billion or more of cash and investments. Disciplined with circulating the investments, adding to it carefully each year. And with the cash piece, you mentioned upcoming acquisition-related things, you're right. That's why we're concerted with it because we do have $1.6 billion of acquisition-related payments over the next four years. We also have $1.4 billion of debt over the next five years coming due, which we can reason adds, but we also like to be able to delever where it's -- when debt is getting more expensive. So that's how we look at that. Alexander Blostein : Awesome, thanks a lot. I will leave there. Matthew Nicholls : Sure, thanks Alex. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please proceed. Adam Beatty : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan this morning. Kind of a two-parter a multi-parter on alts distribution. In particular, we're wondering about some of the nuances of alts distribution in the European market, particularly for European retail and what you're seeing there? And then in kind of a separate angle, just wanted to get your thoughts on how much sort of product and distribution crops over you're expecting between Alcentra and BSP? Jenny Johnson : So I think -- I'm not sure I know sort of the detailed nuances other than there's a couple of just trends that are relevant everywhere for all, right? And we've talked about it before where you're just seeing companies waiting longer to go public. You're seeing less opportunities on equities to invest in, that universe has shrunk. I think banks -- Basel III capital requirements have made it such that banks are much more careful with who they're choosing to lend to, which has created this proliferation of private credit. I think that is a direct response to some of the capital changes that have happened in the banking industry. And so you see meaningful excess returns in the private markets. And there is such an opportunity to naturally bring that to the wealth channel. The problem is it's a bit like running with scissors where you've got this illiquid assets to often people who require it. And so creating those types of vehicles is important and being really aware about how you do that. And so that's the type of thing our product development team is working on. And then same as in the U.S., it requires just a massive amount of education plus the complexity of things like signing up for these. And so big opportunity there, but it is -- it's a lot of blocking and tackling that happens before you really start to see the traction. I think in the U.S., we are finally starting. I mean, we've been talking about this for 2 years. It's a core priority, and we're only now starting to finally see that traction. We think it's going to be similar -- again, we all say Europe, but the reality is every country is different. You might have EU regulations, but then they get interpreted. And so it's definitely even more complicated to bring the customized products to those markets. Adam, anything you want to add to that? Adam Spector : Yes. I would add that if you think about all of the transactions that Franklin Templeton has done, one of the real hallmarks of them has been a lack of overlap in product. As you get larger, that gets harder and harder to have 0 overlap. But in general, we feel really, really good about the transactions we're doing and how little overlap there is across the product set. I think there's also a real advantage of having a regional specific alternatives manager, which means that those products will be even more geared towards the local market. Two other comments I would add is that within Europe, there's really two different pieces of the -- of bringing alternatives to the wealth channel. One is really at the ultra-high net worth level, and the other is more at the mass affluent level. We want to make sure we address both. And then finally, I would say, sustainability continues to be a big trend around the world, but especially in Europe. So in Europe, to the extent that you can add sustainability to your alternatives in the wealth channels, that's where I think the real growth will be. Jenny Johnson : And to answer your question about BSP versus Alcentra, very little overlap there. Adam Beatty : Yes, and so are you planning to sort of be able to cross distribute that, similar to what you've done with Legg Mason legacy? Matthew Nicholls : I mean, yes -- sorry, there's a little overlap, Adam. But the opportunity to work together, whether it's on transactions, flow with -- from a distribution perspective, helping raise capital together. I mean, there's really meaningful opportunities on a global scale with the two together. And obviously, the relationships across two are also complementary, so we think there could be some really interesting opportunities there as they work together. Adam Beatty : That's perfect, thank you very much. That is all, sorry go ahead. Okay. Jenny Johnson : But just saying, BSP was very, very U.S.-focused, right? And so -- and Alcentra had very little footprint in the U.S. A little bit, I think, on CLOs and things. And so Europeans tend to like to buy -- everybody loves to cheer for their home team, so Europeans tend to like to buy European private credit as opposed it's much harder if you can even do it to sell U.S. private credit into Europe. . And so there can be global products. You can have some of the deals worked on together from a team, some of the research can be shared. But the good news is it was really hard for BSP to sell their products into Europe, and now we have excellent private credit to sell into Europe and even Asia. Adam Beatty : Very interesting. No, no. Thank you so much, Jenny. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Great. Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating in the call today. And once again, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and remaining focused on our clients, particularly in this type of market environment and also for supporting each other. We look forward to speaking to you guys again next quarter, and I'd just say enjoy the rest of your summer and stay healthy. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Candy, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations of Franklin Resources, you may now begin.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results. As usual, Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also joining me on the call. This month, we officially celebrate our 75th anniversary as a company. Our firm was founded on the values of advice, active investment management and helping people achieve the most important financial milestones of their lives. Since 1947, we have transformed from modest beginnings into one of the world's largest investment managers. And today, we partner with millions of clients in more than 155 countries. Although much has changed in 75 years, we are proud to say we have a history of innovation, and we have always maintained our commitment to evolve our organization to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders around the globe. Consistent with this, I'm pleased to say that we made good progress in fiscal 2022 on executing our long-term plan and further diversifying our business by expanding our investment capabilities and deepening our presence in key markets and channels. Since January, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty have resulted in significant volatility and correlated declines in both global equity and fixed income markets. Our assets under management and flows were impacted by these unprecedented conditions and industry-wide pressures. However, as always, we have been actively engaging with our clients by providing insights and thought leadership to help them navigate the latest conditions, including drawing upon the expanded resources of our various specialist investment managers and the Franklin Templeton Institute. This fiscal year, notwithstanding flow pressures, investor interest continued in all asset classes. We benefited from having a diversified mix of assets and generated net inflows in the alternative and multi-asset categories and reduced net outflows in equities offset by increased outflows in fixed income and steep market declines. In terms of our progress, we are more diversified than at any point in our history across asset classes, client type, regions and investment vehicles. Starting with asset classes. We continue to thoughtfully expand our alternative investment capabilities, which are an increasing source of client demand and can offer superior returns. Just a few years ago, we managed about $15 billion in alternative assets. Pro forma for Alcentra, as of September 30, today, we managed $260 billion or approximately 20% of our AUM and alternatives, and these assets account for an even higher percentage of adjusted revenues. This makes Franklin Templeton one of the largest managers of alternative assets. Speaking of Alcentra, we were excited to announce today the completion of our acquisition ahead of schedule. Alcentra is one of the largest European credit and private debt managers. And with this closing, our alternative credit assets under management nearly doubled to $75 billion, and we expand our capabilities into Europe. We now have a meaningful portion of the key alternative categories, including secondary private equity with Lexington Partners, real estate with Clarion Partners, hedge funds with K2 Advisors, alternative credit with Benefit Street Partners and Alcentra and venture capital with Franklin Venture Partners. For the fiscal year, alternative net inflows were $6.3 billion, including outflows in liquid alternative strategies. Our three largest alternative managers, BSP, Clarion and Lexington each had positive net flows with a combined total of approximately $12 billion. There is tremendous opportunity in the democratization of private markets as individual investors are under allocated to the asset class, when compared to institutions. Over the past year, we have focused on product development and suitability, sales and marketing and client education in the distribution of alternatives in wealth management. On the product side, BSP recently launched its first multi-strategy interval fund. Additionally, Clarion Partners Real Estate Income Fund and Franklin BSP Capital Corporation, a private Business Development Corporation, were on-boarded on two alternative fintech platforms that offer direct access to financial advisers and individuals. Again, this is all part of our broader effort to enable more investors to benefit from diversification of private markets and other alternative strategies. In this regard, to complement institutional focused resources, within our specialist investment managers we have created a dedicated alternatives distribution team that covers wealth management channels. In addition to being diversified, within our alternative asset strategies, we also benefit from a broad range of fixed income, equity and multi-asset strategies. In the multi-asset category, our flagship Franklin Income Fund which has an approach that is adjustable to changing market conditions generated net flows of $4.8 billion in the year due to increased interest from investors in Asia and Europe. Turning to fixed income. We benefited from a broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies, including positive net flows into US income, intermediate and highly customized. Notwithstanding the pressure in growth equity in particular, equity net outflows improved by 61% from the prior year, with positive net flows across a diverse array of strategies, including infrastructure, sector, emerging markets, all cap Core and equity income. From a client perspective, less than three years ago, retail investors represented 74% of our asset mix. Today, our business is balanced with approximately 50% individuals and 50% institutions. Furthermore, we continue to expand our private wealth management business and Fiduciary Trust International generated its eighth quarter of consecutive positive long-term net flows. Our firm is also diversified by geography and our efforts to implement a regionally focused distribution model that has shifted decision-making and resources closer to our clients is yielding results. For example, we have seen an improvement in our non-US business, including a 70% reduction in long-term net outflows from the prior year. EMEA long-term net flows turned positive, and there was a significant decrease in long-term net outflows in our APAC region. Turning to diversification by investment vehicle. We continue to build on our strengths in delivering investment expertise through our clients' investment vehicles of choice. Similar to the industry at large, we are seeing strong demand for SMAs and ETFs in particular. We are a leading franchise in SMAs with $100 billion in assets. And this year, we enhanced our position by acquiring O'Shaughnessy Asset Management and its custom indexing platform, Canvas, with positive net flows since acquisition. Today, our ETF AUM is in excess of $11 billion, and we continue to have positive net flows. Our ETF platform is differentiated with approximately 50% of our AUM in actively managed strategies. The evolution of technology in the industry continues to be another area of focus. This year, we made four minority investments in wealth distribution technology firms that expand access to private securities and/or digital assets to individuals. We launched the world's first tokenized US registered mutual fund as well as two digital asset SMA strategies. In June, we opened a second fintech incubator in Singapore and now have corporate investments in 14 early-stage companies, separate from our venture capital funds. In January, we successfully launched the Hello Progress campaign globally to introduce a refreshed view of Franklin Templeton. The campaign reinforced the trusted relationships we have built with clients for 75 years. Highlights the increased breadth of the firm and reflects our commitment to finding innovative ways to meet client needs. Looking forward, we will continue to purposely invest in key areas of growth across all geographies, including technology, alternative assets, customization, wealth management and distribution initiatives that benefit all our investment teams. Of course, none of our efforts this past fiscal year would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees, of which I and our leadership team very much appreciate. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO and COO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results from the fiscal quarter and year. Matt? Matt Nicholls : Thanks, Jenny. Fourth quarter ending AUM was $1.3 trillion, reflecting a decline of 6% from the prior quarter due to market depreciation of $62 billion and long-term net outflows of $20.4 billion. Reinvested distributions were $2.5 billion this quarter. Adjusted revenues decreased by 4% to $1.53 billion, and investment management fees, excluding performance fees, declined 5% from the prior quarter, both primarily due to lower average AUM, which decreased 5% from the prior quarter. Adjusted performance fees increased slightly to $133.3 million, compared to $127.1 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's adjusted effective fee rate, which excludes performance fees, was 38.8 basis points compared to 39.5 basis points in the prior quarter. The prior quarter effective fee rate was slightly higher as a result of the shift in AUM mix and the timing of the closing of Lexington Partners. Adjusted operating expenses were in line with the prior quarter at $1.04 billion. Lower compensation and benefits was offset by an increase in G&A, which included $8 million of episodic expenses. Adjusted operating income declined 13% from the prior quarter to $494.1 million, and adjusted operating margin decreased to 32.2% from 35.3%. Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share declined by 5% to $394.4 million and $0.78 per share, benefiting from a lower tax rate in the quarter. Turning to fiscal year 2022 results. Ending AUM declined by 15% from the prior year, primarily due to market depreciation of $269 billion and long-term net outflows of $27.8 billion, reflecting an increase of 10% from the prior year. Reinvested distributions were $32 billion. While long-term inflows have been challenged in this risk-off environment, long-term outflows improved 11% from the prior year. Adjusted revenues of $6.5 billion increased by 2% from the prior year benefiting from six months of Lexington and increased performance fees, offset by lower average AUM, which declined 2%. Adjusted operating expenses were $4.2 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year including the impact of our acquisitions and increased performance fee compensation, partially offset by expense savings. Excluding performance fee compensation and the impact of six months of Lexington adjusted operating expenses decreased by 1%. This led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.3 billion, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.9%, 180 basis points lower from the prior year. Excluding performance fees, performance fee compensation and the impact of six months of Lexington adjusted operating income decreased by 11%. Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income declined 3% to $1.9 billion, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.63, also a 3% decline. As a reminder, our fourth quarter last year included a one-time tax benefit of $155 million or $0.30 per share. Reflecting challenging market conditions, during the fiscal year, we strengthened the foundation of our business through prudent and disciplined expense management. Amongst other measures, we outsourced our global transfer agency function, simplifying our business while reducing future capital expenditures. This initiative follows the previously announced outsourcing of our fund administration and certain other technology functions. From a capital management perspective, we were able to close the acquisitions of both Lexington Partners and O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, make several minority investments and returned $773 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases and ended the year with $6.8 billion of cash and investments of approximately level with the year earlier. We will continue to prioritize our dividend, purchase shares to hedge our employee share grants and review targeted acquisitions to reach our objectives at an accelerated pace. As Jenny mentioned, our acquisitions have been driven by goals to deliver a diversified range of investment strategies to more clients in more geographies and in vehicles of choice. This diversification has also added significant cash flow and led to new sources of long-term growth and income potential for our corporate shareholders. In this context, with the closing of Alcentra we have further diversified our alternative asset capabilities, which are in aggregate anticipated to generate approximately $1.3 billion in annual management fee revenue, excluding performance fees. Given our global reach, financial flexibility, business model and experience in execution, we're able to attract highly talented teams and partnerships, looking for a combination of investment independence, support and collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities. Looking ahead, these factors position us well to capitalize on potential strategic activity in the sector. And now we would like to open the call up for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. Matt Nicholls : Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : So my question is on Alcentra's investment performance and organic growth. I know this deal just closed, but I was interested to see how the investment performance has trended this year and also how the fundraising and overall organic growth has also trended in 2022? Matt Nicholls : Good morning. Craig. So I think, look, we just announced the closing today, as you mentioned, we're very glad to be closing ahead the schedule by at least, I think, a couple of months. We're very happy with the team. Performance is good. We're now turning to execution with an emphasis on business growth opportunity for the future. And I think the best way to describe it is that our teams together are going to be in marketing mode quite quickly from here on. So I think that's all we can comment so far. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. And Matthew, do I get a follow-up? I forget if it's one or two here? Matt Nicholls : Yeah. Please go ahead, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : All right. Perfect. My next one is on kind of future liabilities given a very active period of M&A. Just remind us what the next few years look like in terms of liability items like earn-outs from the acquisitions you've already announced? Matt Nicholls : Yes. So we have about $1.3 billion of deferred payments that are due on previously announced acquisitions over the next four years. We also have $1.4 billion of debt due over the next five years. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. Thank you, Matthew. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : I think diamonds for 75 years, Jenny, if I did the math correctly, so congrats on that. Jenny Johnson : Thank you. Bill Katz : So question just on expenses. Matt, normally in the press release or the supplement, you'll sort of put some information in there, sort of, how to think about expenses. Given the New Year, you got a lot going on. Revenues are down, you got some deals. Can you give us a sense how we should think about maybe the -- excuse me, the base expense outlook for fiscal 2023? And how to think about whether the fourth quarter -- fiscal fourth quarter as a jumping off point, or we need to normalize and just how to think that through, if you don't mind. Matt Nicholls : Yes. Thank you, Bill. So first of all, as you know, we don't usually give guidance on the revenue front because of -- yes, it's difficult to predict where markets are heading. And obviously, that's a large portion of where revenues go with respect to percentages up or down. But, obviously, we want to just make the point that we're adding Alcentra from today. So that's about $35 billion under management to add to our overall AUM as of today. I'd also increase our effective fee rate because of that and other mix shift that we expect to happen in the next quarter to back to roughly where it was in the last quarter. So let's say, the mid 39s. In terms of expenses, I'll go through the different line items, trying to be as helpful as possible in terms of the modeling. And this is for the first quarter, so first quarter guidance for 2023. And then I know it's very early, obviously, but I'll try and give an annual view also in terms of just our expenses, excluding performance fees. So starting with comp and benefits for the first quarter of 2023, this assumes performance fees of approximately $50 million for the quarter. And we would expect comp and benefits to be essentially flat to the quarter that we just reported, the fourth quarter of 2022. But note that, that does include two months of Alcentra, and it also includes $35 million accelerated deferred comp, which is an annual adjustment, let's say. Two, IS&T, again, first quarter 2023, we'd expect it to be flat to this quarter to the fourth quarter 2022 inclusive of Alcentra, so around $122 million. For occupancy, first quarter 2023. Again, we would increase that to about $60 million, inclusive of Alcentra, and this reflects also a more normalization of return to office. G&A, we expect this to be elevated for the first quarter to approximately $160 million. This includes a one-time TA international outsourcing fee and higher placement fees. Following this quarter, though, for the future quarters, we would expect G&A to go back to approximately where we are at in the fourth quarter 2022 in the mid- to high 140s, but this is inclusive of Alcentra and likely continued occurrence of higher placement fees. It's also worth noting, that G&A guidance also includes higher T&E, as activity returns to more normalized levels. So to give -- to put that into context, just in the second quarter of 2022, our T&E was around $7 million. It's now $15 million, it was $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to probably rise to around $20 million going forward. We expect the tax rate for the quarter, as we've outlined in the executive commentary to be 27%, which is usually elevated and then for the year for it to be 25% to 27%. In terms of the year, again, this is very early, obviously, but we thought this might be helpful that we would say, excluding performance fees, but including the full year of Lexington. Remember, last year, it was only six months of Lexington. So full year 2023 will be 12 months to Lexington, so adds another six months and 11 months of Alcentra as we closed today. So it's another 11 months. So that's an expense of an additional $225 million or something around that nature. Excluding performance fees, we expect expenses to be around $3.95 billion to $4 billion, so very flat to our expenses for 2022. But again, really absorbing all of the additional expenses that come with an additional six months of Lexington in the full -- almost a full year or 11 months of Alcentra. Bill Katz : That's very helpful, thank you, Matthew. And then, Jenny, maybe one for you. Just in terms of -- you listed off a number of things you're doing on the retail democratization side. Can you just maybe level set where you are today in terms of maybe the more major wirehouses, both in the US and your distribution partners globally and where you might be able to sort of increase penetration or just see some market share opportunity? Jenny Johnson : Yes. I mean I'd say, as we talked about, it's complicated as far as it's not just about getting on the platform. There's a lot of education. So we've done a couple of things. We have actually created a \u2013 a separate group that is completely focused on -- it's staffed with specialists, focused on the alternative channel to be able to support the wealth channel wholesaler, right? So they can be pulled in and they'll have a background in all the different areas. And then on the product front, BSP has launched our multi-strat interval fund. CP Reef has a -- has had actually good traction. And up until now, they sort of smaller distributors, and we're now in due diligence with several of the large platforms. You have to have a certain amount of size to be able to get on the larger platforms. And so they're in the process of doing their due diligence there. And then we partnered with both CAIS and iCapital were listed on both of those platforms, which are really important. I actually attended one of the conferences and the top comments from the financial advisers were \u2013 it's so complicated to do the paperwork and the capital calls. And so it's really important that, that is improved in both Case and iCapital are trying to tackle that. So, we are now -- have our products listed on both of those platforms. We feel very good with the progress that we're getting, and it's one of those where -- as the influence start, they -- you're able to then expand on to more and more platforms. So, we feel like we're at that inflection point where the big distributors are now doing their due diligence on them. Bill Katz : Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Thanks Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On Alcentra so you, in the past, have spoken to their distribution capabilities and strengths. Are those primarily on the institutional side? And where does the penetration of the retail channel in Europe stand compared to the US? What's that opportunity set like? Adam Spector : Sure. I think what we're seeing globally is that the adoption of Alta, a more significant portion of the portfolio is occurring in every region we operate in. We see that in Latin America. We see it in Asia, the US, and EMEA. And to the extent that Alcentra runs a lot of European-based product, we think that they have the best shot of increasing their penetration there in the short run. We're going about it the same way we are everywhere in the world. We think we have world-class institutional brand; we've got a wealth management distribution presence. And then what we're doing to boost Alcentra in that market is really to add specialists so that there's a specialist team that works between the investment teams and the general salesforce to make sure that we're telling the story the right way. Because as Jenny said, we think that success in retail also is going to be largely based on ease of access as well as education and that's where we're putting a lot of our efforts now. Given that the transaction was just announced today, we're still early in executing on some of that, but we're working on it now. Brennan Hawken : Thanks. Matt Nicholls : And I'll just add a couple of points to Adam's remarks. Each of our specialist investment managers that we've acquired in the alternative asset space has had an attractive organic growth rate profile based on historical performance and activity in institutional client base. And so there's already that embedded growth rate as we acquire the firms. So, the future potential is on top of that that Adam talks about. So, we expect a natural organic growth rate tied to the institutional side of the business. And then that to be boosted, as Adam mentioned, more of the wealth management channels. The additional acquisition targets that we look at that will complete our sort of build out, if you will, of the alternative asset specialist investment managers are exactly the same. They're all institutionally-focused with embedded growth rates on the institutional side, of which we believe there are some very interesting opportunities in the broader channels where Franklin can leverage. Jenny Johnson : And I'm just going to add one more thing on that. There's always a home country bias that people have when they're making investments. And I can tell you, we're in positive net flows in the EMEA region. And this -- the excitement by the distribution team of just having local credit -- private credit, it was really important to expand that capability. So we're optimistic there. Adam Spector : Great. Brennan Hawken : Thanks a lot. Adam Spector : And the final thing is how excited we are about all. Brennan Hawken : Yes, here we go. I hit a live wire with this one. Adam Spector : We\u2019re going on alternative. Each of our alts firms is institutionally focused historically and has long-standing distribution, but we are supplementing that with FT relationships where we have particular strength and we're seeing that benefit each and every one of our firms. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Sorry, ST. Jenny Johnson : Franklin Templeton. Adam Spector : Correct. Franklin Templeton. Brennan Hawken : Yes, yes. Got it. Franklin Templeton. Sorry, that's -- yes, that's obvious. Okay. Thanks for all of that. Really appreciate the thorough color. I'd love to transit into maybe a more mundane topic on expenses. And so, Matthew, thinking about the -- I know you caveated it, right, early days and whatnot. You helped us sort of quantify the -- what your expectation is for an uplift to T&E. And obviously, it's an inflationary environment that you've got Alcentra. But how much is Alcentra adding into that 3.95 to 4 base? And how much do you have wiggle room in order to continue to grind that down through the year as we work through this very, very challenging environment. Matt Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Brennan. So on Alcentra, it's approximately $100 million. And as I mentioned, we expect to absorb all of that into our cost base. By absorb it, I don't mean cut it. And we're finding other places within Franklin Templeton to be more efficient so that we end up with an attractive expense base given the very difficult market conditions. So I want to make that clear. We're not cutting costs over in London in the company we just acquired. So this is how -- this is where scale can matter where we can find other places to be more efficient across the platform. I think what you're sort of getting at in a way is the margin. And I think we do expect the margin to go a little bit down before it comes back up. I'll just point to a couple of important things. 35% to 40% of our adjusted expense base is variable with the market, but we're also very focused, Jenny asked me to do this in sort of one of my new roles here, is to be very focused on the other 60% to 65%. So even though 35% to 40% is truly variable with the marketing performance, we do have other interesting areas to explore. In the down market of this magnitude, it takes time for, I would, sort of, call it, carefully considered adjustments to keep up with the sharp revenue declines that the industry is facing. But while making sure that we remain competitive in terms of compensation and investing in the business, investing in the business right now, given the evolution of change in our industry is probably more important than at any time. It is extremely important to keep up with where things are heading. However, we have already taken or are in the process of taking action, such as pausing nonessential hiring. We're -- and we've announced a voluntary buyout, which excludes investment staff. That's, in our view, a very effective and fair way to downsize our headcount and we have execution plans to introduce additional operational efficiencies across the firm, things like spanner control, layering. You call it mundane, but it's extremely important to get these things right. And in the firm of our size, we think we do have meaningful levels. And hopefully, we've demonstrated in the past few years even when the markets are going up, in addition to the savings from our merger transaction, we've already outsourced various activities, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's created efficiencies for our funds, importantly, so our fund shareholders frankly, benefited the most from the decisions we've made to outsource. But importantly, it's lowered future capital expenditures from a corporate perspective. And this is all about lowering our future capital output in operational areas that are not core to our growth. And it also simplifies our company operations by doing -- by operating this way by having this discipline, not just as the market deteriorated, but frankly, over the last three years, it's enabled us to continue to invest in wealth tech alternatives, SMA customization, distribution, all the things that we spend quite a lot of time talking about. And I think you'll see us to continue to be very active strategically and investing in our business as a result of our ability to be able to reduce expenses even in this -- and keep up in this difficult environment. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for all the color. Matt Nicholls : Thanks Brennan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rick Roy : Yeah, hi good morning. This is actually Rick Roy on for Dan. So just thinking about the macro set for fixed income in the coming year, several of your peers have highlighted the potential for increased allocations to fixed income, just given the historically beneficial setup that we've seen. So with the performance of certain flagship Western products that at least the ones that are visible to us, do you see them as the Western franchise as a share winner or loser in this environment? And then maybe just adding on to that, any color on the Brandywine and legacy Franklin fixed income product set would also be helpful. Jenny Johnson : Adam, do you want? Adam Spector : Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're thrilled about the opportunity for fixed income to offer more value to investors. Right now, fixed income finally has yield embedded in across all the sectors. We have about 121 fixed income composites that we can offer investors and 45 of those are outperforming on the one, three, five and 10-year periods. So we have tremendously attractive fixed income in a range of categories. Core fixed income Core and Core Plus were obviously under pressure this year. But what we've seen is that we're able to compete really very effectively at the shorter end of the curve in credit products in multi-sector and global and we're seeing significant wins there. Despite the performance, Western Core and Core Plus are some of our absolute biggest growth sales products with healthy pipeline and we're excited for that to continue. So a tough year in performance in some spots, but a really good fixed income lineup across the board. The other thing that we've been able to do effectively this year is to pivot out of fixed income securities to equity income strategies, multi-asset class income with our income fund, how things like infrastructure income and able to produce income without duration. So to the extent that people are still worried about rising rates, we have other opportunities, but within traditional fixed income, a range of things that are exciting, and we are seeing increased demand from investors. Rick Roy : Got it. Appreciate the extra context around that. And then if I may, just on the performance fees, obviously, has been somewhat elevated the last two quarters at least. So how might we think about performance fee eligible AUM and where that sits currently, obviously, with Alcentra now in the mix and what assets are below any high watermarks. Just to get an idea of going into next year? Matt Nicholls : Yes. I don't think we changed our guidance on this. I realize that we have had another quarter of increasing or higher performance fees than we talked about on our previous call, the guidance we've given, which is around $50 million. But I'd just say that about $55 million or so, the performance fees from the fourth quarter was from clients rebalancing or taking strong returns off the table and this triggered an accelerated performance fee payout. So I don't think we were too far above what we suggested, we'd be at except for this acceleration through rebalancing. In terms of the performance, what assets under management or our performance fees linked to it's very much in line with the AUM that has been highlighted in our \u2013 in our remarks, which is the full $260 billion. Of course, some of that's quarterly, some of it is annual. But the potential for performance fees in the future in our business is very significant. The $55 million of rebalancing related performance fees, let's say, is not from a very large rebalancing. It has to be said, it's but they produced a very strong performance fee. And we're so far above the performance threshold in those assets under management that if there's other rebalancing, we will get higher performance fees. But again, I would just stay to the guidance that we provided, it's extremely hard for our guidance and performance fees, as you all know. Not that doesn't mean we're not confidence in our performance is very strong across all of our alternative asset specialist investment managers. But I think $50 million for \u2013 for modeling purposes is the right number. Rick Roy : Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Matt Nicholls : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Cho : Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Michael Cho in for Ken. I just wanted to just go back, follow up on the 2023 framework that was provided. I guess Matt, you talked about investing in the business and it seems more important than ever. And I guess my question is, in terms of your intention to continue investing and diversify your business in terms of alts and wealth and fintech I guess, would your intention also would be to increase or decrease or even \u2013 even maintain the pace of investment when we think about the efforts to diversify the business as we look into 2023. Matt Nicholls : In terms of -- if you define investing in the business in areas where basically we have very little operating income today that we expect to grow in the future, we're increasing that substantially in 2023 because we think there's very substantial opportunities in the future. So we intend to increase our investment in that area. I'll ask Jenny if you. Jenny Johnson : Maybe I misunderstood the question. But here's -- we've, I think, been pretty clear on how we think about acquisitions from that investment standpoint. And our view is, I think we have the broadest lineup of alternative managers of any traditional asset manager. And I think if you just compare our performance fees, to other traditional managers, you'll see the impact of that. Yes, we still have some areas of gaps, things like infrastructure and then we've talked about globalizing the various types of capabilities we have. And so if those opportunities came up, we'd be interested. The other areas that we've talked about is increasing distribution. So, any kind of investments that help us increase our distribution capability as well as the wealth channel. So, those are the three that we look at. We would say that right now the bar is higher because we're digesting some big acquisitions. But on the other hand -- and I think this is a product of a company that still has founder involvement and has been around for 75 years. We always keep cash available because we want to be opportunistic if something comes up, and we feel that we have that flexibility. But we're also going to be very picky because we're really happy with the lineup that we have currently. Matt Nicholls : Yes. I just emphasize that our number one priority, and I think Jenny just mentioned this clearly is organic growth strategy internally. So, the question you had around have -- are we increasing the dollar investments organically? The answer is yes. We are increasing those. In terms of the other activity around M&A, as Jenny mentioned, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have $6.8 billion of cash and investments. That's roughly level with last year, exactly this time last year after two important acquisitions and four minority investments and other investments we've made in the business, of course, a lot of that is made possible through operating income, cash flow and so on. But when we look forward and when you think about the guidance I just provided, to you. We still have the room to make the organic investments, which are very important. But also we have to -- our balance sheet to continue to make targeted acquisitions, which, as Jenny mentioned, the bar is higher now, but the level of interest in some of these things is certainly not waned in any way. Jenny Johnson : And just to give you some color on kind of the organic investments, I mean -- and these are all incorporated into Matt's guidance. But the Franklin Templeton Alternatives Group that we've set up is really newly staffed with expertise in distributing to the wealth channel alternatives, and that's a pretty substantial investment there as well as we continue to invest in FinTech and have investments in tools that can be leveraged by financial advisers, those are not profitable on their own, they're profitable when you add the models and other capabilities to them, but you have to constantly invest. All of that is incorporated in our earnings guidance. Michael Cho : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just coming back to Alcentra, can you talk about where you see the most compelling opportunity set to accelerate the growth at Alcentra. Is that from retail distribution in Europe? And maybe you could talk about what actions you might take there with Alcentra to help them accelerate growth? Adam Spector : Yeah, absolutely. I think the first thing we want to state is that they've got a really high quality team on their own. We've met with them recently, and we think standalone, they can do quite well. That being said, we have a huge footprint in the EMEA region. As Jenny said, we find there's a significant home bias, home market bias to all investors, retail and institutional. And what we've seen with some of our other alternative capabilities that we try to distribute in EMEA is that there can be a desire for more European based private credit. So we think that is one of the areas where we can take our significant footprint in the region and added to their institutional capabilities. I would say that in the wealth management channel, that is more greenfield. That's going to be where there's fewer assets at play where allocations are rising significantly. There, I think being an earlier player focusing on education, focusing on making the placement easier will give us a leg up there. The final thing I would note is that while I think most of our Alt managers are strong in the major markets, it really helps at FT where we have a presence on the ground in over 30 markets. So in some of those smaller markets where our alternative firms might not get to on their own, and we have significant relationships. That's the place where we can really boost distribution. Matt Nicholls : I think the additional thing I would add to Adam's comments is I think it's important to note the fact that this transaction is one that we described as globalizing a specialist investment manager we already have in DSP. So we're globalizing the business. And Alcentra and BSP becoming part of a global team as opposed to a largely US and a large European business. That helps with fundraising, it helps with strategy formation. It helps with talent retention and origination. We just become a more interesting place for both investors, ideas, and talent. And that was one of the reasons why we thought this was very compelling and why we acquired Alcentra is something that another -- the point that Jenny mentioned a second go around the bar being high. Obviously, the first thing we always ask ourselves is can we do this ourselves? Can we build this business organically? And there are some things that just frankly take too long to get to a leadership position or even frankly gain credibility in a particular strategic area. And in our view, it would have taken us too long to do these ourselves. So we're delighted to acquire Alcentra for that to help globalize also outstanding PSP team and leadership. Michael Cyprys : Great. And just a follow-up question. Maybe more for Jenny, I wanted to come back to the money fund that you guys cited as registered to use the blockchain. I was hoping you could elaborate on that. What's the timing and process look like to bring that to the marketplace? How an individual or institution may be able to access that fund and the benefits that you see there? Jenny Johnson : Yeah. So it's a tokenized money market fund, technically, you could go on at the Apple Store and download the Benji app and have a wallet that accesses that money market fund. We built a transfer agency system on the blockchain. So all the shareholders' books and records are there. That I'm a believer that you will see 40 Act funds expressed over time in tokenized records. And that will have an impact on things like ETFs and traditional mutual funds. If you think about a token, it can have a smart contract that prices all the underlying investments immediately, so you can always have an NAV that's dynamic, even ETFs are only priced a couple of times a day. So we did it, because we think that this is an important space that's going to happen over time, and we wanted to understand the marketplace there. And we are talking to firms about how to leverage it. You have to hold those tokens in a crypto wallet, so if that isn't part of your infrastructure as a distributor, it's not that valuable to you today, but it will be over time. We also did an investment in a company called Eaglebrook, and we have several strategies there. Where they are fundamental research on some of the coins in the marketplace, we think these two things ultimately converge. Where you'll have traditional sort of investment capabilities that are held in a token or coin and you will have companies that will be reflected by a coin and investors will have both on their platform. But, I think, it's really early stages in this. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please, go ahead. Brian Bedell : Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. First one for Matthew, just a clarification on the 2022 adjusted expenses excluding performance fees. I know we've used the formula for that typically, but do you have a precise amount -- dollar amount for this fiscal year? Matt Nicholls : You mean 2023, Brian? Brian Bedell : No, no. 2022, the actual -- so the adjusted expenses, excluding performance fee compensation. Matt Nicholls : All right. For the end of the year, yes, it's around $3.87 billion so -- Brian Bedell : 3.78. Matt Nicholls : That, as you -- we guided -- as you may remember, in the last call, we guided to 3.9% to 3.95% and then I said we'd be on the lower end of that -- so we're actually about $35 million inside of our guidance. Brian Bedell : Okay. Perfect. Great. And then, Jenny, if I can ask you or Adam, if you can give us an update on your view on sustainable or dedicated sustainable products at Franklin. Maybe just sort of an update on the AUM you have in those products. I realize, of course, ESG is utilized throughout the investment process across the firm. But what I'm trying to sort of get out of the actual dedicated products that have that as the primary investment objective. And Jenny, maybe just your view on what's happening in Europe with Article 8 and Article 9 reclassifications, if you think that's going to accelerate or they're going to get may be more disciplined and not raise the bar a little bit more to clear those hurdles. Jenny Johnson : So, I actually think the way to describe kind of the ESG is actually looking at the European framework with Article 8, 9 and Article 6, because it -- I actually think they do a pretty good job of defining it. You see Asia following it, and I think the US will probably model the concepts around it. So we have about $35 billion in 48 strategies and Article 8 and 9 and positive flows there. We were very conservative, I think, in our initial evaluation. Our compliance group was quite active in determining what would be categorized in those 6, 8, 9. So we feel very good about that. I think you're only going to see more requirement around transparency and to document how your process is, whatever you say show us that you're doing it and most regulators you see it in the US, you see it in Europe are saying, if you don't document and show us that you're actually doing what you say you're doing, we're not going to give you credit for it. You see it was like the UK 2022 stewardship code. Again, it's all about kind of documentation there. I do think that there is a recognition a couple of things. One is that you should measure ESG considerations with risk to the underlying company and then portfolios to the risk of externalities. And that often these get blended, I think you're going to start my just gut feel is, over time, there will almost be two different measurements for that. So I think that's a natural progression. And then I think that there's a recognition that, oh, by the way, we're fiduciaries. And so you need to consider returns in all of this, and that has to be part of the measurement as well. And I think you capture that in the Stewardship Code, the UK Stewardship Code 2. So I think it's here to stay. I think it's just a natural evolution of transparency and over time better and better data and remembering that we're all fiduciaries and then I will again remind that we are asset managers, not asset owners. So we are at the discretion of our clients as far as their desires, and we talk and educate them on things, but in the end, it's their money. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO for final comments. End of Q&A: Jenny Johnson : Great. Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call. And once again, I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work this past fiscal year and they are laser focused on our clients, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for the first fiscal quarter of 2023. I'm joined by Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. We're pleased to answer any questions you have. But first, I'd like to call out a few highlights from the quarter.  Despite the challenging market backdrop in our first fiscal quarter, we saw a number of positive developments to further diversify our business. This quarter, we continue to see net inflows into key growth areas such as into our 3 largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington Partners as well as multi-asset strategies, ETF and our custom indexing solution platform, Canvas.  We were also pleased to see additional positive indicators impacting our business, including an increase in our institutional won but unfunded pipeline and improving overall investment performance across our strategies. I'll cover all of this in more detail momentarily. While the industry landscape remained under pressure, we have continued to benefit from our diversified mix of asset classes, geographies, client types and investment vehicles.  Turning now to flows. We generated total net inflows of $6.6 billion this quarter, inclusive of $17.5 billion of net inflows from cash management. Long-term net outflows were $10.9 billion and included reinvested distributions of $12.1 billion. This quarter, we saw net inflows into key growth areas of client demand. Starting with alternatives, as mentioned earlier, our 3 largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington Partners each had net inflows for the quarter totaling $2.4 billion.  Multi-asset net flows increased almost fivefold from the prior quarter to $2.4 billion, driving the interest in the multi-asset category was our flagship Franklin Income Fund with its flexible approach to changing market conditions. The $70 billion U.S. fund is now rated 4 stars overall by Morningstar and continues to have strong performance.  Our broader, multi-asset solutions strategies were also in net inflows. Fixed income net outflows of $13.3 billion were primarily due to certain U.S. taxable and global opportunistic strategies. Client interest, however, continued and we benefited from having a broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies, including net inflows into certain Core Bond, U.S. Income and tax-efficient strategies.  We are pleased to note that Western's performance reverted back to its leadership position during the quarter. At quarter end, 89% of the firm's strategies outperformed the benchmark on an AUM basis for the quarter and Western's 2 primary core bond funds were ranked in the top decile on a quarter-to-date basis versus their respective peer groups.  Equity net inflows were $300 million and included $9 billion in reinvested distributions. This quarter, the risk-off environment continued to impact investor sentiment on certain growth strategies, which were offset by positive net flows into strategies such as large cap and all-cap value, large-cap core and emerging markets. Cash management generated the highest net inflows in over a decade, with $17.5 billion of inflows were driven by institutional demand for low-risk assets at a higher risk-free rate and diversified across client type.  As a leading SMA provider, particularly in model delivery, we ended the quarter at $105 billion in SMA AUM. Canvas has achieved net inflows every quarter since the platform launched in September 2019 and AUM increased over 25% in the quarter. ETFs had $1 billion in net inflows and reached $13.3 billion in AUM. We launched the ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF during the quarter and added specialized sales resources to strengthen our ETF efforts.  We were also pleased to see our institutional pipeline of won but not funded mandates increased by $8.8 billion to $23.8 billion and included a $7.5 billion fixed income institutional mandate. Turning now to performance. Our investment teams have remained true to their distinct disciplines and time-tested approaches, relentlessly searching for those long-term investment opportunities that market dislocations often present.  We saw an uptick in relative investment performance in nearly all standard time periods. This quarter, the majority of our strategy composite AUM and mutual funds AUM outperformed their benchmarks and peers, respectively, on a 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year basis. In addition, 51% of mutual fund AUM was in funds rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar. As I've said time and again, the next decade is not likely to look like the last and we continue to invest strategically in areas that are shaping the future of our industry. Alternative investing is one of those areas. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Alcentra, a leading European alternative credit manager. This acquisition increased our alternative credit AUM to $78.5 billion. And as for secondary private equity, as of November 30, Lexington had raised $12.8 billion for its latest fund and continues its fundraising efforts. Alternative assets now account for $257 billion, or 19% of our total AUM and a higher percentage of adjusted revenue. We are now one of the largest managers of alternative assets and are realizing our aspiration to be one of the few diversified firms globally that offers the major categories of alternative assets. One of the lessons that 2022 taught many investors is that diversifying beyond traditional asset classes to solve for their long-term goals is probably a good idea. We think this will drive increased adoption of alternative assets in the wealth channel where we've made progress.  We continue to focus on product development and suitability, sales and marketing and client education and the distribution of alternatives and wealth management. For example, Benefit Street Partners announced the launch of Franklin BSP Private Credit Fund, investing in U.S. middle market private credit seeking to generate strong current income and superior risk-adjusted returns across market cycles.  In November, the Franklin Templeton Academy announced the launch of its alternative education program as part of our ongoing effort to build knowledge and proficiency around the alternative investment landscape. The program offers a comprehensive curriculum on various types of alternatives, including courses on private equity, real estate, private credit, infrastructure and hedge strategies.  Touching briefly on our financial results, which reflect 2 months of Alcentra given its closing on November 1. Ending AUM was $1.39 trillion, an increase of 7% from the prior quarter, primarily due to market appreciation and the addition of Alcentra. Average AUM decreased by 1.5% to $1.35 trillion.  Adjusted revenues were $1.44 billion, a decrease of 6% from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by lower adjusted performance fees and lower average AUM. However, the effective fee rate, which excludes performance fees, was 39 basis points, a slight uptick compared to 38.8 basis points last quarter.  Adjusted operating income was $395.1 million, a decline of 20% from the prior quarter or 12% excluding annual deferred compensation acceleration for retirement eligible employees of $37 million. We continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet with total cash and investments of $6.6 billion at quarter end after reflecting the purchase of Alcentra and payment of fiscal year-end cash bonuses.  Let me wrap up by saying that over our 75-year history, our North Star has always been the clients we serve. We are committed to continuing to seek opportunities to expand our capabilities to provide investors with financial investments that are important in reaching their goals. Finally, I would like to thank our global employees without whom our progress would not be possible. Their work is greatly appreciated, and I thank them for their many contributions to our organization. Now let's turn it over to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Glenn Schorr : I guess a question on the fixed income side. We saw outflows in the fourth quarter, but the outlook for '23 should be a lot better for the industry. Just curious on that thought overall and how you think Western in particular is positioned in the year ahead? Jennifer Johnson : Great. Thanks, Glenn. I mean, first of all, as we mentioned in the quarter, the core bond portfolio Western had net flows, we continue to see really strong sales -- on the gross sales for Western products. 89% of the strategies outperformed. Actually, Core Plus and Core ranks second and eighth [ percentage ] in there against their peers for the quarter. So really good -- I think, good recent performance. The pipeline -- over $10 billion of the pipeline is Western. As we mentioned, the $7.5 billion mandate is part of Western's. But beyond that, they're just getting great support.  But I -- here's what makes us really excited. Many of the institutional players have been a little bit slow. That's why I think we've seen real strength in our institutional money funds and a lot of flows going there, both in the last quarter and continuing through January. As you see institutions waiting to figure out kind of when the rates peak. But as they ventured back into the space, we have 3 phenomenal brands between Franklin, Brandywine and Western. And to just punctuate that the Brandywine Global versus Western Core Plus and Franklin Core Plus from their excess returns, only correlate [ 0.12 and 0.17 ]. So regardless of what type of view people have on fixed income, we've got really, really great brands in that area. Adam, do you want to add anything to that? Adam Spector : Yes. I would just add, Jenny, that the performance turnaround is really across the board. If you look at where our Global Bond Fund is, that's now top decile as well. So really good performance everywhere. On top of that, I would say that one of the things that differentiates us is the breadth of fixed income we offer. We see a number of DB plans now more fully funded. We're able to offer them liability based fixed income. You can look at what we do in high yield and global bonds and munis. It's really a breadth of capability in fixed income, and we're seeing demand grow in all of those sectors. Glenn Schorr : Jenny, maybe I'll keep it at the high level because look, the margin compression is impossible to manage when the market drops as much as it did. Again, as you think rolling forward, we got the benefit of the market lift in the fourth quarter and early this year. Just curious on how you're thinking about what you do actively and proactively in '23 and where you think we can get to a \"normal\" backdrop if there's such a thing? Jennifer Johnson : Sorry. So are you asking in the sense of what M&A, in the sense of expense... Glenn Schorr : I apologize. I'm really talking about the adjusted margin and expenses, just expenses up, revenues down, it's hard to do in the short term when the markets drop. But how you're approaching that margin? Or is that an outcome? In other words, do you manage towards it? Or is it an outcome of the environment? Jennifer Johnson : So I don't think we manage [ for ] margin and I'll let Matt jump in on this. But you're absolutely right. I mean this is one of those businesses where you get a disproportionate benefit to the markets going on the upside because your margins can expand and then you're slammed on the downside because you can't possibly adjust your expenses quickly enough.  I think the good news is the work we've been doing. Part of it is just when you do the amount of M&A we do, you're naturally kind of reinventing how you work and figuring out where you can take out costs. And so we've been able to absorb a lot of the expenses that we've had in the M&A.  But Matt, you want to talk about kind of expectations on margins going forward based on where the market is. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean, I'll just say a few things on that, and I'm happy to provide the guide. Maybe that would be another question that will come up. But generally speaking, 35% to 40% of our adjusted expense base, as we've communicated in the past, is variable in nature with the market and performance. And we're always very much looking at the other 60% to 65% of our expense base to see if we can be more efficient and effective in particular in a difficult environment.  And frankly, some of the transactions we've done on the M&A side have prompted further reviews of those sorts of activities. So we're very active around that. In the down market, as you alluded to, Glenn, that we've experienced, it takes some time for carefully consider adjustments to keep up with revenue declines while making sure that we remain competitive in terms of compensation and investing in the business, and we've done both of those things, competitive in comp, and we continue to invest in the business in a significant way, in our opinion. But we've also taken or in the process of taking significant action across the business to make sure that we're being disciplined and continue to be disciplined with our expenses. So we paused nonessential hiring. We've just completed a voluntary buyout process, excluding our investment staff. We've got an execution plan in place to introduce additional operational efficiencies across the firm.  As you know, in the last 3 years, in addition to savings from our merger transaction, we've already outsourced operational activity that's created efficiencies for our funds, first and foremost, but have also lowered future CapEx expenditures for our firm, while frankly, also simplifying our company operations. And what this has enabled us to do is to continue to invest heavily in the business where we need to in the areas of growth that we've talked a lot about. But at the same time, it's also enabled us to keep our expenses very much in check, including the margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : So Jenny, you mentioned fixed income performance has really improved. Is one quarter of great performance enough given the more positive backdrop for fixed income and credit? And what is the risk that there's a lot of money movement in the industry in fixed income for 2023 and Franklin misses it due to weaker performance from last year. Jennifer Johnson : Well, again, I mean you have the Core Bond, which was the net flows of I think of $1.5 billion this quarter. And Core Plus is one of our top-selling selling funds. So even though it's still in the net outflows, it's dramatically improved in outflows. Templeton Global Bond, I mean, it's amazing when you look at that, as Adam mentioned, it is beating its benchmark and peers in all 4 time periods. So it's a pretty massive turnaround. I think it's outperforming its benchmark by 1,200 basis points for the quarter (sic) [ year ], which you carry that back. So performance is always going to predict the future. If you look at that 87 of 134 fixed income composites. So this is across the firm in the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods is only underperforming in 1 period. So we actually think we're incredibly well positioned. And again, as I mentioned earlier, the diversification of the excess returns between Brandywine, Franklin and Western gives people a chance frankly hedge themselves within our own enterprise or if they have a view can express it with one of our managers. And as we've said that Western has been a little bit more viewing that I think that rates will probably decline, maybe towards the end of the year, which the Franklin side probably would say it's more like in 2024. So the key is that I think we have great opportunities wherever you want to be in the fixed income, and we think that people now that you can get actual returns in fixed income, you're going to see more allocations there. Matthew Nicholls : Sorry, that's not just the public markets that's the private markets also. So Benefits Street Partners, Alcentra. So they've got some very strong performance and interesting funds and both in demand. Adam Spector : Yes, I was just going to say we've seen clients build multi-fixed income fleets with different Franklin components and oftentimes adding additional assets because they see how uncorrelated the various strategies are with each other. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : I was hoping we can dig into your alt franchise for a couple of minutes. If we look at the AUM, excluding Alcentra this quarter, AUM seems to be kind of flat, actually down a little bit sequentially. So I'm just curious what's offsetting sort of the good fundraising momentum that you mentioned. Now I know the convention [ of ] AUM is not the same as fee-paying AUM. So maybe just kind of help us unpack what fee-paying AUM has done over the last couple of quarters, what it is now? And what are the drivers of fee-paying AUM in alts over the next several quarters? Jennifer Johnson : Matt, do you want to take the fee-paying AUM? Matthew Nicholls : The core of the question and then Jenny and Adam, you should answer more, is the outflows and the softness that we've experienced in alternatives, Alex, is driven by the liquid alts area of the firm. It's not our primary kind of private market specialist investment managers in BSP, Clarion and Lexington have all experienced positive flows and organic growth. So I think what you're referring to is the overall number when you exclude Alcentra, where that is. It's slightly negative. That's driven by outflows and softness in both performance and flows on the liquid alts side. Jennifer Johnson : So that would be -- K2 and Western macro opps would be the 2 areas that you're seeing. Everything else has actually grown -- in the Lexington, Benefit Street Partners and Clarion have all grown. Alexander Blostein : Yes. And can you help us just break down fee-paying AUM, kind of what's liquid versus what's illiquid? And as you sort of think about the pipeline of opportunities on the more private side of things. It would be helpful just to get a little more granularity. So for instance, like the Lexington $12.5 billion or $12.8 billion fundraise, is already all in the fee-paying AUM number? And is it a management fee? Or is that going to turn on once the fund is closing? So just a little more granularity, that would be helpful. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. The Lexington fund that's -- go ahead, Jenny. Jennifer Johnson : Go ahead, Matt. Matthew Nicholls : The Lexington fund that's being raised so far, that's all fee paying. So it's the future raise that they're continuing to work on that isn't yet included. But the number that we put into the executive commentary is included. Jennifer Johnson : And basically, when you ask for liquid versus illiquid or tied up -- I'm assuming you're talking about tied up assets. Essentially, most of BSP, Clarion and Lexington Partners are all long-term tied up assets. Obviously, K2 has their liquid alts. So those have more flexibility, and you see that in redemption numbers as well as macro opps. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Maybe just for a quick follow-up. I was hoping you guys could hit on the institutional pipeline. Very nice to see an improvement sequentially. Can you talk to the fee rate on the overall institutional pipeline? And the timing of conversions as you expect it today? Adam Spector : Yes. I would say that the timing is going to be typical of what we've seen in the past. I think it's usually about half of that pipeline or so converts in the quarter. I wouldn't see a real change in that. In terms of the fee rate, we tend to have scaled fee schedules. So when you have larger mandates, those priced a little cheaper than smaller mandates, we have a big chunky one in there right now. But in general, I don't see that the fees we've been charging on institutional asset management changing all that much quarter-over-quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Credit Suisse. William Katz : I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about where you see the exit base fee rate at the end of the year versus what you sort of reported. And then as you think about your commentary about sort of money continue to go into institutional cash management, and some of these larger fixed income mandates. How does that sort of play off against what's happening on the alternative side? Matthew Nicholls : Bill. So on the fee rate, we expect it to remain around 39 basis points, and it may be slightly higher than that for the year as a whole, but that's where we expect it to be, as we've discussed in the past. And you know this well, that the upward pressure on the fee rate is if we are more successful in expanding our alternative asset business and if equities continue to come back that pushes up. If we get this continued flow into money market funds and broader fixed income on the institutional side, in particular, that could push the fee rate down. But as we've modeled that, and looked at the mix of our business, we think that 39 basis points is a very reasonable -- excluding performance fees is a very reasonable guide for the EFR. William Katz : Okay. And as a follow-up, I was wondering, Matt, if you could talk a little bit about -- maybe update us on expenses and how to think about maybe the run rate numbers. So a couple of variables looking at the quarter. Sort of unpack the $37 million on the deferred comp side. Does that pull forward [ as ] expenses? And then your guidance last quarter was much more elevated for some of the [ non-comps ] what you reported. Can you talk a little bit about any timing issues there or how to think about the rest of the year? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Bill. Yes. There was some movement with respect to some of the numbers in the different components from one quarter to another. But what I'll do is, I'll walk through where we see the second quarter of '23 in terms of different components. And then I'll give you a high level of where we think we're going to be for the entire year also, which hopefully would be helpful for modeling purposes.  So I already mentioned to you about 39 basis points for the effective fee rate. That's where we see things remaining in the next quarter. All these numbers obviously are inclusive of continuing to invest in the franchise and a full quarter of Alcentra. Last quarter, which was 2 months this quarter, of course, it's the full -- it will be the full 3 months.  For comp and benefits, assuming $50 million of performance fees, and I'm happy to answer a separate performance-fee question, but assuming $50 million per quarter for performance fees, the comp and benefits should be back down to between $700 million and $710 million. This is inclusive of salary increases and the 401(k) and health plan resets.  So again, comp and benefits $700 million to $710 million. We expect IS&T to be between $115 million and $120 million, so it's relatively flat. We expect occupancy to be around $60 million, relatively flat, and this is inclusive of continued normalization of return to office that we're seeing on a global level. G&A, we guide to a high 140, so $147 million, $148 million something in that area. This is inclusive of our estimate of where we expect placement fees to be and also reflects continued normalization of T&E expenses, which we put in the $15 million, $20 million per quarter [ zone ]. We expect the tax rate to remain in 25% to 27% area. If you think about annual guidance, again, inclusive of continued important investments in our organic growth strategies, it's obviously still pretty early in the year, and we're experiencing slightly market uncertainty, as we've all been talking about. But all else remaining equal, despite the improved market conditions in the quarter, which has been somewhat of a surprise, I think, to us at all, we're going to stay with the annual guidance that I provided last quarter, which is for the year, adjusted operating expenses between $3.95 billion to $4 billion, we'll probably be on the higher end of that, frankly, because of where markets have gone to over the last month or so.  But we're keeping the guide between $3.95 billion and $4 billion, excluding performance fees -- performance fee compensation. Just a reminder that this includes a full year of Lexington. Last year's numbers was only 6 months. It's an additional 6 months of Lexington Partners plus an 11 months of Alcentra as we closed on November [indiscernible] fiscal year-end is 9/30. So on a net basis, our expense all else remaining equal or projected to be lower than last year, taking into account the Lexington and Alcentra additions, lower by low single digits, 2%, 3%, something in that area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Thinking about what drove the variance, Matthew, to the fee rate last quarter. What do you think caused that to work out to be different than you had expected and a little bit lower? And how should we think about potentially those factors playing into the outlook for the fee rate to be stable at 39. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So we decided to -- or our partners at Lexington Partners decided to hold off on a closing from what they're expecting to do a little bit more in December and they decided to hold off until this quarter that we're in now. So that was probably something like a 0.4 basis point difference.  And then product mix was something like a 0.3 difference from where we were thinking that we could be on the high end of the 39s. So I think I said we expect it to be more in the mid-39s. It could have been as high as 39.7 or 39.8 or something like that, could have been as low as 39 and I sort of guided in the middle of that, we ended up being a bit low because of those 2 things.  The reason for the increase in the EFR from 38.8 to 39 was because of we increased alternatives, we added Alcentra, that probably added something like 0.3 basis points. And then as we've mentioned, we added quite significant money market assets, which is not a really low fee, by the way, but it's obviously a lower fee than alternative assets is probably something like 0.1 or 0.05 of the difference.  And the reason why we feel comfortable with 39 is when we roll the business forward and we look at the projections for our alternative asset business, reasonable market assumptions around equity and even with the significant opportunity in fixed income, one is neatly sort of offsetting the other, and we cut out to around 39 basis points. We think that's a reasonable guide. Brennan Hawken : Appreciate that -- forward-looking comments on fee rates are challenging. Thanks for that additional color, that's helpful. When we think about -- you guys have spoken a lot about the bond outlook and the increased interest. So that's it's a very, very helpful context. One of the components of concern that I hear from investors is the deterioration that we saw last year in Western's performance track record. Can you speak to whether or not this interest is pertaining to some of those strategies that do tend to be larger. That has fallen on to tougher times on the performance end of things? Or is it into other products? Or is the interest happening despite that setback in performance because there's focused on -- there's a focus on different sort of time frames and whatnot. Any additional color would be great. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. I mean I think the message that we're giving is there's a lot of interest in Western. I mean their Core Bond and Core Bond Plus are some of our biggest grossing sales funds and Core Bond netted $1.5 billion this quarter. So Brennan, I think we feel really good about Western and the flows there. Adam Spector : Yes, I would say that also Core Plus is still our biggest selling fund, right? They had some performance challenges, but clients stuck with them. They've been doing this for a long time. And again, 89% of their AUM outperformed for the quarter. Matthew Nicholls : Sorry, I was on mute. The other thing I was going to add to that is again, maybe it's an obvious statement. But on the institutional side, in particular, investors expect to have a consistent process and a view from a portfolio management perspective and Western has stuck to what they said they're going to do. And this is the outcome from that. And -- but we have a very broad range, as Jenny mentioned, of other views internally. And so we have a lot of fixed income opportunities, whether one works well or not, there's others that will offset that. So a lot of opportunities across the franchise, both public and private markets. Adam Spector : And Western's pipeline is building significantly as we speak. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : So my question is on retail alts. Many pure alt firms have been building out their retail distribution efforts pretty aggressively [ since ] 2020. But Franklin has always had a very strong retail effort going back kind of more than 20 years. So I wanted to hear you articulate how you're using your global retail distribution really as an advantage for your old affiliates like Clarion, Lexington, Benefit Street? And also how the affiliates are also leveraging their own local sales teams versus Franklin at the center? Jennifer Johnson : So I'll start and then, Adam, why don't you jump in. So I think look, retail alts is really complicated. And it's really complicated because you have to start by, one, you have to have the right products that sit in the right vehicles, which is tougher in these illiquid asset classes. Then you have to educate and convince the gatekeepers essentially at the distributors.  And then you have to educate your entire sales force to be able to understand it. It is a different sale than say, a traditional mutual fund. And then you have to be part of educating financial advisers on why this particular product with its characteristics make sense in a portfolio. And unlike an institution, I always say that one of the things I think many of the -- alt providers who sold historically to institutional channels, if you just have this -- convince an institution why this fits in, a financial adviser has to understand every end clients' liquidity needs, which makes it really tough at the tip of the spear. The good news for us is we have very good product offerings now with all of our managers between -- BSP has multiple products with their BDCs and interval funds; Clarion, with their CPREIF and their Opportunity Zone.  We already -- K2 has quite a few products in the liquid alt space. We actually also have -- and the Lexington is now just getting launched on iCapital. So we've been able to get quite a few products now CAIS and iCapital, which is really important for the RIA channel so that they can handle the paperwork and the follow-up capital calls, which is one of the great pain points for advisers.  But when we look internally, it was clear to us that you couldn't have a wholesaler necessarily take it all the way to the end sale. And so we've created -- we've talked about it, it's been probably almost a -- it's probably been 6 months, it's kind of a joint venture between our alternatives teams and our distribution team, where we are hiring specialists to support the traditional distribution on the retail channel or the wealth channel to be able to drive that very end sale.  And we've been in a phase of doing a lot of hiring there. And I can tell you that we feel good about the traction we're getting. Adam, do you want to add anything more to that? Adam Spector : Well, yes, you took most of it, Jenny. But what I would say is that -- on top of that, this is a great example of where we're able to use our unique structure in terms of brand. So our alternative firms have great brands in the institutional are less known in the wealth channel. So we're still really putting the brands forward the BSP, the Lexington to Clarion in the institutional channel. But when we go to market in the wealth channels, we're going to the market at alternatives by Franklin Templeton. So that is really playing off of the brand name that resonates so well in those channels.  And again, it's another place where we're using our general specialist model so that where our salespeople, who have long-standing relationships and significant AUM in the wealth channel, they're going in as the lead, but they're introducing our alternative specialists, which we build out its over 35 people now, and those people are just focused on the wealth channel. The other thing I would add to that is that we've invested really heavily in education because we think that the first way to get growth in the channel is product development, having the right product in the right wrappers. Soon after that, it's building education. So advisers understand how to use these products. After that, it sales, and that's where we have the alternative specialists working with our field force in concert with each other. Matthew Nicholls : And I'll just add one other thing from a finance perspective for what it's worth, is this is not a short-term project or something like that. In turn, this is a very long-term, very strategic decision that we've made to invest in this separate group basically that's between 2 other major areas of the firm, that requires its own separate marketing, sales, product strategy, education, as Jenny mentioned. This is a very expensive endeavor that we've thought through very carefully and we justified it by the fact that we have acquired leading businesses in the alternative asset markets that we think long term are highly interesting and applicable to the broader markets.  But just as a reminder, we acquired these businesses because they had their own institutional growth and what we're talking about here on top of that is additional growth in the long term that we think we can capitalize upon. Adam Spector : And as a mark of progress, we are currently in market with Clarion, with BSP, with Lexington and our Venture Capital group, all of them in the wealth channel are actively raising assets. Craig Siegenthaler : I have a follow-up, and it's more of a CFO-type question for Matt. But I wanted to get a little more color on your alt-net flow definition in the $2.4 billion that you highlighted in the quarter. Is the inflow, the initial sale? Or is it when the fees actually turn on with the product? And then also, do you include realizations in the outflow? Or are they included in the market appreciation, other line of the AUM roll forward? Matthew Nicholls : No, the realizations are included in other markets. They're not particularly material for us, is why we do it that way. As we continue to expand our alternative asset business, we'll continue to review that. I don't actually know off the top of my head on the $2.4 billion of positive net inflow. What is fee paying, it's probably 80% of it, but we'll come back to you on that specifically. But I'm pretty sure it's like 80%, something like that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I wanted to have another question on fixed income and understanding or acknowledging your comments on Western and those funds still being on the gross sales side quite strong. But if I look at gross sales since you've owned the Legg Mason, this was the second lowest quarter for gross sales. So maybe talk about where you're seeing the traction in gross sales outside of maybe the Core and Core Plus. Jennifer Johnson : Are you speaking specifically just fixed income or equities as well, which... Daniel Fannon : Just fixed income, this was the second lowest gross sales number since you've owned Legg Mason. So we've already talked about Western. So I assume there's something else that may be having some slowdown. Adam Spector : Well, what I would say is that if you take a look at where the yield curve is right now and look at the shape of it and look how much you can make on the short end and it's a record quarter for us in cash management. So a lot of that really is just, I think, a temporary phenomenon where fixed income investors are able to park money on the short end, get a pretty attractive yield and wait for the right entry point. Jennifer Johnson : But munis -- we're getting good traction in munis. We have some in the SMA channel. We have some muni ladders that are very successful for us. I mean actually, from a diversification, 11 of our top 20 net inflows are outside our largest 20 funds. So it's actually a pretty broad diversification. And U.S. income, some of the multi assets have components in them, obviously, [ there's ] fixed income that are getting flows too. Daniel Fannon : Okay. And then just thinking about performance fees, I know obviously very hard to predict, but -- it seems like you are seeing redemptions in your liquid strategy. So maybe get a sense of kind of where performance sits broadly within the alternative universe and how we should, I guess, maybe performance-fee eligible AUM today versus a year ago, high watermarks, other kind of maybe numbers or things you can put around to give a sense of this year's outlook for performance fees maybe versus last year or other time periods? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Dan. So performance fees, as you know, as you just said, difficult to predict. But given the strong performance in related funds, and we do have strong performance I think -- literally, I mean, I think it's in 90% of our alternative asset funds are in the area where they're outperforming or in strong performance territory, let's say, in the performance fee zone. We expect to continue earning performance fees on a fairly consistent basis at this point. And that's why we've guided to $50 million per quarter, up from -- you may remember, several quarters ago, we used to guide $10 million to $25 million or something like that, but that's now up to $50 million per quarter, and we think that we can achieve that on a fairly consistent level.  There are, however, as you alluded to, there are some episodic characteristics within performance fees related to time and redemption-type activities. So for example, in the last quarter that we reported, I highlighted, I believe, on the call that we had a redemption that led to a $55 million additional performance fee for the quarter out of Clarion. So our guide is going to remain at $50 million. And all I'd say is that we have, based on our performance and our mix of assets and the time horizon with the funds, we have potential to exceed that as we continue to grow our alternative asset business.  But I'd certainly say forward-looking performance is looking strong, both in absolute and relative basis. We've expanded our alternatives significantly. It's the reason why we've guided higher to $50 million per quarter. But as you know, last year, we had $500 million in performance fees. So it shows what the potential is. But again, we think $50 million is the right guide for now, per quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : I just have one kind of broader philosophical question. You're obviously getting really good traction with your ETF suite and news flow kind of suggest that you've been more active converting mutual funds to ETFs than some others. Obviously, bond ETFs appear to be getting a lot more traction over the last year or so. So could you speak to your willingness to get more aggressive with ETF conversions for some of your more larger strategies? And what is the debate kind of for and against going down that road? Jennifer Johnson : So first of all, we're really proud of our ETF franchise. And the team that we have -- they're all very experienced. They were originally with BGI back then. And we've launched the suite and today in our -- I think at the end of the quarter, we announced it was about $13.3 billion in ETFs. We had -- 44% were active, 30% passive and 26% Smart Beta, and we were really one of the first multifactor Smart Beta managers.  In this quarter, even though on $13.3 billion in AUM, we had $1 billion in net sales. So clearly, one of the fastest growing. Of that $200 million was essentially a conversion from mutual funds. But the other $800 million came from actual sales in it globally. So U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia. So what we do is, we'll look at a strategy, and we consistently hear that distributors don't particularly want an ETF and a mutual fund to be exactly the same because that can cause suitability issues.  And so you have to be really careful about differentiating the ETF and the mutual fund. And in the case of the 2 that we converted, we thought they were really well-positioned funds but probably not getting traction in that channel. Many advisers sell just ETFs, so they won't sell a mutual fund. And so in order to get traction with those advisers, you actually have to have ETF. So we're always looking at our lineup and deciding whether or not it makes sense to do a conversion.  There's a little bit of complexities in doing a conversion because sometimes the existing fund holders may not be able to want to hold an ETF, and so you have to go through that process. But anywhere where we think there's well performing, but not getting traction, mutual fund, we will consider whether it should be converted into an ETF. Adam Spector : And the only add I would have to that is we have to look at who holds the mutual fund to the extent, for instance, that it has a large retirement or 401(k) holding that can sometimes make the conversion a little more complicated. As Jenny said, our ETF strategy, I think, is pretty differentiated with the 44% in active. It's also global. That's the other thing I would add.  So when we look at that $1 billion flow, about half of that came from outside of the U.S. And we're also willing to put differentiated asset classes like our infrastructure income into an ETF. I think that's a little different. And then the final piece I would add is that even when we're in passive, which is the minority of our ETFs, they're in niches where we think we can be highly cost competitive and differentiated like single country ETF. Matthew Nicholls : I think the other thing I'd add, and I think we put this into our prepared remarks. But it's not insignificant point that we've reorganized this group in ETFs to be more focused with their own sales effort embedded within the team. And it's similar, frankly, to what Jenny has reorganized around our multi-asset solutions area. These are the areas where we are heavily investing with resources and focus as opposed to them being part of a very large group that's attempting to do lots of different things. So -- and we're seeing some green shoots from that reorganization work and focus across the franchise. And I point out both multi-asset solutions and ETFs in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Brown from KBW. Michael Brown : So I wanted to ask on real estate. So with Clarion's just over $80 billion or $80 billion or so, there's clearly some challenges facing the industry. Can you just provide us with an update on what you're seeing from this asset class and how you think investor sentiment could progress from here? And then if possible, could you just touch on how much that contributes to performance fees and other revenue? Jennifer Johnson : Yes, I'll take the first part of that question. Matt, I'll have you touch on the performance fees. So remember, Clarion has primarily been an institutional manager. So it's only been recently that we've brought them into the wealth and retail channel. And so with respect to that, it's a very small -- CPREIF is a small fund that is growing quickly, and there's been minimal redemption requests there.  From the institutional side, first of all, Clarion's real estate portfolios have focused on industrial, multifamily, life sciences, self-storage, that's 85% of their portfolios and those have held up incredibly well. And as a matter of fact, I think their performance has only dropped about 1.5%. With respect to redemption queue, you have seen them move from positive queue to now negative requests. And in those -- they're not at least from the institutional clients, there's a real recognition that you don't want to hurt the value of the portfolio by creating false liquidity. And so they actually can choose whether or not they want to meet any of those redemption requests.  And on average, they target to try to meet about 10% of the redemption queue, and that's off at about 5% to 6% of a NAV per quarter. So it's very different than the issues that you have in the wealth channel. And again, they're really new to that wealth channel. CPREIF, I think, is structured very similar to BREIT as far as the kind of interval nature of this redemption. We think that's the right way to do it for that channel.  But again, their clients today are really primarily institutional clients. And sorry, the redemption queues mostly have been -- it has not been performance issues because they've done very, very well in performance. It's been the fact that other parts of the institutional clients' portfolios haven't performed well and they needed to rebalance because now they're overweighted on real estate.  Matt, do you want to touch on performance fees? Matthew Nicholls : Yes will do, thanks, Jenny. One very important correction, Jenny, sorry to [indiscernible] but one very important correction is that when Jenny mentioned about basically the 10% of the queue being paid out. That's not -- that doesn't translate into 5% to 6% of NAV per quarter. It's 5% to 6% of NAV per annum so [ that's ] for the year. I just want to make sure that's very clear.  Okay. And that's of their choice. Just to be clear, as Jenny also mentioned there isn't any forced liquidation in an industry like this where it wouldn't necessarily be the most productive for the portfolios or for the investors. So in terms of performance fees, frankly, Clarion is quite significantly above the threshold. So we would be surprised if we didn't see continued performance fees being paid on a meaningful portion of Clarion funds over the next year or plus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Matt, a question for you. I wanted to come back to expenses. So I hear you on a net basis that it's about 2% to 3% lower. I was hoping you might be able to elaborate on how you're able to achieve that? What would you say are the top 3 to 5 areas that are most meaningful in driving that decline. And do you view this as a 1-year efficiency drive? Or would you envision limited to declining expenses as you look out beyond this year? Matthew Nicholls : I think we certainly look at these expenses being structural expenses beyond the year. Obviously, there's always a portion of variable expenses that you expect to come down as a function of the market, and we're very disciplined around that. So it's almost a mix of those 2 things. But because we've been through a meaningful merger involving hundreds of millions of dollars of expense reductions and efficiencies, it basically forces you to look very carefully at all of the operation.  And look, we've doubled the size of our company from an assets under management perspective. We're much more diversified across the franchise. Our operation is, therefore, quite a bit more complicated. But at the same time, there's some interesting synergistic work that can be done to gain leverage from having that type of operational expertise across the franchise.  We also are very fortunate to have sense of excellence in Hyderabad, and in Poznan in Poland and we intend to further capitalize on the fact that we've been in those places for many, many years. It's not a new thing for us to have those centers of excellence. So we're very focused on that. It's really a combination of being obviously, in a difficult market being more disciplined around who do we really need to hire, who do we really need to replace when we have departures. It's executing upon the voluntary buyout and reducing layers in the organization and expanding and analyzing span and layers of control.  And it's the execution plan around our transactions where we've really been able to take more cost out than we anticipated. And a lot of that's gone to the margin and given us margin expansion opportunities on the upside, but also reasonable amount has gone into investing in the business. So we're always careful to balance getting the margin right and managing to keep investing in the business. We've also -- while we've done the largest outsourcing already on the operational side with fund administration and transfer agency, the other big project, for example, we're looking at across the firm now is our investment technology operation. And that's a really major one, multiyear project. And all of our specialist investment managers are on board with this. We believe that having a consistent system and [ vendor ] across the firm makes a ton of sense. We can have specialization still in the individual groups. But it's things like this that makes a material difference in how efficient we are, how effective we are and candidly, how we work together across the company. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO, for final comments. Jennifer Johnson : Okay. Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating in today's call. And once again would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Hello, my name is Lara, and I will be your call operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and at this time all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts or forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for the second fiscal quarter of 2023. As usual, I'm joined by Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. Despite a difficult market backdrop exacerbated by stress in the regional banking sector, we continue to see positive momentum across our business in terms of long-term flow trends, relative investment performance, diversification by product and vehicle and financial results. Market dislocations often result in investment opportunities for skilled active investors. And in this regard, our investment performance continued to improve across asset classes. This quarter, three of our four asset classes : fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, generated positive net flows. We also saw continued progress in ETFs and Canvas, our custom indexing solution platform. Flow trends improved across all geographies with our Asia Pacific region reporting positive long-term net flows in the quarter. Furthermore, this prolonged period of heightened market volatility affirms the importance of the investments we've made to diversify our business and better serve our clients, all in an effort to offer more choice and help them achieve long-term financial goals no matter where we are in the economic cycle. As to the specific numbers, starting first with flows, long-term net outflows improved from the prior quarter to $3.7 billion compared to net outflows of $10.9 billion in the prior quarter. Importantly, as mentioned, fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives all generated positive net flows. Fixed income generated net inflows of $1.8 billion. And as we've said on previous calls, we continue to benefit from our broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies and that trend continued this quarter. Client interest continued in U.S. taxable corporate, municipal and global opportunistic strategies, which were all net flow positive. Multi-asset net inflows were $1.5 billion, driven by Franklin Income Fund, Fiduciary Trust International's high net worth business and Canvas. Canvas has achieved net inflows each quarter since the platform launched in September 2019 and AUM increased over 13% in the quarter. Alternative net inflows were $1.3 billion, driven by growth into private market strategies, which were partially offset by outflows in liquid alternative strategies. Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington Partners each had net inflows with a combined total of $1.5 billion. Equity net outflows were $8.3 billion, reflecting continued risk-off sentiment for many investors, but we did see positive net flows into ETFs, Global equity and Small Cap Growth equity strategies. ETFs had net inflows of $1 billion and now total approximately $15 billion in AUM. In this quarter, we launched a variant of our flagship Franklin Income Fund in a multi-asset active ETF vehicle. Cash management, which is excluded from long-term AUM and flows had net outflows of $4.3 billion in the quarter and included episodic redemptions of approximately $7.5 billion from a sweep program associated with the regional bank. Our regionally focused sales model has continued to gain traction, and this quarter, we experienced improving flow trends across all geographies. I already mentioned the positive long-term net flows in the Asia Pacific region, which were driven by Australia, Korea and Japan. Our one, but not funded, institutional pipeline was $15.4 billion and reflected the previously disclosed funding of a $7.5 billion institutional fixed income mandate. Given the uncertain market environment, institutional investors continue to be more defensive with a focus on diversification and liquidity. This resulted in less money in motion, particularly in March. Turning now to investment performance. In this environment in particular, it's encouraging to see that the sound long-term investment thesis of many of our largest strategies are playing out and performance generally improved across all time periods. This quarter, 64%, 63%, 61% and 66% of our strategy composite AUM outperformed their respective benchmarks on a one, three, five and 10-year basis. The one-year period improved primarily due to certain ClearBridge and Franklin Mutual Series equity strategies. Additionally, we're seeing improvement in the longer-term performance of Western Asset's U.S. taxable fixed income strategies. On the mutual fund side, 67%, 53%, 63%, and 56% of our AUM outperformed their peers on a one, three, five and 10-year basis. Equity-related products are leading the increase in relative performance for the one-year period, specifically, ClearBridge, Templeton Global Equity Group and Franklin Equity Group outperformed in March. In addition, half of mutual fund AUM was in funds rated 4 or 5 star by Morningstar. As I mentioned earlier, over the past several years, we have further diversified our business, and we believe our broad range of investment philosophies and processes differentiate our specialist investment managers from each other and gives us an ability to build the best outcomes for our clients. In March, we proactively engaged with clients to help them navigate financial uncertainty created by stress in the regional banking sector. The Franklin Templeton Institute provided timely updates to our clients through webinars, articles and video posts. Clients were particularly interested in the numerous panels comprised of our specialist investment managers who offered investment perspectives across asset classes, including venture capital, alternative credit and traditional fixed income. We continue to see client demand in fixed income, income-oriented and dividend-yielding products. In addition, as a result of recent market dislocations, alternative capabilities such as secondary private equity, private credit and real estate continue to be of client interest. Touching briefly on our financial results, ending AUM was $1.42 trillion, an increase of 2.5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to market appreciation and average AUM increased 5% to $1.4 trillion from the prior quarter. While this quarter's adjusted effective fee rate was in line with prior quarter at 39 basis points, adjusted operating revenues of $1.5 billion increased 6% from the prior quarter driven by higher adjusted performance fees and average AUM, partially offset by two fewer calendar days. Adjusted operating income was $440.2 million, an 11% increase from the prior quarter, and our adjusted operating margin increased to 28.9% compared to 27.5% in the prior quarter. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with total cash and investments of $6.8 billion. Let me wrap up by summarizing that we continue to benefit from our diversified business, our flows and relative investment performance have been steadily improving, and our balance sheet affords us flexibility, including the ability to further expand our capabilities. Our focus remains on delivering better outcomes for our clients. And finally, my admiration and thanks go to the thousands of employees around the globe who represent Franklin Templeton so well. Now let's turn over to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate all the extra color in the supplement. Maybe, Jenny, one for you. You sort of mentioned that in your prepared comments and also in the press release that you're sort of positioned to take advantage of some structural growth. I was wondering if you could break that down between, maybe, organic opportunities where you sort of see the best incremental flows from here and maybe where things are on the inorganic side? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Yes. So I mean, I think that from the organic side, all flows aren't created equal, right? So anything in the alternatives, which continues to be positive for us, tends to have much higher fee rate and margin. And we think we have absolutely outstanding managers in that space and have continued to see positive flows there. Fixed income today, six out of our 10 top growth strategies or fixed income, three of those are Western. So while Western had had some performance challenges, they're -- actually, their six-month numbers are top decile and they're now very strong. I think one is in 3 and five and one is in three, five and 10 in Core Bond and Core Bond Plus. We think there's a secular trend with things like SMA and Canvas, we think, is the best technology out there. We've now launched not only are we consistently gaining flows on the direct indexing side, but we've actually launched some -- or seeded some active strategies leveraging the Canvas platform. So you can imagine you take some of your traditional mutual fund type strategies and be able to launch them with tax efficiency, leveraging the campus technology. And then I'd say on the ETFs, we - I've been waiting for the hockey stick. I'm hopeful that we're getting there, the $1 billion inflows, it's a strong organic growth rate. The largest percentage of our ETFs is actually active. I think that's about 40% of our ETFs. The flows this quarter were primarily smart beta and passive, but almost 900 -- or over $900 million of that came from the U.S. RIA channel, which is a pretty new channel for us. So we think we're just starting to tap into that space. And then I would say, multi-asset solutions. We've gained some big wins there that are coming in actually in this current quarter, and we think that there's going to be continued opportunities. So I think that gives you kind of a picture on the organic side. What we've always said on the M&A side is, look, we're going to focus on areas where we have product gaps from the alt space. The only place that we think we'd have a real big product gap is infrastructure, but they're hard to buy and very expensive and that anything else on the traditional side would have to include strong distribution capabilities. We're looking to continue to expand distribution. Obviously, the place everybody loves is retirement because retirement is consistent flows. And honestly, it's the best place for mutual funds today. So anything we do there would have to have some sort of distribution capability. And then finally, I mentioned that we've always been a buyer of local asset management because any country that you go into, 80% of flows tend to go to local assets. So we always keep our eyes open, particularly in fast-growing countries. Matt Nicholls : And just to add, Bill, to what Jenny just mentioned, I think we should make clear that our number one priority is organic growth, as Jenny just mentioned, all those things. But in certain situations, it simply takes either too long or is frankly impossible, to become a leader in an investment category via organic growth. And that's why we've done what we've done with Lexington, BSP, Alcentra, Clarion and Canvas, and there's obviously others in there. But that's the reason why we've done the M&A that we've done, we concluded it's just too hard to get there maybe even impossible, frankly, on an organic level. Bill Katz : That's helpful, Matt. And just maybe one for you as a follow-up. Last quarter, you kind of gave some guidance on both performance fees and expenses and a fair amount of variability on what actually layered through. So I was wondering if you could maybe unpack the big performance for this quarter and then how you sort of see some of the expense lines into the new quarter? Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Yes. Jenny Johnson : Matt, do you want to take that? Matt Nicholls : Yes, I'll take that, Jenny. So firstly, on the expenses relative to the guide that we gave last quarter, as hopefully you saw from a G&A occupancy in IST, we were very much in line also EFR slightly higher so that was in line. It really came down to comp and benefits being about $50 million higher than we had guided, and that's driven by three key things. Fortunately, all of these were driven mostly by better performance. So one, was $30 million increase in performance fee compensation; two, about $10 million was higher resets to 401(k) plan, other sort of seasonal compensation related matters; and then another $10 million was just a formulaic approach we have to compensation of which performance of funds are a very important aspect of that formula. So that increased by $10 million. That basically explains the difference between where we guided versus where we came out. In terms of where we expect next quarter, we continue to guide the effective fee rate around 39 basis points. So consistent with this quarter. Excluding performance fees, just to be clear, from a comp and benefits perspective, assuming we have a performance fee quarter of $50 million, which will continue to be our guide on performance fees, we'd expect comp benefits to be at 7.25 area and IS&T we'd expect to remain approximately flat at around $120 million, occupancy in the high 50s, again, approximately flat in G&A, probably in the mid-140s, down from the mid-high 40 guide that we gave last quarter and that does include an assumption of continued higher T&E and slightly higher placement fees. In terms of just performance fees, I know we get this question and it's very hard to guide on performance fees, as we've talked about in previous quarters. Given the strong performance in applicable funds, we expect to continue earning performance fees and that to be quite consistent, but we're going to keep our guide of $50 million. There are, obviously, episodic characteristics with performance fees related to both time of investment and redemption activity. In this quarter, for example, we just had another group of customers that hit the five-year performance threshold that triggered the performance fee -- and increased performance fee out of Clarion for this quarter, which meant that we came in higher than we had anticipated, but that's how we've guided on performance fees. Bill Katz : Thank you, both. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just circle back to the OnChain money fund announcement that we saw recently. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your vision there, the opportunity set that you see with this OnChain money fund product? And how you might think about broadening out distribution over time beyond the Benji app to distribute more broadly than that? And I guess, do you also view this as a replacement for stable clients? Just curious how you think about that. Jenny Johnson : Okay. So a couple of things. So our OnChain money fund, we worked with the SEC -- gosh, it's been a few years now since we started -- a couple of year process. Ultimately, we built a transfer agency system as well as hot and cold storage wallet to support the OnChain money market fund. We -- with everything that happened in the regional banking sector, we actually have started to get some flows there as some of these Dow's or platforms -- the blockchain platforms, we're interested in and needed to move money away from, say, Silicon Valley Bank and other places, and then felt that we sort of consistently philosophically, they like the idea of doing the blockchain money market fund. Our big announcement this week is that we added what's called cross chain. So for those who don't know much about the crypto space. Think about your iPhone and your Android, iOS. They don't -- the applications don't tend to talk to each other. You have the same problem in the blockchain space. And so when we added Polygon to it, that's a layer two over Ethereum. So that meant businesses that built on the Polygon, which is a lot, now have access to our money market funds. So we're sort of initially positioning it in that space, although we think over time, there's a lot of efficiencies in back office that will come out of blockchain. And we absolutely can see adding other products as well as a global Benji product. Michael Cyprys : And just as a follow-up question. It sounds like the overall fee rate guidance, pretty stable, has been stable for a bit. But just big picture, maybe you could talk a little bit about your overall multiyear outlook for pricing across products on your platform. If you look back over the past couple of years, where would you say pricing has moved the most versus maybe what's held in? What surprised you as you look back? And as you look forward, where do you anticipate the most stable versus more movement in pricing as you look out over the next couple of years? JennyJohnson: Adam, do you want to take that because you're seeing it on the distribution side? Adam Spector : Sure. So I think where we've seen the pricing move the most is in the traditional large asset classes, fixed income, equity, especially U.S. and fixed income. Those have ground down to a point. But I think they've hopefully hit a bottom here. We also see mandates coming in generally at larger sizes, which has obviously a significant impact on fees. And as we see consolidation in the industry, among players, that's impacting things. We think that when our fee rate moves, it tends to be a factor of asset mix as opposed to see degradation really because we're really able to earn significantly more on our alternative assets. And when you see the rates move around, that's less our rates degrading and more a shift in the mix. Matt Nicholls : But Mike, just longer term, just to add to that, though, what we would expect, and this has been part of our strategy, as you know, is to try and mitigate the -- any pressure we have in the traditional asset management space around fees and winning, hopefully, larger mandates that have lower fees in traditional asset management space to supplement that with a growing alternative asset base that tends to be characterized with higher performance fees. So far, that strategy has been playing out quite well for us in the sense of our overall effective fee rates stayed relatively stable and even to the upside. And if we continue with the strategy that we have, adding where we expect winning certain mandates where we expect from the traditional side, we do have a chance over the next several years for the far to creep up. But again, as you know, it's highly dependent on what happens in the equity markets, in particular, were as Adam just mentioned, it's all about mix of the equity markets go higher and we continue on the path that we're on around building our alternative asset business. And if that's higher and broader fixed income is a little bit lower, for example, it stays flat, then the fee rate will be higher. If it's the other way around, the fee rate will likely be a little bit lower. But again, we've got good hedges in the system for that, that designed to keep the effective fee rate as stable as possible. Jenny Johnson : I mean -- and I would -- there's $16.5 trillion in the fixed income space. Finally, people can allocate to fixed income and actually get a return. You could have one-third of your pension fund in fixed income and still hit your 7% target. So honestly, we hope we see a lot more flows there. We've had some hiccups in performance, but that's working its way out. And so we'd love to see a lot bigger flows in the fixed income, which could affect it. We just happen to have a great offset with both a strong active equity franchise and the alternatives that we're doing. Michael Cyprys : Super. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. DanFannon: Thanks. Good morning. So wanted to follow up on just the alternatives outlook. Specifically, a clarification on Clarion. I think that you said the five-year lockup for performance fees. So wondering if that -- so that was not a redemption, which we saw last year, which triggered a performance piece. I just want to clarify that. And then just talk about the ins and outs at Clarion today and how you see that prospectively looking and then also maybe more broadly within the context of BSP and Lexington, I know you can't talk specifically about funds in the market, but generally just demand and the fundraising outlook. Jenny Johnson : So I'll start. And Adam, you and Matt can add. So with Clarion, the bulk of the performance fees were actually their normal process of when you -- when clients hit a five-year window, you then monetize the performance fee. And so that -- the bulk of that was that as opposed to just redemptions from clients. They have gone from an internal queue to now a redemption queue. Clarion is different in that they are not required to redeem like others, maybe required 5% a quarter, Clarion has a choice because there and the institutional clients prefer this, they weigh the client's liquidity versus making sure that they're preserving value in the fund. And so they meet about 10% of the redemption queue, which I think is annually, it's 5% to 6% of the NAV. It's important to remember that Clarion has very little exposure to office, which has been the biggest area of pressure in the real estate space. And they have been big in industrial and residential. And so their performance is held up, so we think as interest rates come in the market, we probably -- we feel like there'll be one more raise and then probably sit there that folks will feel comfortable with the values in real estate and you'll start to see that flip. As far as all of the alts business, there's a denominator effect with the LPs, right? They've had a reduction in all their liquid assets. And to the extent that they'd like to deploy them, they're actually finding themselves over allocated in the alt space. So it's been harder on the fundraising side. I mean take private credit. Our BSP would tell you that they're seeing the best deals they've seen since the global financial crisis. But there's definitely some headwinds in raising money, just because of the fact that the LPs are fully an over allocation to it. Now we've been -- Lexington set out to raise a $15 billion fund. They are -- the LPs have allowed them to extend it, and they will raise above that. And actually, I'd love to just point out that in the case of Lexington, we believe 10% of that fund will come from the wealth channel. We launched a product with a large partner, and they said you should be happy with the first fund at about $500 million, and we think that fund will cap out at the cap. We extended it to $1 billion. So kind of overall space is that the LPs are finding themselves overallocated because the markets -- their liquid assets have been down. But as the equity markets improved, you're actually starting to see them being able to deploy more capital. The other thing that's happened is normal cash flows that come out of things like private equity are down quite a bit, so they haven't been able to fund from their existing alternatives. So it's just put them in a tougher spot, but they also recognize it's just a tremendous opportunity right now. Matt, I can see you'd love to say something. Matt Nicholls : Yes. I mean in terms of the performance fee composition, just to give you some idea and to address your question specifically around Clarion in a second. So out of the performance fee, about 60% of proceeds related to quarterly fees, about 10% realizations, about 20% annual. In terms of the five-year threshold point I know you know this, but just to be -- just to state the obvious, that obviously, the whole client base isn't on one, five year term. There's hundreds of customers that have invested at different points of time. So there's different five year thresholds that occur all the time. So every quarter, there can be another group of five year threshold to the net, which leads to the -- which leads to the performance fee threshold being met. And of course, some of those are different than five years. Sometimes you can have different performance thresholds based on different time lines. We just called out the five year this time because it happens to be a larger portion of the performance we pay out. Adam Spector : The final thing I would add on Clarion is that traditionally, they really have been focused on the institutional market, but we're starting to see much better flows out of the wealth channel now. CP Reef is now up on 20 different platforms. We're seeing good growth there. Their opportunity zone fund is doing well. BSP is doing well. Jenny spoke about Lexington, so the specialized unit we built in the alternative channel is finally coming online and producing really good results in the wealth channel. DanFannon: Great. Thanks for answering my questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Good to hear and see further commentary about the build-out of the wealth management alternatives distribution efforts. So curious and also, thanks, Jenny, for the color about the contributions to Fund 1 at Lexington. You'd flagged that in the write-up, so that makes a lot of sense. Have you -- what's the feedback that you're getting on the team that you put out there? And then when you're thinking about benchmarking that effort against competitors that have seen success, how has that process gone? And how much work is there continuing to add to those efforts? Thanks. Jenny Johnson : I'll let Adam take that since it's his team. Adam Spector : Yes. Well, then you know what the answer is going to be, Jenny. So we're feeling really good about the results we've had out there. And all I would say is that when we're in the system, we're getting indications of where they think we should be, and we're exceeding those expectations pretty handily. So we're feeling really good about the results. I think the results are driven by a few things. We have a great combination of a strong brand name of great investment capability and a specialized distribution force. Those three things have come together in the wealth channel in a way that I don't think other firms can act. We are seeing growth not only in the wires, but in a number of the independent and regionals as well. Our next effort here is to really take that alternative specialized approach and build out both the product set and the sales team outside of the U.S. to tap into wealth channels outside of the U.S., and that's the process we're in right now. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that. And I know you touched on this a little bit before as far as the outlook for Western and flows. But when you look at the unfunded mandates and unfunded pipeline, would you say that there's an orientation to fixed income there? How does the balance look? And then how active are the RFPs, however active are you on the RFP for bonds? Thanks. Adam Spector : Very active on RFPs for bonds. The good news is where we're seeing the activity is really across the board from high-grade credit mandates to high yield to private credit to core to global, global opportunistic. So in all the categories, we're seeing really good growth. When it comes to fixed income, crazy that we have 127 composites, but 42 of those are outperforming on the one, three, five, and 10. And what that means is that we're able to compete in most sectors of fixed income quite well. The pipeline is diversified by asset class at this point. It's not really dominated by fixed income. And in fact, the most significant portion of it currently, I believe, is from our solutions business, which is really coming on quite nicely. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, Jenny and Matt, hope you're both doing well. Sticking with the last topic of fixed in rebalancing, given your competitive and leading offerings in traditional fixed income, we wanted to get your perspective on the potential for large rebalancing into bonds, especially now that it looks like we're nearing the end of the Fed's rate hiking cycle. And also, do you have any perspective on the potential inflow mix between active work you're more competitive and then pass it? Jenny Johnson : Look, I would say -- what we've seen on the institutional side is that the institutions have been staying conservative. We're waiting for this last, probably, Fed rate increase staying short duration and pretty high quality, but we're starting to see searches in more of a risk on. So that tells you that they're one, getting more comfortable with would be the economic backdrop and two, that they're starting to feel like we're at the peak of the curve. We're -- we think this is just going to be a massive opportunity on the fixed income side once people get comfortable that the Fed stops hiking. And I think my view is the Fed will raise and will sit through 2023, probably not have a decrease, but in that people will try to lock in those higher rates. I don't -- Adam, give a sense, passive versus active. Adam Spector : Not necessarily a huge change in that mix. All I would say is that to the extent that we have continued volatility in rates for a little bit here, active management tends to do a little better in a situation where you have more movement. We certainly see that across the curve. And so we're seeing really good flows into active. Jenny Johnson : It's an important time to be active in the fixed income space. This is not a great time to be passive in it. But that's just my view. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Jenny. And then just as my follow-up, we saw positive net inflows into APAC. Can you comment on what products and which geographies are driving the inflows. Adam Spector : Sure. Asia was really our strongest market in terms of net. What we've done there really is focused on a few themes. And I think -- we were early in that region in aligning our marketing product and sales all around certain themes and income has been something that's really been winning for us there. Our oldest fund is the income fund coming up on its 75th anniversary at over $80 billion in its various forms, and that's been doing particularly well in Asia. But we've also had big institutional wins in fixed income and equity and alternatives. So it's really been all of the asset classes. I think our Asian colleagues, if you take a look at Australia as an example, that was one of the first markets where we implemented this generalist specialist model where the local sales team is responsible for knowing the client really better than anyone else and then bringing in other members of the Franklin Templeton team. Given the geography there, that was one of the first places we started, and we've seen earlier results that have pronounced 30 months in a row positive net flow in Australia in retail. So Asia has been strong. If you see gross flows though, obviously, the U.S. is dominating there. That's our biggest market by far at about 72%. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. Thank you, Adam. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe just to stay on the fixed income topic for a second. I hear your point on active versus passive, but year-to-date, fixed income ETFs have overwhelmed the gain share versus active products. So is that largely a retail dynamic? Or what you're referring to is largely on the institutional side? Or are you starting to see maybe some improvement in active appetite. And curious how your private credit offering fits in within all of that, right? Because on the one hand, if traditional fixed income strategies continue to get squeezed, you guys have an opportunity to cross-sell into some of the old managers. So how are those kind of separate managers working together to sort of tackle the client from both sides? Jenny Johnson : So I'll take the second part of that question, and Adam, I'll leave the past of it active to you. Honestly, on the private credit side, as I mentioned, the BSP folks would say that they're seeing the best deals since the global financial crisis, but this denominator effect is an issue with the LPs. But the other side of this is -- why are they seeing those deals? They're seeing those deals because banks are just not wanting to lend. And while you can look at structured products and syndicated products and say, well, those are off the bank's balance sheet. The bank still has to retain a portion of that equity. And so you're just -- traditionally, it was about 50-50 kind of syndicated in private credit. And I think our private credit team would say that they're going to see more coming to private credit and less banks stepping in. So I think that changes the dynamic a bit. Having said that, they'll tell you one of the headwinds is you can get secondary, you could buy a bond out in the liquid market and get a 9% return in a high yield. And so that is a headwind for the private credit today because there isn't as much differentiation between the returns on the private credit side on the existing portfolios as there is in the liquid market. So I think that's going to be a headwind for a little while. On the other hand, as you're seeing banks lend less and these guys get to be more -- as long as you have a good origination machine in your private credit manager you're going to get the very good deals, and you're not going to have as much competition. So that's why we're very bullish on it despite a little bit of headwinds today. Adam? Adam Spector : I would also say that it's tough to predict, active versus passive. I don't know that we have special insight into that, but we do have insight into demand for active. And there's a tremendous amount, and there's plenty for us and that's really across the different asset classes. High yield, we've seen turn around quite nicely. If you get a weakening dollar here, we think our global strategies can do well. We have pension plans that are better funded now and we have specific strategies designed to help to feed those liabilities. Those are all active. So we're seeing demand really across every single bit of our active portfolio. And if you look at traditional performance, Western had a rough go of it, they're tough decile now over the last six months. And after a fall like this, that's typically when they generate their greatest alpha given that they're a slightly higher beta manager. So this is probably the best type of environment for them right now. So don't know about passive, but feeling pretty good about the opportunities for active. Alex Blostein : And for my follow-up, maybe asking a question on the Alt business. You guys have strategically tried to build that out over the last couple of years. If we look at AUM, it's been sort of flattish over the last couple of quarters, and I know AUM doesn't tell the full picture. So maybe help us break down what the management fee is associated with the private or the old book for you guys today. And how do you see that growing over the next, call it, 12 months based on things where you sort of see a line of sight, whether it's deploying capital on things that have already been raised that will begin earning fees undeployed or sort of funds that you have coming online over the next couple of quarters? Jenny Johnson : Matt, do you want to take that. Matt Nicholls : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jenny. So maybe just to take a bit of a step back and review where we've come from to, Alex, to think that's important. Our alternative asset management fee screen, let's call it, increase from 2021 to 2022 by 50%. From 2022 to 2023, we expect it to increase by another 30%. Just over 80% of the AUM is the generating AUM and that creates sort of a mid- -- sort of high 50s, mid-50s EFR. But obviously, the range is very significant. So we've got very different businesses within that 80% fee earning AUM. That as a whole, means that our management fee revenue from alternative assets this quarter reached 25% of our overall business. Now obviously, that's a function of the traditional business shrinking a little bit, the market is coming down there and the market is being more stable in alternative assets. But it's getting very close to our one-third, let's call it, target that we expected to have in terms of management fee revenue. If you have performance fees to that, you go from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of management fee revenue and you know what our performance fees were last year, we had a few hundred million dollars of that this year. We're getting to the high $1 billion in terms of contribution in revenues. I think that we see a future where that outside of additional potential acquisitions, where that should grow at an organic growth rate of between 5% and 10%. And it would be great if it was 10% or higher, but we're just being conservative in the 5% to 10% area. It has actually grown organically by 5% to 10% in terms of what we've acquired. The area of shrinkage that we've experienced in the alternative asset AUM, Alex, I think you're referring to is all on the -- all on the liquid side of the business. We have a couple of fairly sizable strategies there that had some performance issues earlier on this year and late last year and that led to outflows there. But I'd just say, overall, we are very much on target in terms of what we expect, the alternative asset contribution to be against the overall business, number one. Number two, where we expect the EFR to be and how that helps us hedge the traditional asset management business, performance fees to be and where the overall business mix is and what's fee generating what's not fee generating. Alex Blostein : Great. Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Matt Nicholls : Thanks Alex. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. KenWorthington: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. First on gross inflows into equity funds or the equity business. The gross inflows were soft this quarter. You highlighted some of the areas that are working quite well, ETFs global small cap. What parts of the business are struggling most here? Where was sort of the delta that you saw this quarter versus last quarter. Like clearly, you mentioned the risk off environment, but where are you seeing the incremental pain today versus what you saw in prior quarters? Adam Spector : Yes. So first thing, equities was our softest asset class, but I would note that if you take a look at our flows ex dividend, they were actually up quarter-over-quarter, and our redemptions were down. So some bright news behind the negative net. If you take a look at the numbers behind that, large-cap growth was the area of the equity market that was hit hardest with negative flows over the last several quarters, and it's a large and it's area where we have the most significant asset base. So we are roughly balanced. We have slightly more AUM and growth versus value, but in large cap growth, we have a number of funds, that area with hit hard, where we see growth is actually in some of the smaller areas like international and small cap where we actually had some positive flows. The truth is that those positive flows are in asset classes that have a smaller slice of the pie, which helped lead to the negative flows overall. KenWorthington: Okay. Thank you. And then it was a big quarter for money market funds helped by the stress in the banking sector in March. To what extent is Franklin and Western benefiting from this transition from banks to money funds. And how is Franklin's cash management business broadly positioned if and as more money comes out of the banks in the future? And then I guess, lastly, you mentioned the one-off outflow as part of a sweep program. Are there more outflows to come from that program? Or is it sort of like one and done? Jenny Johnson : There could be a couple of billion more potential outflows in that just because they're still in that regional bank. But otherwise, the bulk of it has already passed through. So now it's about positioning our money markets, and obviously, Western's a behemoth in the space. So we are very well positioned for it. KenWorthington: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. So I guess you referred to the solutions orientation a few times. I just want to circle back. My feeling is Legg was a work in progress before Franklin -- was a work in progress trying to deliver the franchise because of the multi-asset -- multi-boutique nature of it. I think Franklin was better at it, and then you're in the process of motioning them together. You add in a bunch of private markets. So my question is, where do you think you're at in terms of being able to deliver large multi-asset mandates and is that something you're working on? And should we expect to see in the future? Thanks Matt. Jenny Johnson : So that is, as I mentioned, I think that's one of our areas that we think is a big opportunity of growth. And again, our roots with the flagship Franklin Income Fund and being around for 75 years. We think we're pretty good at it. So it's been an area of big focus. And actually, in April, we have a couple of wins in the multi-asset space that came from our solutions group. So right now, I don't think we have consistent quarterly flows there, but we're starting to get -- there's a strong pipeline and we're starting to get more consistent flows in the space. And I would say that -- and Adam could probably speak to it since he was CEO of Brandywine at the time. But the difference between what Legg was trying to pull together were that the sims didn't even talk to each other, let alone the parent is much, whereas today, I think there's just a much greater just the sims willing to work with each other and come up with ideas. I mean discussions between Western and benefits on Benefit Street Partners on joining private credit and liquid credit, our local asset management team that managed [indiscernible] fixed income reaching out to Benefit Street Partners and doing a [indiscernible] private credit product. So I just think that there's \u2013 one is they're coming out of not only the multi-asset solutions group who's working with them. But also we're actually finding the investment teams, the various SIMs are coming up with ideas to work with each other. Adam Spector : Absolutely. And I think the other nice thing about this solutions business is that we're strong on the institutional side with large platforms, insurance companies, et cetera. But the other nice thing is that we're using our technology space through our goals optimization engine. We're actually able to take asset allocation solutions orientation to the wealth channel, and we're seeing a pretty significant pickup there. So it's really solutions across the board from wealth to institutional. Glenn Schorr : Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. I just -- if I can ask a two-parter in fixed income. And that is maybe switching to the retail public side. If you can characterize how you're seeing demand for in the classic Franklin taxable bond franchise, also the global franchise as well, considering, obviously, we have much higher rates and the comments you made earlier on the stability of rates. And then the second part would be on the Western side, if -- again, it's good that we're moving into a higher rate back drop that's more sustained, that's more sort of plateauing potentially, and you sound very excited about institutional mandates picking up. I guess, how would that fare or how do you see any kind of risk to future flows if we move into a credit cycle in the later part of the year in, say, a recession scenario? And that would be more for the Western set. Jenny Johnson : Well, as I mentioned, six of our top 10 grossing strategies are all fixed income, and that's a mix of both Franklin, Brandywine and Western. So -- and as we've talked about in prior calls, there's very little correlation between how Brandywine's excess returns are to Western and frankly, it's nice that we really come at it from a diversified portfolio of investment teams. I'll let Adam talk about kind of the flow thing. I would just comment on the credit cycle. That is where active management makes all the difference. And so honestly, as we -- if we move into kind of a deeper recessionary environment as opposed to a lighter recessionary environment, it's going to make all the difference that you had an active approach to your portfolio in fixed income. Adam, do you want to add to the flow. Adam Spector : Yes. When we talk about the traditional Franklin side of things as well in addition to Western, our global macro performance has turned around. That's an area where we're seeing the story, which is positive. And let's not forget our Munis business, which is something like $76 billion. We're seeing strong growth there placement on more systems. So I think both of those as well as Western, Brandywine and then the private credit thing, all of those are going to go well. The truth is that you can now actually meet your return assumptions with the significant portion of your assets allocated to bonds. That is the strongest tailwind we could hope for share fixed-income. Brian Bedell : And just, I guess where are you seeing the redemptions on the retail fixed income side coming from? Is there any areas that are still sort of pressure? Adam Spector : Look, I would say that the two biggest fixed income are core and core plus, they tend to be the drivers of gross sales as well as the drivers of redemption just based on the share side. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We have a last question coming from the line of Finian O'Shea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Finian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A question on Alcentra. Can you talk about the progress on integration into Benefit Street, if that is complete in your mind? And then on the product and distribution side for that platform? Any color you can provide from early discussions with LPs on their receptivity to do more given its greater scale in capital and origination? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Yes. So the leadership that BSP is driving the really -- to the extent that there's integration, the integration with Alcentra. And we've now gone out and won. First thing you do is you make sure that you retain your key employees. And so we feel like we've stabilized the team there. We've met with all of their key clients. And so that's both the BSP folks move on with the central folks and meeting with the key clients. So we actually we feel really good about. That first step and making sort of stabilization. I can tell you that our distribution team in Europe is very excited to have a private credit manager to be able to distribute, that is local European private credit, but again, the private credit market faces a little bit of the headwinds that we talked about that BSP has faced. So there's -- in April, we have good CLO progress. And I think Alcentra is 49% of our CLOs. So we're still -- we feel good about that. I think though that we -- the fact that they're stable and now moving forward is I think is where we hope they'd be at this point, and I think that's where they are. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to - Matt Nicholls : I'm sorry. We have one other question that came through on the screen without answer. Can everybody hear me? Jenny Johnson : Yes. Matt Nicholls : Okay, great. So we had a question that was a follow-up on the guidance, quarterly guidance. And the question was, how does that impact our annual guidance. We gave an annual guidance range last quarter of $3.95 billion to $4 billion of adjusted expenses, annual adjusted expenses. And I'll just say, obviously, we're only halfway through the year, but all else remaining equal, despite improved market levels, improved flows, improved performance which push out formulary compensation, as I referenced on the question from Bill Katz. We're only slightly increasing the upper end of our guidance range to $4.05 million billion. So the guide would be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion for the year. And right now, we expect to be on the upper end of that range, excluding performance fees. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Jenny Johnson, Franklin President and CEO, for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Great. Well, everybody, thank you for participating in today's call. And once again, we'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you so much, presenters. And thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin\u2019s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton\u2019s results for the third fiscal quarter of 2023. As usual, I\u2019m joined by Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. Over the past server years we have been intentional in building a diversified company that offers a broad range of investment expertise and capabilities across asset classes. Investment vehicles and geographies to benefit a broad range of clients through various market conditions and cycles. We believe our corporate model of preserving the investment economy of each of our specialist investment managers combined with the resources of a global firm meets the demands of our diverse client base and produces strong long-term results. This quarter, long-term net flows turned positive. Investment performance remains strong and adjusted operating income improved by 8%. Financial markets in general stage rebalance in the first half of the calendar year. The S&P 500 Indexes concentration in five companies is at its most extreme level in more than 30 years. A challenge for those seeking to outperform the index while managing for concentration risk in their equity portfolios, but also an opportunity for skilled and disciplined active managers with a long-term horizon. Client focus has always been a hallmark of Franklin Templeton and we\u2019ve been actively engaging with our clients to assist them in navigating this complex environment. As our industry and client preferences continue to evolve, there is strong demand for asset managers to have a full range of investment options that span geographical regions, both in public and private market strategies. We generated the interest in our alternative and multi-asset strategies in particular, which both saw positive net flows during the quarter. In addition, we experienced strong flows in ETFs, SMAs and the high network channel, and flow trends continue to improve across all geographies benefiting from our regional sales model and strategy. Our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions both reported positive long-term net flows. That\u2019s the second consecutive quarter of net inflows for Asia Pacific. While we\u2019re always focused on organic priorities, we have previously stated our interest in distribution-led strategic transactions that would further diversify our business and accelerate growth in key markets. With the vision of offering more choice to more clients and important sectors, we will please to announce the establishment of a long-term partnership with the Power Corporation of Canada and Great-West Life Code this quarter. As part of the relationship, we will acquire Putnam Investments, which managed $136 billion in AUM as of April 30, 2023, from Great-West for approximately $925 million primarily funded with equity. Great-West will make an initial incremental asset allocation of 25 billion to our specialist investment managers within 12 months of closing with that amount expected to increase over the next several years. Great-West will also become a long-term shareholder in Franklin Resources. And of the equity issued to Great-West, shares representing 4.9% of our common stock are subject to a five-year lock-up. This is a compelling transaction for both firms and we\u2019re looking forward to actively partnering to develop additional opportunities that will be realized over time. The agreement aligns with our focus to further grow insurance clients assets and expands the existing relationship between Franklin Templeton and the power group of companies in the key areas of retirement, asset management, and wealth management. The transaction will also enable us to further increase our investment in retirement and insurance the better serve each and every client in these important segments. Our clients will benefit from expanded and complementary investment capabilities across key asset classes with strong long-term track records. Specifically, the acquisition of Putnam will increase Franklin Templeton\u2019s defined contribution AUM to almost $100 billion. As a reminder, the acquisition of Putnam is expected to be modestly accretive to run rate adjusted EPS by the end of the first year after closing, adding approximately $150 million of run rate adjusted operating income in the first year post-closing inclusive of cost energies. The acquisition remains on track to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions. Turning now to our specific numbers for the quarter, starting first with assets under management and flows, ending AUM increased to $1.43 trillion, primarily due to market appreciation, and we shifted into positive long-term net flows of $200 million, inclusive of reinvested distributions. Our long-term net flows continue to benefit from a diversified mix of assets in the quarter, led by record net inflows of $4 billion into alternative strategies. Our three largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, and Lexington Partners generated a combined total of almost five billion in net inflows. This included raising over one billion in secondary private equity in the wealth management channel, under the alternatives by Franklin Templeton brand. Today, alternative assets are $257 billion or 18% of our total AUM and contribute more significantly to our financial results. In terms of other areas of activity in the quarter, our multi-asset strategies generated another quarter of positive net flows with 2.3 billion. Our solutions team has been gaining success with large institutions building customized solutions across our broad array of investment strategies. Equity net outflows improved to $3 billion this quarter, including the funding of a previously disclosed $3.2 billion institutional mandate. While active equities continue to be impacted by the risk-off environment, we saw positive net flows into international, large-cap core, emerging markets, all-cap value, and small-midcap equity strategies. Fixed income net outflows were $3.1 billion. Despite market uncertainty, we experienced increasing demand for fixed income and we benefited from having a broad range of strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies. Client interest continued with net inflows into multi-sector, core bond, enhanced liquidity, and tip strategies. Our regionally focused sales model and strategy resulted in improving flow trends across all of our geographies compared to the prior quarter. As mentioned earlier, the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions generated positive long-term net flows. From a vehicle perspective, ETFs generated net inflows of $1.1 billion, representing the third consecutive quarter of net flows of approximately $1 billion, and AUM totaled $16.2 billion at quarter-end. In the quarter, we also launched two thematic ETFs in Europe, in both future food and health and wellness. Two areas where we expect to see strong client interest. Separately managed account AUM ended the quarter at $116 billion and generated positive net flows. We continue to expand our SMA offerings in important growth categories and new market segments to provide clients\u2019 choice and how they access our investment expertise across the breadth of our products. This quarter, we had important launches focused on customization, such as tax-managed overlay and SMA key flagship strategies, including the Franklin income fund. Canvas, our custom indexing solution platform, continued its trend of net inflows in each quarter since the platform launched in September 2019, and its AUM has doubled to $4.5 billion since the announcement of the acquisition. This past quarter, Canvas generated net inflows of approximately $300 million and continues to have a robust pipeline. Canvas allows financial advisors to build and manage custom indexes in SMAs that are individually tailored to the client-specific needs, preferences, and objectives. We believe custom indexing represents the next progression of direct indexing and ETFs and is a significant long-term growth opportunity. Turning now to investment performance, which we are pleased to say remains strong. 63% 53% 67% and 63% of our strategy composite AUM outperformed their respective benchmarks in the 1-3-5 and 10-year periods respectively. For mutual fund investment performance, 44% 58% 66% and 51% of our AUM outperform their peers on a 1-3-5 and 10-year basis. This represents improvement in the 3-year and 5-year periods from the prior quarter due to strengthened performance in equity and certain fixed income strategies. The 1-year decline was primarily due to one of the largest funds managed for income, which was overweight utilities and financials which generate higher yield and underweight technology compared to the S&P 500. Touching briefly on our financial results, ending AUM increased by 0.7% to 1.43 trillion as of June 30th from the prior quarter reflecting market appreciation and positive net flows. Average AUM was flat from the prior quarter at 1.42 trillion. While our sector fee rate remains stable, adjusted operating revenue increased by 3% to 1.56 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 8.3% to $476.8 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30.5% compared to 28.9% in the prior quarter. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with total cash and investments of $6.9 billion as of June 30th 2023. To wrap up, we have worked through another quarter of complicated markets and our progress and success would not be possible if it weren\u2019t for our dedicated employees around the world. I would like to thank them for their many contributions and for their unwavering client focus. Now, let\u2019s turn to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe we could start with some of the trends you\u2019re seeing in the alternative asset management space. First, I was hoping we could get a little bit more color on how much capital Lexington raised in the second quarter in their flagship fund and as you highlighted in the deck continuing to find race here. So how large do you think the size could ultimately be? And then when you expand a little bit broader into private alts generally, what else is in the pipeline that you expect to come in over the next 6 months to 12 months? Jennifer Johnson : So, I think we publicly disclose that Lexington\u2019s raised 18.2 billion so far on their way to fund. I think in the quarter it was about a little over 3 billion, maybe 3.4. And of that, I think what we\u2019re incredibly proud of is the fact that we raised a little over a billion dollars in the wealth channel. First time fund, I think the expectation was that if we raised 500 million that would be pretty good for a first time fund. And we\u2019ve talked to these calls before about how complicated it is to raise alternatives in the wealth channel because it requires not only retraining of your own sales team, but actually training of the financial advisors. And so we put a lot of effort over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve built out a 40-person alts well, specialist team. We\u2019ve used our CASM to train our own internal sales folks as well as helping to train the financial advisers. So that was a great part of it. And I think the fund can rate up to $20 billion. And I think it\u2019s quite possible that, that will happen. Alexander Blostein : Great. And then just as far as the pipeline of other things there in the hopper as you look out over the next 6 months to 12 months? Jennifer Johnson : Well, it\u2019s specifically in all space. I mean so private credit, we still think is just a great opportunity. Our view is that banks are going to even when less and they\u2019ve been lending. And it is definitely from deploying capital to slowed down by the fact that M&A has slowed down. Just write an article yesterday where something was talking about they\u2019re seeing M&A pick up. That will make a difference. We\u2019re thrilled because having BSP at $78 billion; we cover both the U.S. and Europe. But in addition to that, one of the things that\u2019s actually really important in these times is having the knowledge and expertise in special situations where you could work out deals. So if you have an underlying credit that is struggling because of maybe they can\u2019t cover their rates, being able to restructure it is really important, and BSP had that expertise internally. So the biggest issue there has been around deploying, but they\u2019re seeing -- continue to see very good deals. They\u2019re seeing their underlying companies be very strong and where there are some stresses, they\u2019ve been able to handle those workouts. And again we think as M&A activity picks back up, you\u2019re going to -- they\u2019re going to be able to deploy more capital. They said they\u2019re seeing the best deals since they\u2019ve seen since the global financial crisis. And then in the case of real estate with Clarion, probably the biggest issue is price discovery. Now I think everybody knows the office story. Unfortunately, Clarion has just about 10% exposure to office. So that\u2019s not been a big exposure for them. Their focus has been on industrial space, data centers and things like that, which with AI, frankly, will only get bigger and more demand, but also multifamily. And I think the story about the underbuilding of multifamily is important. But the issue has been a little bit around the bid ask on just the sellers being willing to accept lower prices and the buyers being willing to pay. So as that -- as we see that move out, I think you\u2019ll see more movement in the real estate space. They just on the redemption to you, just a reminder, their clients are mostly institutional. And so they don\u2019t have the kind of requirement to do redemptions because the institutions don\u2019t want any kind of fire sale. And so they have more flexibility on their redemption queues which equates to less than I think 2%, if any -- Adam, it looks like you want to add something there. Adam Spector : Sure. I was going to say a couple of things, Alex. One, I think we see strong fundraising in the traditional markets that they\u2019ve been in, but with stronger public markets, the denominator effect is less than an issue. So we\u2019re feeling really good about the raise for all of our alternative firms in the private markets. I would also say that in the Wealth channel, it\u2019s not just the Lexington flagship we\u2019re offering. We have Clarion products in there like CP Reef an opportunity zone that are going well, launching BDCs and interval funds for BSP, our venture funds in the Wealth channel. So feeling good about that. And then the Alcentra acquisition has been very positive for us and having the ability to launch a European managed product in Europe through our distribution force there, we think will be a very positive add as well. Matthew Nicholls : And then one other data point, Alex. In terms of dry powder, BSP has in excess of $4 billion. And over the next 12 months, they expect to raise several billion dollars more. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Super helpful. Just a quick follow-up, staying on the alts for a second, and it\u2019s a little bit of a nuanced question, but when we look at the roll forward in the AUM table, it looks like the old had a negative market. And I\u2019m a little surprised just given that the mark-to-market dynamic generally have been positive in other places. So is it a lag? Or is there something idosyncratic that drove the negative mark-to-market in the old bucket of things? Thanks. Jennifer Johnson : I think we had positive marks in BSP and Lexington and the slightly negative in mineralizations in real estate. So I\u2019m not sure, but -- it may have been redemption. I\u2019m not sure what you were referring to Alex. Alexander Blostein : Okay. We can circle back, it\u2019s probably real estate. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hey thanks very much. So wanted to drill a little further in Putnam is interesting because after Benefit Street in Lexington, I think our minds were all focused in the old world. And so I like the partnership we formed with them. I like the $25 billion investing with you, the 5-year lockup on the stock. I\u2019m curious on the insurance and the retirement channels, Were they growing there? Which strategies? And then more importantly, with your broad diversified offering, what do you expect that you can actually sell into that channel so like lever that distribution? Adam Spector : Sure. It\u2019s Adam here. So a couple of things. I would say, one, with Putnam, we get tremendous investment performance. I think they\u2019re the only firm that had their fund family in the top 10 for like the 3 to 5 in the 10-year period. So good investment performance across the board. They bring a few investment capabilities that we did not have before. Target date is a good example where they have $6.5 billion and given that about a third of the assets in D.C. go into things like that, we\u2019re feeling that, that gives us a real leg up. Stable value and Ultrashort are two other areas where they\u2019re quite strong. They have been very strong in both insurance and the DCIO market. And our plan there is to really integrate those two distribution teams so that we will be stronger in each and every client that we partner with. We have a broad range of clients in the insurance and DCIO space. And we think together, the two teams will be able to serve all of them in a much more effective way. Jennifer Johnson : And I just add -- I mean I\u2019m just looking at the morning start flows, I think it\u2019s something like 4 to the top 10 slowing categories or target date funds. And so having a good performing target date with really what Putnam brings is the expertise on selling into the retirement channel that we\u2019re really excited. We think that, that will benefit all the retirement platforms that we do business with. And then as Adam mentioned, just having two great products and a stable value in the target date to be nice to add to our suite. Matthew Nicholls : And then Glenn, the only thing I\u2019d add on Putnam is just to make the point that, obviously it\u2019s been a month ago, actually over a month now since we announced the transaction, their AUM is up slightly by 2% to 3% based on the market the flows have been stable. The performance is still as strong as Adam just outlined, we\u2019ve got team agreements in place with all the key investors and our planning process around the acquisition of what we expect to get out of the acquisition from both a financial perspective and the strategic perspective, as Adam and Jenny just mentioned, we feel that we\u2019re very much on track as we communicated at the time of the acquisition announcement. Glenn Schorr : Alright. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about capital deployment. The cash balance continues to rise here. Cash and investment $6.9 billion, nearly $7 billion. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about putting that to work from here it sounds like a little bit of debt pay down, some buybacks limited to offset share dilution. So it seems like meaningful capital to work in M&A, so just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that opportunity set as you look out from here. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So I think our capital management strategy is going to remain consistent with what we communicated in the past. Number one is maintaining the trajectory of our dividend. We\u2019ve had over many, many years. Number two is organic growth opportunities in the business. Number three, as you alluded to it\u2019s hedging our employee grants it might look like we\u2019re a little bit behind on that front in the context of the shares we\u2019ve repurchased to date, but we will catch up on that this quarter and make sure that we are very much in line with that communication that we\u2019ve been consistent about. We obviously have debt that we need to service. We paid down $300 million of debt in July. As announced, and that was the term loan that we had in place, and we paid that off. We\u2019re saving about $4.5 million by doing that, but we\u2019re retaining the exact same amount of liquidity by replacing that $300 million term loan with a larger revolver. So we\u2019ve taken our $500 million revolving credit facility and a $300 million term loan, which was $800 million in total. Paid off the $300 million term loan and replaced it with one single $800 million 5-year revolving credit facility. So we\u2019ve actually enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility by doing that and saved $4 million to $5 million in the process. And then opportunistic share repurchases on top of that in M&A. I think Jenny has mentioned several times, we\u2019re very interested in the infrastructure space around M&A and the alternative asset space in particular. And in terms of the opportunistic share repurchase, the way I would describe that as a consequence of how we decided to fund the Putnam acquisition. We\u2019re issuing 33.3 million shares when the closing date occurs and we expect to start repurchasing those shares in a methodical manner. All else being equal in fiscal 2024, obviously, after the date that we\u2019ve closed the transaction so we certainly expect to pick up share repurchase [Ph] consequence of doing that transaction. Michael Cyprys : Great, thanks. Just a quick follow-up question, more broadly, AI, generative AI getting a lot more attention these days. So just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the potential and opportunity from AI? Is this a revenue or an expense benefit? What sort of impact do you think this could have on the competitive landscape? And maybe you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re experimenting to what extent would that today? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So I mean, fortunately, I think that\u2019s probably one of the benefits of being headquartered in Silicon Valley. We\u2019ve been actually doing some work in AI for the last four years. If you probably have heard about our gold optimization engine tool that\u2019s all built on AI. And we\u2019re doing what others are doing around you use AI for early warning systems, so things like risk management, business intelligence, intelligent automation. So we have a proof of concept or a pilot going on where we have our -- it\u2019s sort of like a portfolio research assistant. So it\u2019s summarizing 10-Ks and annual reports for our PM teams. One of the most important things you have to do is to build a sense around your data so that you\u2019re not training the world on your own data. And so we\u2019ve had that undergoing, we\u2019re working on things like conversational AI to for help desk hoping to respond within 10 seconds. We\u2019ve got a pilot going on to generate a draft fund commentary. Again, it\u2019s all training the models to be able to see good generating marketing material. So we\u2019re -- and we\u2019re using both Azure and Amazon because we\u2019re not quite sure what\u2019s the best for us from the language model. So we have -- the message is we\u2019ve got quite a bit going on here. We\u2019ve been early in it because the GO product sort of got us in there. And we think it will be both -- I think initially, it\u2019s more of a expense benefit and efficiency benefit, but you hope that it makes your portfolio managers and research assistance more efficient and then things like go are revenue-generating tools. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt at Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning everyone. Sorry if I missed this, but is there any change to your expectations for expenses this year? And do you have any early thoughts on how to think about the path into fiscal 2024 as we enter the fourth quarter? Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thank you. So I\u2019ll go through what we expect in the fourth quarter in terms of the guide and then that will lead to what the full year guide is essentially. So firstly, in terms of our EFR rate, we expect it to remain around 39 basis points. I think it might be slightly higher than 39 basis points in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s called it around 39 basis points. In terms of comp and benefits, again, this is all fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, I would assume $50 million in performance fees, as we\u2019ve described in the past that would lead us to approximately $740 million in comp and benefits. IS&T, we put that similar to what we described last quarter at 120, very consistent. Occupancy in the mid- to high 50s. We guided the high 50s. Last quarter, we came in a little bit lower than that, we expect to be roughly the same again. And in G&A, we expect to be in the mid-140s, inclusive of continued normalization of T&E for the quarter. In terms of what that means for the year, due to higher assets under management, better performance increased fundraising related to increased fundraising related compensation and expenses, our overall guide increases slightly to just over $4 billion. It\u2019s very similar to what I described last time, but maybe slightly higher than that, certainly on the high end of 4.8 or something like that, $4.09 billion. But again, that\u2019s all -- that\u2019s assuming the market stays where it is today, and it\u2019s assuming those -- that excluding performance fees, that is as I described. I mean then in terms of the margin, though and I think you\u2019ve asked about this several times in the past year, it\u2019s obviously difficult to guide on the margin because that means we\u2019re guiding on revenue, essentially but all else remaining equal, we expect our operating margin to be stable in the 30% area in the next quarter. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. And any thoughts on next year? Or is it still too early? Matthew Nicholls : It\u2019s too early. The only thing I\u2019d say -- it\u2019s an interesting question obviously, because we\u2019re going to be in the process of implementing or integrating the Putnam acquisition. I think as we\u2019ve dug further into this post announcement and as we get into the integration work and execution work that we\u2019re quite familiar with by now, I think we can say two things. One, you can expect from us continued meaningful expense discipline going into 2024 and I think you can see from us potentially more potential with the acquisition of Putnam as we integrate because we found other areas within Franklin Templeton that we can be more efficient in as a consequence of the transaction. We\u2019ve highlighted in the past that one of the benefits of M&A, we always focus on the growth areas. That\u2019s what drives our acquisitions. But the second sort of derivative of the transactions that we\u2019ve chosen to pursue it has helped us on the expense and efficiency side to re-examine how we do things and re-examine how we can be better and do things better. And as a result of that, I think you\u2019ll find that our expense discipline in 2024 will be -- will continue and perhaps outperform what we\u2019ve communicated in terms of what we get out of the Putnam acquisition. Patrick Davitt : And one quick housekeeping. Could you give us the exact amount of the catch-up fees? And then how much offsetting placement fee was in expenses? Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Yes, the way, Patrick, I would look at that for this quarter is that essentially an operating income 0. So in other words, the revenue associated with the catch-up is practically the same as the expense. In fact, the expenses might have been slightly higher like $1 million or something like that. First of all, operating income neutral. And then... Patrick Davitt : In number so we can kind of get to the run rate of management fees. Matthew Nicholls : $33 million, something like that. In the low to mid-30s. Patrick Davitt : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from BofA. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning. On the Putnam transaction, I know it\u2019s going to bring $25 billion of flows in 12 months after closing. But I want to come back to what could happen from some of the cost cuts because you\u2019re cutting a lot of costs out of the company. I think $150 million. So maybe I\u2019ll provide some perspective on the potential for merger-related dis-synergies or outflows on Putnam\u2019s $140 billion AUM base. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So the 150 million guide that we gave as we announced the transaction that is inclusive of some modest attrition across the company. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019ve got that. I think we, again, have a history, we don\u2019t want to dig sales for this, of course, but we\u2019re extremely focused on asset retention as well as the potential growth. The overlap is relatively modest in this transaction given the complementary investment strategies that Adam outlined at the beginning, and therefore, we expect modest attrition from this transaction across the board, which -- and frankly, we think that any attrition that we get above what we had expected, would be more than offset by other potential operating income and operating expense reductions in the transaction. So again, we stay very firm on the 150, and we think there\u2019s potential to be higher than that. Adam Spector : Craig, the other thing I would add is that given the number of transactions we\u2019ve done and the continuity of portfolio management teams post transaction, we\u2019re getting very good reactions from clients that they feel that their investment teams will be stable, and they don\u2019t make -- intend to make any shift, which is very positive. Matthew Nicholls : I would just also add. Thank you Adam. I\u2019d just also add that I would never understate ever the complexity of integration and implementation and working across the firm involving a new acquisition. But the 150 is 30% margin. So it\u2019s not a hugely aggressive margin objective from that business. We should be able to get to that and exceed it over time. But our guide remember is on the first year, but after that first year, all else remaining equal, you certainly see other opportunities to go beyond that. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Matthew and Adam. One follow-up on the SMA business. You\u2019ve got a great business here. It\u2019s inflowing. I think you highlighted frankly, Income as one of the flagships that\u2019s driving this and also direct indexing. But what are some of the other funds that are driving flows into the SMA business? And then and when you think -- when you look at sales, what does the mix look like across channel? Is it heavily wirehouse? Is it heavily RIA? I\u2019m curious to see what it looks like? Adam Spector : Sure. I think the way to think about that is one, look at the legacy business, and two look at the projection of the business going forward. So if we look at the legacy of the business, it really was strongest at the old Legg Mason, which means that a significant portion of the assets are with Western and ClearBridge, and those firms tended to be stronger in the wires. If you look at the trajectory of the business, it\u2019s really adding new products like our income fund to the SMA platform. We\u2019re already now since recently launching it on 6 broker-dealers and a number of RIAs there. So that\u2019s where -- really where a lot of the momentum is. The other place I would say that we have huge opportunity is in our -- in the SMA businesses in munis, where we\u2019ve seen about a 30% increase in our AUM there year-over-year. And I think that\u2019s a place where we can really grow as well. So again, the strategy is to make sure that we give our clients vehicles of choice. So for all of our key strategies, we\u2019d like to be able to offer them in both the fund format and an SMA format, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re building out right now. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Brennan Hawken at UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just wanted to follow up there on the catch-up fees in Lexington. Number one, this was -- you\u2019re still raising it sounds like. So was this a preliminary close? And do you expect there\u2019ll be further catch-up fees at the actual formal close. And I was just running the math on the 33, and I may be a little confused about your prior comment on fees being expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Do you think there\u2019ll be more catch-up fees in the coming quarter because it seems as though the catch-up maybe contributed about a basis point this quarter. So I wasn\u2019t quite sure about that. If you could clarify. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Brennan. So firstly, I said 33, but I was just using that as a midpoint. That\u2019s not the exact number. We\u2019re not going to guide on where our catch-up fees are going. But I\u2019ll just say a couple of things. So the -- in terms of the fund raise, I think Jenny mentioned this at the beginning, where a couple of things we\u2019re allowed to say around the fund rates. Number one, we\u2019re ahead of target. Number two, we\u2019re at $18.2 billion right now. That was what was announced filed recently. Number three, we\u2019re still fundraising, which means, to answer your question, we may have another closing in the next quarter. We don\u2019t know exactly, but I think it\u2019s likely we have some form of closing in that quarter. And that could have a positive impact on our effective fee rate. But even without, so to speak, I\u2019ll just be clear about this because I think this is a question that Patrick was getting at earlier. I think even without the catch-up be in the fourth quarter our EFR we would expect it to be around 39 basis points. So we\u2019re not -- our 39 basis points is not reliant upon the catch-up fee per se. That\u2019s I think, your -- I think that\u2019s the question you were trying to get at. Correct? Brennan Hawken : Yes, yes, yes. I appreciate that. Just want to try to understand some of those mechanics. So thanks for laying that out. Matthew Nicholls : And then obviously, after the -- when we have this moment in time we do a closing and we have a catch-up fee, and then we have expenses associated with raising the funds. And after that of course, we don\u2019t have those one-off expenses, but we do have the normalized alternative asset higher fee rate against the assets that we\u2019re raising on the entire AUM, which is, as you know, around the 1% area. So and that\u2019s the aspect of the fees that I would focus on that helps our EFR on long-term. That\u2019s what helps us remain around that 39 basis points. Brennan Hawken : For sure. Yes. This is just sort of noise and whatnot. I just wanted to understand it for modeling purposes. So thank you for that. You guys flagged in your comment document. I believe is what is referred to, that there was some improving performance in taxable fixed income strategies, which led to the lift in the investment performance versus benchmark. So just wanted to confirm that Western and whether or not you\u2019re seeing any impact from this improving performance on either RFP activity or client dialogue and what drove the reversal. Thank you. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So the significantly improved performance at Western in core, core plus and macros, trying to remember the numbers exactly, but it\u2019s first quartile year-to-date. And what we\u2019ve seen is significantly improved net flows to the point where I thought we might be positive this month at Western. I\u2019m not sure it will be quite, but it feels like they\u2019ve kind of turned the corner there. I want to address one other just performance because on the 1-year mutual fund ETF performance at 44%. I think it\u2019s really important to understand how significant the Franklin Income Fund can be in swinging this. So that\u2019s 14% of the mutual fund ETF number. The Franklin Income Fund is in -- there\u2019s no such category for multi-asset income in the retail channel at Morningstar. There is an institutional category. And if you were to compare it to the institutional category, they would be an 11th percentile. The peer average yield in that category is about 4.25% versus the Income Fund at 5.75%. The peer average in the retail category yield 1.84% versus 5.75%. So if there were an income category at Morningstar, they would be in the top quartile, and that would swing us up to 58% up. And because it\u2019s so significant, I just feel like it\u2019s important to understand, it just isn\u2019t a category. Unfortunately, the $1.5 billion in flows that we\u2019ve had net flows in the Franklin Income proves that the income strategy is as relevant today as when my grandfather started its 70-plus years ago despite the fact that there are no true peers in that space. Adam Spector : And to that, I just might add because your question was about RFPs and pipeline and such. What we\u2019re really seeing is if you think about a sales pipeline, a significant build up in late-stage opportunities but what we\u2019re not seeing is the conversion to that as quickly as we would expect to one but not funded. And that is really because we believe a number of institutions are waiting for the interest rate cycle to settle in. Are we going to have one more hike, what will happen to inflation. So that last stage of deployment and final contracting is a little slower, but we do see a bit of a bulge building up in those late-stage opportunities. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth Worthington : Hi, good morning. When commenting on the improvements in multi-asset product flows, you mentioned Solutions as a contributor. To what extent are alternative investment capabilities important to growing Franklin Solutions AUM? And to what extent are your existing alternative products already integrated with your public market capabilities within the Solutions ecosystem? Jennifer Johnson : So I would say that, that depends more on the clients. So for example, FDIS has won mandates in model portfolios in the retail channel and very few of those have so far included alternatives in those model portfolios. On the other hand, they\u2019ve also won insurance mandates that have some combination of alternatives in there. I think that\u2019s more -- I think that question, it depends more on the channel the FDIS, Franklin Templeton Solutions, Investor Solutions Group is serving then how that group performs. Adam Spector : The other thing, Jenny, that I would add to that is that we can really build traditional only a mix or what we\u2019re starting to do now is to build alts only solutions as well, where if a client wants to have a single source for private equity venture, private debt, real estate, I think we\u2019re one of the few firms that can build those for clients. Jennifer Johnson : And actually, one thing is we also have been working with some retirement platforms who are interested in trying to figure out how to bring alternatives to retirements and building sleeves to go leases and managed accounts and some models in there. So we think that\u2019s a real opportunity. Kenneth Worthington : Okay. So Solutions really isn\u2019t about combining these different capabilities together and providing a solution that results from the combination. It\u2019s really just solutions in single silos marketed out? Jennifer Johnson : No, I don\u2019t right -- so they can be. No, because it might be that somebody wants an income solution model portfolio right or LDI type and so they will go in, depending on what the client desired outcome is, and they will use multiple of our managers to bring that ultimate solution to the client. If I can it\u2019s a real OCIO type situation. They even do -- they have a team that researches outside managers. But most of their solutions include multiple of our SIMs. Kenneth Worthington : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Fannon : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to clarify on performance fees, what the funds or affiliates that were the contributors. And I know I hear the guidance, and you\u2019ve been consistent with that, but you\u2019ve also consistently been above that in terms of the results. So as you think about where high watermarks sit and we think about fourth quarter, and even potentially into December, which has some other crystallizations how we should think about maybe where performance sits for that performance eligible AUM? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So this quarter, it was -- and it has been for the last few, I mean, even though we received performance fees from several of our specialist investment managers, in particular, on the alternative side, there has been a meaningful portion of it driven by our Clarion Specialist Investment Manager on the real estate side. And 80% of the performance fees is driven by multiyear performance thresholds being hit by clients that invested five years ago where a 5-year performance threshold has been hit. We expect going into next quarter performance fees, I think we continue to guide at 50 because it\u2019s so hard to predict this in any form of accuracy but we guide between $50 million and $60 million for the quarter. As you mentioned, going into the -- our first fiscal quarter, which is the last calendar quarter, the fourth calendar quarter, that\u2019s sort of a little bit more widespread across the Specialist Investment Managers, and we may experience a little bit more performance these then. But we\u2019ll provide more guidance on that next quarter when we get to that point. Daniel Fannon : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Adam, just a broader question on distribution. Given all of the acquisitions over the last several years, I was hoping you could update us on how much of the AUM is actually utilizing the centralized distribution at this point? And where you are in terms of onboarding, whether it\u2019s some of the Specialist Managers or acquisitions that are more recent in terms of closing in terms of fully onto that platform to think about the momentum and where you are in that process? Adam Spector : Sure. I think let me go back to where the starting point was, which was that the central distribution team was responsible for globally, all institutional and all Wealth management raising and client servicing for legacy Franklin Templeton. On the Legg Mason side again, it was more the SIMs handled a large portion of their institutional asset management, especially in the U.S. What we\u2019ve seen over the last two years is a gradual movement towards a more coordinated global efforts. I would say that movement is quicker at a smaller firm like Martin Currie, where the benefits of centralized resources are much more significant. If you look at the other end of the spectrum at Western that has a massively well built out global distribution capability of their own. It\u2019s really more episodic where the central distribution team is raising assets for them. So it does depend on the side, but the -- on the size, but the movement has been to find more places to cooperate. And we\u2019re also seeing a lot of benefits in the alternative space where the general salespeople are able to make introductions that then the alternative firms can close on their own. Daniel Fannon : Is there any way to put numbers around that in terms of like what still is held at the affiliate manager level versus... Adam Spector : Yes. I can tell you I shy away from that because what we\u2019re trying to build is a culture of cooperation where these teams work together and numbers imply that 1 team did it or the other team did it and what we\u2019re really trying to move towards just where it\u2019s a collaborative effort. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks, good morning everyone. Just want to hop back on the Franklin Income Fund for 1 second. I think that\u2019s from that moderate allocation Morningstar category. But -- and I agree with what you\u2019re saying about the performance and the sort of mischaracterization of it. But do financial intermediaries used that MorningStar? Or have you seen them use that Morningstar categorization in terms of, I guess, just recommending the fund because I do see it still in outflows despite the improved performance. Jennifer Johnson : Well, I actually think it\u2019s in net flows, so that\u2019s why I said there was about $1.5 billion in net flows. Look it is a frustration. During when interest rates grew 0, he was in the 80% equity category because, of course, he look for dividend yielding equity because you couldn\u2019t get anything in income. And then as you\u2019ve been able to earn money in fixed income, you shifted. So now he\u2019s in the 50% to 70%, so yes, it\u2019s honestly, it\u2019s a discussion I personally at with Morningstar on it, and they\u2019re just the problem is there\u2019s no real competitors in the Wealth channel that -- so they can\u2019t build a big enough peer group. And so we often point to the institutional one and his outperformance there. And so to answer your question, yes, I\u2019m sure there are some situations where it gets screened out. On the other hand, the team has tremendous following and loyalty. And one of the challenges has been as the world went to fee-based it\u2019s harder for some financial advisers to buy and hold the income fund for 10 years, like they used to do. And that\u2019s why we really pushed to get it on the SMA platform because they can hold it on an SMA platform, and they do, they love it. They\u2019ll put a client in there and sit through them quite retirement. So it\u2019s a message that we continue to try to get the story out. And I just think that because it\u2019s 14%, it was important that people understand how much it will swing our 1-year category already the categories that came. But he\u2019s going to manage it; the team is going to manage it for yield, which is what the clients expect. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin\u2019s President and CEO for final comments. Jennifer Johnson : Right. Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call. And again, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, and we look forward to speaking to you all again next quarter. So thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. As usual, Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are joining me on the call. Over the past several years, we've made great strides in transforming our business, all in an effort to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders around the globe no matter the market environment. We've done this by creating a diversified company that offers a broad range of investment expertise and capabilities across asset classes, investment vehicles and geographies. Today, we're able to offer our partners and investors the ability to fulfill their comprehensive investment needs across public and private markets and in the vehicle of their choice as one firm with specialist investment managers operating around the globe. In addition, we have made important investments in value-added services, including technology, digital wealth and customization in order to be on the forefront of innovation in areas increasingly important to our clients. As we look back over our fiscal year, challenging global financial markets and geopolitical uncertainty weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The so-called Magnificent Seven, 7 large U.S. tech companies, have primarily driven all of the gains in global stocks this year. And in our fourth quarter, we saw heightened volatility lead to increasing pressures and declines across equity and fixed income markets. We believe markets, like the one we're in, reinforce the value of active management with a long-term investment horizon. So often in these times of uncertainty, where the best opportunities to capture value are identified. In this complex and volatile market environment, it's no surprise that there's a tremendous amount of cash sitting in bank accounts and in money market funds, capturing what are the most attractive short-term yields in more than 15 years. Global Money market assets stood at $7.4 trillion as of September 30, the highest asset level since Morningstar started collecting the data in 2007. We have been actively engaging with our clients to understand their needs and address their strategic goals. Many clients continue to look for additional access to private markets, alternative credit, in particular. And as yields have become more attractive, clients have had a renewed interest in fixed income. We continue to provide insights and taught leadership to help them navigate the latest conditions, including drawing upon the resources of our various specialist investment managers and the Franklin Templeton Institute. Against this backdrop, we continue to manage our global business with a focus on areas of organic growth, expense discipline and strategic transactions. As such, this year, we are pleased with the progress made executing on our long-term corporate priorities by expanding our investment capabilities across vehicles and deepening our presence in key markets and channels. For the fiscal year, notwithstanding 20% lower inflows. Long-term net outflows improved 23% from the prior year. Long-term net flows were positive in several key areas, including alternatives, multi-asset, ETFs, Canvas and the high net worth channel. In addition, our Asia Pacific region generated positive long-term net flows for the fiscal year. Our EMEA region turned positive in the second half of fiscal 2023 and our non-U.S. regions posted positive net flows in the fourth quarter. One of our strategic priorities has been to increase our scale in key segments of the industry, reflecting long-term client demand. In this pursuit to offer more choice to more clients, we closed the acquisition of Alcentra, a leading European credit manager, doubling our alternative credit AUM. Firm-wide alternative AUM increased by over 13% to $255 billion from the prior year, making Franklin Templeton one of the largest managers of alternative assets. Alternative AUM represents approximately 19% of our long-term AUM and approximately 25% of adjusted revenues, excluding performance fees in fiscal 2023. Alternative assets management fee revenues increased 36% year-over-year. Furthermore, we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of Putnam Investments with $136 billion of AUM and our relationship with Power Corporation and Great-West Lifeco, strengthening our presence in the retirement and insurance segments. The transaction will enable us to further bolster our presence in these key market segments to better serve all our clients and remains on track to close in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023. Industry-wide, we continue to see consolidation of asset management relationships. In this context, there are increased expectations for value-added services and we believe we are well positioned as a strategic partner due to the breadth and depth of our investment capabilities, technology, content and capital resources. As we look ahead in 2024 and beyond, with better clarity on interest rates and markets in general, there will be an increased likelihood of investors moving money from the sidelines. We believe we are well positioned to capture money in motion as clients benefit from the expertise of each of our specialist investment managers, particularly in areas where there is strong client demand such as alternatives, income, fixed income, solutions and custom indexing. Turning now to our specific numbers for the fiscal year, starting first with assets under management inflows. Ending AUM was $1.37 trillion, an increase of 6% from the prior year, primarily due to market appreciation and the acquisition of Alcentra. Investment performance continues to be strong and resulted in 61%, 48%, 47% and 61% of our strategy composite AUM outperforming their respective benchmarks on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year basis. Compared to the prior year, AUM outperforming benchmarks stayed the same in the 3-year period and declined in the 5-year and 10-year periods. 1-year performance improved significantly due to several equity strategies, including non-U.S. strategies and select U.S. taxable fixed income composites. Long-term net outflows were $21 billion and improved by 23% from net outflows of $28 billion in the prior year. Reinvested distributions were $21 billion compared to $32 billion in the prior year. Our long-term net flows while challenged for the year, continued to benefit from a diversified mix of assets and strong presence in key areas. Multi-assets saw a 66% increase in net flows from the prior year and were positive for all 4 quarters, including nearly $8 billion, driven by Franklin Income Fund, Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions and Canvas, our custom indexing solution platform. In fact, our flagship Franklin Income Fund celebrated its 75th anniversary in August. The strategy follows a flexible value-oriented investment philosophy, seeking income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in dividend paying stocks, bonds and convertible securities. The fund has successfully delivered uninterrupted dividends across all market cycles ever since its launch in 1948. It's also a great example of how we're giving investors greater choice in how they access the strategy, including through SMAs, sub-advice strategies and in an actively managed ETF vehicle around the globe. For the fiscal year, alternative net inflows were approximately $6 billion, driven by growth in private market strategies which were partially offset by outflows in liquid alternative strategies. Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington Partners together generated net inflows of nearly $11 billion. We continue to make strides in alternative assets unlocking new opportunities for investors in our firm. Retail and high net worth investors remain under-allocated in alternatives relative to institutions. Client interest was strong for alternative strategies on wealth management platforms under the alternatives by Franklin Templeton brand in the U.S. which was launched earlier this year. For example, we anticipate over 20% of the total capital raised in our current secondary private equity fund to come from the wealth management channel. We continue to focus on client education initiatives through our alternative focused podcasts and webinars partnering with the Franklin Templeton Academy. Fixed income net outflows decreased by approximately 50% to $16 billion this fiscal year, with net flows significantly improving starting in the second quarter of the fiscal year. In a year when all eyes were on the bond markets and interest rates, we continue to benefit from having a broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies. Brandywine Global saw positive net flows for the year. Franklin Templeton fixed income saw positive net flows in the second half and Western Asset had positive net flows in its core and muni products for the year. Fixed income strategies also saw net flows in ETFs and starting in the second half of the year in SMAs. With the addition of Putnam, we will further strengthen our fixed income offering, particularly with ultrashort, stable value and longer duration strategies with strong long-term investment performance. Equity net outflows were nearly $19 billion. The risk-off environment continued to impact investor sentiment on select equity growth strategies which were partially offset by net inflows into large-cap core, international, smart beta quantitative and emerging market strategies. We believe that emerging markets equities could be a potential bright spot in equities as investors look across broad markets for opportunities. Turning to ETF, since launching our ETF business in 2016, we have provided our clients with a broad range of investment strategies and have achieved significant growth milestones. ETFs generated net inflows of nearly $4 billion in the fiscal year, representing 4 consecutive quarters with net flows of approximately $1 billion and AUM ended the quarter at over $16 billion. We continue to launch new and innovative ETFs based on client interest. During the fourth quarter, both Western Asset and Brandywine Global launched active fixed income ETFs and we expect to see strong client interest in both strategies. We are a leading franchise in SMAs with $113 billion in AUM, an increase of 13% from the prior year. We saw momentum in our SMA platform with $1.3 billion of long-term net flows in the second half of the fiscal year. This year, we continued to expand our SMA capabilities with launches focused on customization such as tax managed overlay and SMA products of key flagship strategies, including the Franklin Income Fund. Through new technologies, we're continuing to enable personalized portfolio solutions that seek to improve bespoke outcomes for investors. A good example is Canvas which has achieved net inflows each quarter since the platform launched in September 2019 and AUM has more than doubled to $4.8 billion since the acquisition closed. This year, Canvas generated net inflows of approximately $1.5 billion and had 20 new partnerships. In addition, it continues to have a robust pipeline. Private Wealth Management AUM ended the quarter at $34 billion with Fiduciary Trust International, generating its 12th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows. Fiduciary Trust provides personalized solutions to high net worth individuals and multifamily offices with an average client relationship of 16 years. It is a growing client base and a platform well positioned for long-term growth. Since 2010, Franklin Templeton has been the investment manager and sole administrator of Fondul. In July, Fondul's largest holding, Hidroelectrica, Romania's leading energy producer, broke a record as being Romania's largest initial public offering on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The listing reflects our ability to provide partnerships with public and private institutions in emerging markets to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders and our enduring commitment to developing the country's local capital market, promoting corporate governance and transparency. Looking forward to 2024, we will continue to further expand our business and invest in key areas of growth that extend our ability to offer more choice to more clients in more places, including alternative asset management, insurance and retirement channels, customization and solutions for clients, technology-related distribution and private wealth management, specifically Fiduciary Trust International. We are proud of the work that we have done over the past several years to further grow and diversify our business. It makes us a more resilient organization over the long run and reflects our focus on positioning Franklin Templeton as a premier partner. Finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated employees around the world for all their efforts in this past year to grow our business by always putting our clients first in a continuously evolving industry. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO and COO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results from the fiscal quarter and year as well as provide an update on the Putnam acquisition. Matt? Matt Nicholls : Thanks, Jenny. Fourth quarter earning AUM was $1.37 trillion, reflecting a decline of 4% from the prior quarter and average AUM was $1.42 trillion, flat from the prior quarter. Adjusted operating revenues increased by 1% to $1.6 billion from the prior quarter and included adjusted performance fees of $98 million compared to $116 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's investment management fees benefited from $36 million in connection with Fondul and were partially offset by lower catch-up fees of $17 million in secondary private equity. This quarter's adjusted effective fee rate which excludes performance fees, was 40.2 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point due to transaction-related management fees earned from Fondul. Adjusted operating income increased 7% from the prior quarter to $512 million and adjusted operating margin increased to 32.4% from 30.5%. The increase from the prior quarter is primarily due to higher investment management fees, the aforementioned management fees earned from Fondul and lower compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by lower performance fees. The specific operating income from Fondul and secondary private equity catch-up fees was $35 million for the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 31% and 33% from the prior quarter to $427 million and $0.84, respectively. The increase in adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS is primarily due to higher other income, higher adjusted operating income for the reasons mentioned and lower taxes. Adjusted EPS increased by $0.05 due to Fondul and secondary private equity catch-up fees in the quarter. Turning to fiscal year 2023 results; ending AUM increased by 6% from the prior year, while average AUM declined by 5%. Adjusted operating revenues of $6.1 billion decreased by 6% from the prior year and included an additional 6 months of Lexington and 11 months of Alcentra. Adjusted performance fees of $383 million decreased from $515 million in the prior year. The adjusted effective fee rate which excludes performance fees, was 39.5 basis points compared to 38.9 basis points in the prior year, primarily due to a full year of Lexington and 11 months of Alcentra. While continuing to invest in long-term growth initiatives, we also continue to strengthen the foundation of our business through disciplined expense management and operational efficiencies. Our adjusted operating expenses were $4.3 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year, again, including a full year of Lexington and 11 months of Alcentra. Excluding performance fee related compensation and the full year impact of Lexington and Alcentra, adjusted operating expenses were down slightly from the prior year. This led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 22% from the prior year, primarily due to lower average AUM, driven by market declines and to a lesser degree, net outflows. Adjusted operating margin was 29.9%, compared to 35.9% in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income declined 28% to $1.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, a decline of 28%. From a capital management perspective, after returning $870 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and funding the acquisition of Alcentra and other acquisition-related payments, we ended the year with $6.9 billion of cash and investments. We will continue to prioritize our dividend which has increased every year since 1982. Purchased shares to hedge our employee share grants and where applicable, review targeted acquisitions to reach our objectives at an accelerated pace. In addition, as we begin in the fourth quarter, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares above the employee-related equity issuances during fiscal year 2024. Turning to the Putnam transaction which, as Jenny mentioned, remains on track to close in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023. Amongst other factors, the transaction is structured to maintain Franklin's -- Templeton's financial flexibility and promote our continuing investments in the business. It also protects our strong financial position in the context of challenging market conditions. At current market levels, the acquisition of Putnam is expected to add total run rate adjusted operating income of approximately $150 million after the first year post closing. Consistent with an approximate 30% operating margin, inclusive of cost synergies and we are ahead of schedule in terms of when we are likely to realize operating income post-close. Assuming this operating income contribution the transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS by the end of the first quarter after closing. And now, we would like to open the call up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Maybe you could just start off on the private market space. You guys continue to raise capital there. Maybe you could just update us on some of the progress across some of the key flagship funds which strategies you think might be entering the market as you look out over the next 12 months. And just on the private wealth channel, I think you mentioned 20% in terms of what you're looking -- expecting to raise or maybe you could just talk about some of the traction that you're seeing in the private wealth channel, in terms of fund placements and new products you might be able to bring on the channel. Jennifer Johnson : Right? Adam? Adam is going to take this one. Adam Spector : All right. Thank you, Jenny. We're seeing strength really across the board. I would say the folks -- the place where we're seeing a lot of interest is -- like others is in the private debt area. They're particularly in the real estate-related debt. We're seeing good growth. We've had a good year in our CLO business. We're out with special situations and new BSP flagship fund, that's all really good. Alcentra is beginning to be integrated more into our distribution force. We're feeling really positive about that as well. Lexington is continuing their fund raiser for Fund 10 and we're just beginning to do some other things there. You mentioned, Michael, the 20% raise that will come from wealth management for Lexington. We're starting to see greater traction for wealth management alternatives across the board. We spent the year really building out our capabilities for U.S. wealth management alternatives and we're now taking that model and using it in Europe. In general, one of the things we're seeing that's quite positive in wealth management alts is the fact that we're now getting on to calendars of 6 month, a year in advance. And once you're in that flow, we think the fundraising really will continue. That's the quick overview. Michael Cyprys : Great. And just a follow-up question, maybe for Matt. I think in the release, you mentioned the transfer agency functions globally have now been outsourced. You did that in the U.S., now you took that around the world. I think also you've outsourced fund administration in the U.S. So maybe you could just talk to what's next as you think of about simplifying the business, enhancing efficiencies, what steps might be able to take over the next year or 2? How meaningful might they be? And just curious, any sort of benefits or lessons learned and takeaways that you could speak to on the transfer agency outsourcing. Matt Nicholls : Yes. So you mentioned 3 key things there. One is the steps we've taken to outsource fund administration, transfer agency and aspects of our technology. What we've been working hard on over the last year or so is what next in terms of our investment management platform in terms of technology. That includes both middle office and back-office functions. And I'd say that we're pretty deep into it and you can expect more updates from us throughout 2024. Jennifer Johnson : Well and I would just add, Mike, as you know, we've done a lot of acquisitions. And I think one of the reasons they work well is, we take our time on some of the integration. And so there's opportunity, obviously, we'll be integrating Putnam into the -- into our environment. And even some of the Legg Mason SIMs are -- have an opportunity to integrate which we think will simplify the environment. Matt Nicholls : Yes. And in terms of the financial impact, Mike, I would just caution you on that. These things take time. As Jenny mentioned, there won't be any additional change in 2024. That's a step change in terms of our expense, in terms of our expenses around the operation. But I think going into '25, '26 or longer term, not only do we have the opportunity to be more efficient across the organization, bringing things closer together in an effective way but also, it's an opportunity to modernize, to reduce CapEx, to make sure that longer term, we're in a position where we can scale at lower expenses with the right partners. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : My question is on the SMA business. And I think you said, ask one question but maybe I could tuck another one in on the SMA within here. But -- what I'm looking for is more details around the components and the growth trajectory. So now that the Franklin Income Fund which is one of your flagship is in the SMA wrapper, I'm just wondering, are there other flagships at Franklin and its affiliates that would make sense also launching into an SMA wrapper? And then -- kind of my 2-parter was, you're generating about $700 million of flows per quarter in the SMA wrapper. Do you think this is a level that could increase significantly from here? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So I mean, you've got to remember, SMAs exist and the reason we're taking off so much is that in the retail channel, where the world went fee-based, it is difficult for a financial adviser whose client fees, they're being charged every month for advice to buy and hold a mutual fund, right? So if you can deliver the same kind of product in an SMA with the holdings basically on the statement, it looks like the advisers being much more active on that. And so we view ourselves as being vehicle agnostic to how we deliver what is our expertise which is our investment capability. And -- so you take, for example, the Franklin Income Fund. The Franklin Income Fund now is -- we have an ETF version, an SMA version and we're seeing growth in both of those. So any of our products can be delivered in SMA. Today, we have munis. Munis are actually -- have a good growth area in the SMA muni ladders. And so the way we are thinking about our business is, I always say it's like a 3-legged stool. It's product capability, geo-global distribution and vehicles. And the vehicles can be mutual funds, communal trusts, ETFs, SMAs, things like Canvas direct indexing. And we should be flexible about how we deliver those, in whatever market we -- whatever market we're operating in. And I think that nobody has won the breadth of product capability that we have to the breadth of geographic distribution, both on the retail and institutional side. And while we may have been late to things like passive ETFs, we were early actually in the active ETF space. And so being vehicle-agnostic is very important. Now the challenge is on the SMAs, is that you have to get approval at the gatekeeper level and then you have to go out and train individual advisers. So it's a bit like alts in the complexity. But once you do that, then you just get consistent flows coming in. So the long answer is basically, we see any of our flagship funds as being able to be delivered through the SMAs platform. Adam Spector : And I just might add that emerging markets is another area where we're seeing significant SMA growth in addition to the munis that Jenny answered. And while a lot of the growth is in SMAs, having a product available like the income fund in SMA, in ETF, a mutual fund across border fund being vehicle-agnostic, really, that just take broader access to different platforms. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Curious about the expectations for expense growth into next year, Matthew. Maybe if you could give us an update there. Matt Nicholls : Sure. Thank you, Brennan. So I'll split it into 3 components, if you'll bear with me. One is, we'll discuss the first quarter guide, our fiscal first quarter guide. Second, I'll give a very preliminary, recognizing how early we are for fiscal year 2024. And then thirdly, I will provide an update on Putnam, because obviously, Putnam, we expect to become an important part of our consolidated guide, if you will. But I want to do that separately because we don't know exactly when it's going to close, so it's speculative at this point but I'll give you that information. And then I'm going to go through the individual components of the expense issues that you focus on, from a modeling perspective. And so firstly, EFR, we expect our EFR to remain in a 39 basis point area, excluding performance fees. Compensation and benefits, we expect -- again, this is first quarter '24 fiscal, we expect compensations and benefits to be at $750 million but please note that this includes $35 million of accelerated deferred comp charges. This also assumes $50 million of performance fees. IS&T, we guided to $125 million, flat to the quarter we just had. Occupancy, we expect that to increase to $65 million from high 50s. And the reason for this is that in New York City, we are transitioning to a more efficient and unified space. We have 9 offices currently in New York City and we are consolidating into 1 major office space in New York. And for a period of about a year, we're going to have the equivalent of double rent on that office. So that means, for the first quarter, this implies 2 months of this, by the way, it's about an $8 million increase; and that $8 million will increase to $12 million of increase, for your occupancy for about a year. After the year is up, that will be -- that will go away and it would normalize back down into the mid-50s again. G&A, we expect to be in the $140 million area and this includes slightly higher T&E and flat placement fees. In terms of our tax rate, we expect that to be 24% to 26% for the fiscal year '24 in terms of full year '24 overall expenses. I'll first of all note that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that between full year '23 and full year '22, we are about 1% lower, excluding performance fees and the various acquisitions that weren't included in the previous year. Full year '24, excluding Putnam, performance fees and the New York City real estate transition that I just walked through, we expect our expenses to be approximately flat, perhaps slightly down. But I would model flat at this point. In terms of Putnam, again, as Jenny and I mentioned that in our prepared remarks, we expect Putnam to close in the calendar fourth quarter and in our fiscal first quarter. We're hoping for December 1. And so the guide that I'm about to provide to you does assume December 1 but that could end up slipping into January 1, for example. But let's hope for December 1. If we close on December 1, from a revenue perspective, we expect to add about $50 million to revenue. Around $42 million of that is expected to be in investment management fees and about $8 million of that is expected to be in services. And you can run rate that by 20 -- by 12 to come up with the annual number for modeling purposes. We expect operating income addition, so the addition to operating income in the first quarter, in other words, for the 1 month, to be between $8 million and $10 million for Putnam. In the second fiscal quarter, we expect to add an incremental $25 million operating income and in both the third and fourth quarters, for Putnam, we expect to add an incremental for both quarters, $25 million to $30 million in operating income, assuming, of course, that revenue remains approximately stable and markets remain stable to where they are. At current levels, we're still guiding, as I mentioned when we announced the transaction to add a total operating income of around $150 million run rate by the time our fiscal year ends in 2024, in other words, by 9/30. This is 10 months, obviously, assuming we close December 1 versus the 12 months that we guided when we announced the transaction. So the change here is not necessarily the $150 million that we've talked about, although we would put that at a minimum at this point based on current markets but the change is when we expect to actually realize the operating income. When we announced the transaction, I described a scenario where we would expect to achieve 25% on a run rate basis at the time of close. And as you can see from the guide of $8 million to $10 million for the first month coming in operating income, this is now indicative of achieving over 50%, let's say, between 50% and 60% of targeted operating income on a run rate basis by the end of month one. So in the actual year, just to be as clear as we can be to help with the modeling. In terms of the actual year, we expect to realize between $85 million and $100 million of operating income and to have reached at least $150 million run rate by 9/30/24, all else remaining equal. And then, the final comment -- sorry, Brennan. I want to make sure this is as complete as possible, so everybody gets the models right. At the end, so what this means in terms of accretion, dilution, because we talked about that, too. At the current time, again, recognizing how volatile the markets are and so on. But the current time, all else remain equal, this would mean a transaction becomes accretive by the second quarter. So in our fourth quarter versus at the end of the first year that we talked about initially. So we're pretty much becoming accretive in this transaction almost right after we close. It's like a couple of months afterwards but let's say just to be conservative at the end of the first 4 quarter after we close. So that would be the end of our second fiscal quarter. Brennan Hawken : Got it. I got my money's worth on that question. Thank you, Matt. Matt Nicholls : That's pretty thorough. Brennan Hawken : Just one clarifying question. So -- and you gave us the -- I think you kind of gave us that $150 million incremental run rate by 9/30 which kind of is a guiding -- sort of a north star. But I believe the walk was, it's like $8 million to $10 million in the first quarter, assuming ending December... Matt Nicholls : First month. Brennan Hawken : That's just 1 month, right? Matt Nicholls : Yes, just 1 month. Brennan Hawken : And then next quarter, that means we're adding $25 million on to that $8 million to $10 million. So getting to $35 million. And then -- and are those -- okay, got it. And those are quarterly, not run rate? Matt Nicholls : Correct. They're actual adds. So by the end of that period, we would have added $25 million at the end of the third and fourth quarter, we would have added another $25 million to $30 million. So at the end of the fiscal year, we would have added up to about $100 million. So it's real actually -- operating income addition is not just run rated. And the reason why I add the $150 million run rate is that, that could be achieved -- sort of an accelerated fashion right at the end of the last fiscal quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay, perfect. That's really, really helpful. Matt Nicholls : Yes. The only other one thing I'd add is that the -- because this is obviously a very important factor in the model as well, as you think about overall AUM and EFR. The Putnam acquisition reduces -- is expected to reduce our EFR by 0.2 basis points because they have a slightly lower EFR than us. Brennan Hawken : Got it. And that is -- and when would the impact of the EFR would that happen pretty much right away? Matt Nicholls : It's over the years. So -- but yes, I pretty much do -- gradually it comes in because -- but it should be right away in December. Brennan Hawken : The run rate impact by the way, it will be adjusted for the timing? Matt Nicholls : Yes. Because as you know, we average -- the AUM gets averaged over the period, it comes in. So it's going to be a bit wonky in the first year -- the first quarter, sorry but you'll soon see the full impact of 0.2. Brennan Hawken : Got it. But the 0.2 is the way we can think about it and then we can adjust for timing accordingly. Matt Nicholls : Exactly, that's a good way of putting it. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Great. Well, thanks for that. I think we could probably end the call right there. So I did want to ask you guys about fixed income, obviously. And look, Western had some nice stabilization in investment performance early in the year. But the latest moves in interest rates put incremental pressure on core and core plus both, absolute and relative to the benchmark. So how are the conversations with clients, I guess, evolving as you highlighted, the opportunity to maybe rotate some of the cash on the sidelines to longer duration products. How big of a headwind do you think that is? And if more capital ultimately chooses to go back to passive vehicles within fixed income like we've seen this year, how is Franklin as a whole, positioned to maybe take advantage of that opportunity in some of the fixed income refers on the passive side? Jennifer Johnson : So interest -- so first of all, core is in positive flows and has remained in positive flows. It's core plus that's been more challenged. We just came from -- we had our international institutional client conference last week. And the walk of the discussion is around, is it time to move cash and go longer duration. So we're also waiting for that moment but we're certainly getting close to it. I think everybody agrees, maybe there's one more increase of the Fed, maybe not but we're definitely near the end. And then the question goes, is it higher for longer? Or do things degrade quickly and rates get dropped. So I think we're fortunate in that we have 4 independent fixed income teams that all actually have slightly different views. And clients align with one of those views. And that's the way we look at managing the business and kind of the insurance policy around it which is to have comfort that we know that we can align something. And the key has been training our sales force to understand those nuances. So that they can be out there and deliver the appropriate product consistent with that client's view. And so yes, there are -- I mean I think Western is probably our top-flowing SIM as far as gross sales, because there are a lot of clients that align with Western view. So -- and we think we're well positioned when they're -- sure, there's going to be X percentage that do passive but there's plenty of them that believe in active fixed income. I'm always one of those that's skeptical when you -- the concept of doing capital allocation based on who's got more debt in the fixed income. So passive fixed income is always a question in my mind but there are clients who prefer that but there are plenty of clients who prefer active fixed income. And with our diverse SIMs, I think we're well positioned to capture that as money moves out of cash into longer duration. Adam, do you want to add anything or? Adam Spector : Yes. I think you hit a lot of the key points, Jenny. Western is having very good conversations with its clients. It continues to be Franklin Templeton's top selling SIM in terms of our gross flows. And if you look at their performance, 88% of their marketed composites have outperformed over the 1-year period. And I think that number, the 10-year period is something like 97%. So yes, in core plus and some other strategies, they've had a tough go of it recently but we see that turning around and we see client interest still being very strong in Western products. Alexander Blostein : Great, that's helpful. And then, Matt, just one for you. Share repurchase is pretty strong in the quarter. I think in your prepared remarks, you alluded to the idea that you might be a little bit more opportunistic. So I was hoping you could maybe flesh that out a little bit more as we're thinking about capital return priorities for next year. Matt Nicholls : Right. Sure. Thank you, Alex. So I think the point we're trying to make on this is that, obviously, that the market is complicated, it's fraught with uncertainty. So we want to be careful of how we describe this. But obviously, we've been very active in acquiring companies to make sure we have the right set of investment management capabilities to be as relevant as we possibly can to the most important clients around the world in every asset class and every vehicle that Jenny mentioned. We feel like we're pretty much done in that regard. There's 1 or 2 areas that we've referenced, infrastructure, for example, in the private markets area of alternative assets. And then maybe there's a few distribution things, a couple of technology things. But in terms of large-scale transactions involving hundreds of millions, in certain cases, billions of dollars, we feel like we're done in that regard for the foreseeable future. Never say never but we certainly feel that we're done in terms of strategic planning. And therefore, I think you can expect us to move into more of a capital return mode opportunistically. So what that means is we're going to absolutely protect our dividends, as we've always described and you can expect the same sort of pattern that you've seen since -- in the 1980s. We're going to be very disciplined in buying back our -- and hedging our employee grants. But as you know, we're left over with a fair amount of cash after that, both in terms of earnings -- from earnings but also in terms of our balance sheet and look, with our shares trading where they are, it's a very good opportunity for us. And as you know, we've funded 90% of Putnam transaction with shares and we'd like to repurchase those shares as soon as we can. So we're going to be quite focused on that. We don't want to give a schedule because the market is too uncertain in our opinion and we need to make sure that we are conservative and careful and methodical and all the rest of it that you expect from us. But the pattern of share repurchase that you saw in this last quarter, again, I'm not saying it's going to be the same number but you can expect us to really focus on opportunistic share repurchases in addition to the share employee grants for the reasons that I've just outlined. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Glenn Schorr : I'm not sure if it's for Adam, for anybody. But so the new DOL rule proposal just came out. And I think this is a long time coming. The focus is updating the definition of what is the fiduciary and investment advice. And given your distribution efforts and prowess in the channel, just curious how you think it may or may not impact Franklin in the various products, various channels. Jennifer Johnson : You know, this -- Glenn, this has been discussed for quite a while and back and forth. And we've all and through the ICI, have had opinions on it. And our view is, it's about education, it's about suitability of products and making sure that advisers are deploying the appropriate product for that client. And we've always had the view that it's our job to make sure that we well inform our distribution partners and provide transparency around that. And so I think our view is that this is not going to have a tremendous impact. Glenn Schorr : Good news. Maybe one follow-up. I appreciate that we're not quite at the finish line yet on Putnam. But as you get to know each other, from my look, I think performance looks good and improving in their products. But as you've gotten closer together, I'm curious what things you're learning, what can you work on for their distribution reach and insurance and retirement? Jennifer Johnson : Well, I think I'll start and then, Adam, you could jump in. I mean, to be honest, like, one of the things that -- we are really excited about this Putnam deal is that, if you're a traditional asset manager, who has a big book of mutual funds, the area from a -- where mutual funds tax disadvantage isn't an issue is in the retirement channel. And so -- and that's a way in which we have always underpunched our weight. And so as we got into this, we couldn't be more excited about combining what we've been putting an emphasis internally, on retirement, with their distribution capability, we worry a lot because as you can imagine, Empower was built out of Putnam. And so really understanding that retirement channel, bringing these teams together and we think that's just going to make us a much, much better distribution partner, not just with Empower but with firms like -- platforms like Principal, Nationwide, Fidelity and being able to have an entry with our stable value in the target date funds. So we look at this and couldn't be more excited about what we think is a great growth opportunity for us in a channel that just even when markets are volatile, people still continue to contribute to their 401(k) through their paycheck. Adam, do you want to add anything to that? Adam Spector : Yes. I would say that in some ways, it reminds me of the Legg Mason transaction when the 2 distribution forces were just so complementary. And if you look at the way that Franklin is built out in the non-U.S. market, as an example, I think that scale there really helps Putnam. If you look at what Franklin Templeton has in terms of SMA capability, ETF capability, that, along with the core Putnam strategy is a real advantage. And finally, I would note that subject to all of the financial comments that Matthew made within those structures, we will be able to add significantly to the sales force. So we'll have a bigger sales force, a more effective sales force by bringing the 2 firms together. That bigger sales force will obviously have more product -- great Putnam product. And so we're feeling that the transaction is really going to help propel us. Jennifer Johnson : And I'll just add on the insurance side, I actually think we gained insurance expertise at the acquisition of Western who has tremendous penetration in the insurance channel. But what's exciting is, now with the alternatives capabilities that we're adding, we can take that expertise and just be a much more relevant partner. And so, as Great-West looked at our capabilities and basically committed $25 billion, it was because it was a detailed bottoms-up analysis of our various SIMs to determine what made sense for them. And that -- we wouldn't have been able to respond to that as well. Had we not had the expertise at Western and we're building it within Franklin and then, of course, the Venerable announcement that we -- the press release we had, I think, last week or the week before, again, comes out of that combined Franklin and Western insurance ideas. So we think there's more to come there as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Another clarification on expenses here. Just -- Matt, your comments on fiscal '24 being flat ex performance fees. I just -- is that versus the reported number in fiscal '23? Or is that ex performance fee comp and other things in it as well? Matt Nicholls : It's ex-performance fees and other comps. So you have to look at the 2 adjusted numbers in that regard. So it's '23... Daniel Fannon : So what is the number for '23? Matt Nicholls : So '23 would be like 4.07 [ph] -- something like that, 4.075 [ph]. And then again, if you -- the full year '24 is really right on that number. Again, excluding the performance fees and the real estate issue that -- the transition I mentioned in New York which is about -- that overall transition is about $50 million or something like that. Daniel Fannon : Okay. And then as a follow-up, just on alternatives. It looks like gross sales were their lowest levels since, like 8 or so quarters. I'm curious if that's just more the environment, timing around what's in the market with you guys? And then also, just specifically, what did Clarion do in the quarter as well as, if Lexington -- the peers that you are looking -- that hasn't had its final close and when you think that might happen? Jennifer Johnson : So Lexington's final close will be in December. So they're scheduled on that. Clarion has had improving redemption queues but they're still -- I don't know, Adam, if you want to -- if you have the details on it. But we've had all 3 strategies were positive for the quarter. Adam Spector : Yes. And I think, Jenny, in there, there's a difference between the -- what we see in alternatives versus private market alternatives because the private markets generally were a little stronger than alternatives overall as we saw some outflows in the liquid alts strategy. Operator : And your next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : So I guess, beating the drum on expenses. So just when looking at adjusted comp for the quarter was better than guidance when accounting for the bigger-than-expected performance fees. What drove this? Was there a lower payout on performance fees this quarter? Or was the core compensation number lower than your prior guidance? And what sort of drove that? Matt Nicholls : Yes. So obviously, you've seen the state of the current markets, Ken, resulted in just lower variable compensation, number one. So that's a combination of AUM revenue, less performance, our performance actually improved a little bit. So -- but just generally speaking, that lowered the compensation. Then we had the transaction-related fee that we mentioned on Fondul that has a higher margin associated with it. So that also helped in that regard. So that's probably lower than you would expect. So I'd say just a combination of just expense discipline around how we manage our compensation going in because remember, this is our year-end. So we've made final adjustments based on where the current market is and expect the next quarter to be. Kenneth Worthington : Okay, fair enough. I'm going to take a flyer in Precidian. Your ETF business is doing well. You have additional fund launches. We're seeing more active ETFs industry-wide. Can you talk about Precidian, to what extent is active ETF proliferation utilizing the Precidian structure? Jennifer Johnson : Look, I think the market has kind of spoken on this topic which is they want transparent active ETFs. And so that's been our area of focus. And so we haven't really pursued anything there and I don't think there's a lot of growth there. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Just one, I've been asked. One quick follow-up on Putnam. Could you give us an update on, obviously, we can see the mutual funds but could you give us an update on how the flows have tracked in the September quarter versus the last quarter and maybe last year in this quarter. Matt Nicholls : Yes. Patrick, I don't mean to be difficult in any way but obviously, we don't own Putnam today. So we're not -- we can't really report their flows to you. I would just say though, their AUM is roughly where we announced the transaction. So I think when we announced the transaction, we were around $136 billion. And during that period of time, their performance has remained very strong. And you know what's happened with the market between now and between then which was late May and now, the market went up for a month or so or a couple of months, then it came down quite hard. And they're roughly where they are and the flow expectations we had from them was to be, based on their strong performance, to be in the flattish area, let's say and I'd say that the results are in line with what we expected. Sorry, I can't give more specificity around it but yes. Patrick Davitt : And one quick follow-up. I know it's early days but could you frame the opportunity with the Venerable partnership you just announced. Any kind of details you can give around the pool of AUM you'll be open to the time line for transitioning that AAM to the Venerable branded funds, et cetera? Adam Spector : Yes. I think we're not going to give, again, sorry to not give too much detail on that but it's a multi-stage project with them, where we're going to be managing assets that we take on over a period of quarters. There's something that we've announced that came out quite recently and I think it's indicative of the way that we are able to work with insurance companies in general, to build things where they are able to more actively and efficiently hedge what's in their portfolio. So it was a customized solution that we built with them. And it's the type of approach we're talking to some other insurance companies about right now. Operator : And your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Just one clarification on the Putnam operating income guidance. Does that include the $25 million investment from Great-West, in that guidance? I guess, is that investment had [indiscernible]. Matt Nicholls : Brian, the answer is no. [Indiscernible] $25 billion is incremental. We guided the $25 billion in terms of fee rate in mid-teens because a large portion of that is insurance general account related from [indiscernible]. We expect that to be incremented by about 50%, [ph]. Brian Bedell : And then, I can follow-up. Can you hear me better now? Jennifer Johnson : Yes, it may be our audio that's having an issue. Brian, did you hear the response? Brian Bedell : No, it kind of got garbled up. Jennifer Johnson : Matt, why don't you try again? Matt Nicholls : Let's try again. This is better? Brian Bedell : Much better. Yes. Matt Nicholls : Okay. Great. So no, the guidance did not include the fees associated with the $25 billion allocation. That's largely from Great-West Life. So the fee rate is around the mid-teens, on the $25 billion, if you calculate the revenue on that. In terms of implementation time line, we expect about half of that to come in the first calendar quarter next year. Well, let's call it the first quarter after we close and then the second half to come in over a period of a year -- one year. We'll obviously keep you updated on that, Brian. Brian Bedell : Yes, that's great. And then just the last question, just on private credit versus public credit. So you've got a ton of different solutions across your specialist managers, including alternatives. Maybe just to zero in on the wealth channel. What are your thoughts about the timing of this reallocation toward fixed income when that picks up? And then, maybe just thinking about it with your private credit offerings versus the public side, do you think one will sort of went out over the -- not went out over the other but one will be larger than the other? And is that cadence, if you have to think about it over the next 2 or 3 quarters, is that sort of an equal cadence, do you think? Or do you think there'll be much larger swing into the public fixed income funds given just your scale there? Jennifer Johnson : I think this is -- well, first of all, we know in talking to our large distribution partners, if there's just a massive amount. One of them commented that their most profitable area right now is their, basically the money market fund because of the massive amount of money sitting in cash on the sidelines. So the wealth channel is no different than the institutional channel in that. The institutional channel is likely to move first and then the wealth channel. The challenge, I think, between traditional fixed income and private credit is that banks just aren't lending like they used to. And so you're not even generating as much of the traditional fixed income as you used to. And so in order to have the investable universe, you're going to probably see the wealth channel starting to move more into private credit anyway. But the reality is, it is illiquid. And I think this is where we are on the product development side, thinking through creative solutions where you actually have products that combine private credit and traditional fixed income. So you have a component of liquidity with the excess returns that are generated in the private markets because of their illiquidity premium. So it's just as any alternative is in the wealth channel, it's complicated because you have the suitability and the DOL rule that was asked is, it's going to mean that the bar is even higher. You can't make mistakes. But from a responsible asset manager trying to figure out how to provide these excess returns in that channel, it's an area of great focus for us. So again, the banks are going to lend the way they used to lend the capital requirements have made it tougher and tougher. You see it in the numbers. And we think that private credit is going to continue to grow. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO, for final comments. Jennifer Johnson : Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating in today's call. And once again, we'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. It's also -- I'd also like to add that we look forward to welcoming the impressive team at Putnam to Franklin Templeton when the transaction closes. And we look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Chief Communications Officer and Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for the first fiscal quarter of 2024. I'm joined by Matthew Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. We're happy to answer any questions you have in just a few minutes. But first, I'd like to call out some notable highlights from the quarter.  Our first fiscal quarter results reflect ongoing momentum in a number of significant areas across asset classes investment vehicles and geographies. Our efforts are always focused on meeting the varied investment needs of our diverse global client base across market cycles, while staying at the forefront of the asset management industry, driven by increased expectations of interest rate cuts by the Fed and other central banks amidst disinflation, the 2023 market rally was particularly concentrated in the last quarter of the calendar year, regardless of the market environment, investors remain cautious.  According to Morningstar, global money market assets stood at $7.7 trillion as of December 31, 2023, the highest level since Morningstar started collecting the data in 2007. Broadly speaking, our specialist investment managers see recession risks moderating and expect the global economy to slow over the course of 2024. But even as the economy slows, there are many opportunities for investors to put that cash to work into risk assets. Specific to the equity markets, last year, we saw a small group of stocks dominate market returns with the top 5 stocks representing 23% of the S&P 500 total market cap. Compare that to the height of the dot-com bubble in March 2000 when that number was 18%. While our investment professionals regard companies like the Magnificent 7 as market leaders, the level of relative outperformance for these stocks is likely unsustainable.  We believe that this backdrop has created an opportunity for active managers like Franklin Templeton that offer a full range of investment capabilities across public and private markets, spanning geographic boundaries in vehicles of our clients' choice. With greater clarity on interest rates in 2024, and as investors look to deploy cash on the sidelines, we believe Franklin Templeton is well positioned.  In short, 2024 is likely to be a year in which balance and diversification are once again rewarded. During the most recent quarter, our clients gravitated towards alternatives, multi-asset equity, ETFs and SMAs, which all saw positive long-term net flows. Continued client interest in private market strategies led to net inflows for our 3 largest alternative managers.  Additionally, we continue to see aggregate positive net flows in non-U.S. regions. We are pleased to announce that our acquisition of Putnam Investments closed on January 1, with $148 billion in assets under management. Putnam adds complementary investment capabilities and a track record of strong investment performance. In fact, 87% or higher, a Putnam's mutual fund AUM outperformed peers over the 1, 3, 5 and 10-year periods. The transaction also enhances our presence in the attractive retirement and insurance markets. The addition of Putnam brings Franklin Templeton's AUM to approximately $1.6 trillion.  In addition, Great-West Lifeco, a member of the Power Corporation group of companies has become a long-term shareholder in Franklin Resources consistent with its ongoing commitment to asset management. We are delighted to have the talented team at Putnam join us and pleased to have Great-West as a key stakeholder.  Turning now to specific results for the quarter, starting with assets under management. Ending AUM increased by 6% to $1.46 trillion from the prior quarter and increased by 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to market appreciation. Average AUM declined by 2% from the prior quarter to $1.39 trillion and increased by 3% from the prior year quarter.  Our specialist investment managers continue to produce competitive investment returns across a broad array of strategies. Investment performance this quarter resulted in 61%, 46%, 60% and 61% of our strategy composite AUM outperforming their respective benchmarks on a 1, 3, 5 and 10-year period.  Notably, investment performance for the 5-year period jumped from 47% in the prior quarter to 60% in the recent quarter, primarily due to certain taxable fixed income strategies. With interest rates at current levels, fixed income opportunities are considered more attractive now and going forward may provide a better total return option over high-yielding cash equivalents. On the mutual fund side, the majority of AUM beat their peer groups and improved percentile rankings quarter-over-quarter in the 1, 3 and 10-year periods. One of our largest funds managed for yield was the primary driver of the decline in 5-year performance. Turning to flows. Long-term net outflows inclusive of reinvested distributions were $5 billion compared to net outflows of $7 billion in the prior quarter and net outflows of nearly $11 billion in the prior year quarter.  Reinvested distributions were $11 billion compared to almost $3 billion in the prior quarter and $12 billion in the prior year quarter. Alternative net inflows were $2.7 billion, driven by growth into private market strategies, which were partially offset by outflows in liquid alternative strategies. Our 3 largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington partners, each had net inflows in the current quarter with a combined total of $3.8 billion. Client interest was strong across a number of alternative strategies on wealth management platforms under the alternatives by Franklin Templeton brand in the U.S.  Earlier this month, Lexington Partners announced the closing of its latest flagship global secondary fund with $22.7 billion of total capital commitments. Fund 10 ranks among the largest funds raised to date and significantly exceeded Lexington's prior secondary fund, which closed with $14 billion in 2020. Fund 10 attracted a diverse group of over 400 investors, including public and corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and wealth channel distribution partners globally.  We are delighted that approximately 20% of the capital raised in the fund came from the wealth management channel, which demonstrates the power of our coordinated global distribution network. We successfully brought together the alternatives expertise of Lexington and our alternatives by Franklin Templeton specialist sales team and leveraged our generalist sales team who have deep relationships across the adviser market.  Also this month, Benefit Street Partners closed its fifth flagship private credit fund with $4.7 billion of total capital commitments. Reflecting the strong demand for the asset class, BSP exceeded its fundraising target. We believe the current market opportunity and backdrop for U.S. direct lending is attractive and BSP has significant underwriting experience, loan structuring expertise and focus on deep due diligence, which provides us with a significant competitive advantage. BSP also announced the completion of the merger between Franklin BSP Lending Corporation and Franklin BSP Capital Corporation, business development companies.  BSP believes this transaction will be immediately accretive to its shareholders and unlock nearly $700 million of capital that can be deployed into a very attractive origination environment. For further context, alternative assets now represent 18% of our AUM and comprise approximately 25% of our total adjusted investment management fees for the last 12 months. In terms of other areas of activity during the quarter, multi-asset net inflows were $500 million, driven by Canvas, our custom indexing solution platform and Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions.  Canvas has achieved net inflows each quarter since the platform launched in September 2019, and AUM has more than doubled to approximately $6 billion since the close of the acquisition. This quarter, Canvas generated net inflows of approximately $400 million and continues to garner client interest across retail and institutional channels.  Equity net inflows were $200 million, including reinvested distributions of $8 billion, while active equities continued to be impacted industry-wide by the risk-off environment we saw positive net flows into all-cap growth, smart beta, all cap value, equity income, large-cap value and small-cap core strategies, among others.  Although fixed income net outflows were $8.4 billion. Client interest drove positive net flows into tax-efficient global opportunistic mortgage-backed securities and multisector strategies. From a regional perspective, we continue to benefit from a regionally focused distribution model, which resulted in aggregate positive net flows in non-U.S. regions for the third consecutive quarter.  For context, we now manage approximately $450 billion in non-U.S. markets, including emerging markets that are poised to grow. Although the U.S. saw long-term net outflows, we are pleased to see our U.S. gross sales, excluding reinvested distributions, improved by approximately 15% from the prior quarter.  We continue to see the benefit of offering investors strategies in a range of investment vehicles. ETFs, for instance, generated net inflows of approximately $1 billion, representing the fifth consecutive quarter with net flows of approximately $1 billion, resulting in over a 40% increase in ETF AUM from the prior year quarter. Including Putnam, ETF AUM is approximately $20 billion. Importantly, we now offer ETFs from a dozen different specialist investment managers, truly bringing the best Franklin Templeton has to offer to the market.  Earlier this month, we launched one of the industry's first bitcoin ETF, consistent with our emphasis on innovation and staying ahead of disruptive technologies. SMAs continue to grow in popularity industry-wide as individual investors look to customize their portfolios. According to Cirelli Associates, SMAs represent about $2 trillion in assets and are expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2026. Our SMA AUM ended the quarter at $125 billion and generated positive net flows for a third consecutive quarter. We continue to make progress with SMA strategies across platforms with Canvas, muni ladder and Franklin Income strategies, each in a positive flow territory for the quarter. Our institutional pipeline saw increased level of funding this quarter, bringing one but unfunded mandates to over $13 billion. The pipeline remains diversified by asset class and across our specialist investment managers.  Turning briefly to financial results. Adjusted operating income declined by 18.5% to $417 million from the prior quarter, an increase by 5.5% from the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on strong expense discipline and our net cash and investments position allows us to continue to invest in growth and innovation for the benefit of clients, shareholders and employees.  Finally, in December, Franklin Templeton was recognized as one of the best places to work in money management by pension and investments. This recognition is a source of pride for us and the credit goes to all of our employees around the world who worked tirelessly on behalf of our clients. I'd like to sincerely thank them for their hard work and dedication to our organization. Now let's open it up to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : So maybe just to get some of the numbers questions out of the way, obviously, with Putnam closed, maybe, Matt, you can give us an update of couple of items, but maybe one, where do you see the management fee, excluding performance fees and kind of catch-up fees jumping off point for the first quarter, first calendar quarter of this year and just broader update, I guess, on accretion and contribution for Putnam for this year. Matthew Nicholls : Okay. Alex, I mean that should probably just give you the forward guide to put things into perspective, that will help get through the Putnam update also. So in terms of the effective fee rate, remember, last quarter, I mentioned we expect it to be around 39 basis points consistent with previous quarters.  We actually ended up at 39.7 or a little bit higher. The reason for that is about 1 basis point or 0.9 basis points was to do with the Lexington catch up fees. So if you think about that for the second quarter, fiscal second quarter guide, we're expecting that to be consistent again excluding these episodic catch-up fee or any other episodic management fee events to about the high 38, so high 38 basis points, very consistent with the previous quarter and other quarters that we presented recently.  So that's in terms of EFR. I'll give the annual EFR guide in the second, which includes Putnam. Of course, we closed Putnam on January 1. And so our first full quarter will actually be this guide I'm giving you now. I thought it would be useful to provide the guide for the fiscal second quarter, inclusive of Putnam, but I will call out the individual components. Putnam, you can see that we're being disciplined with our expenses around Franklin and being transparent about the difference between Franklin and expenses and Putnam additions. So I mentioned the EFR already being in the high 38s excluding any sort of one-off episodic revenue. In terms of compensation and benefits, assuming a $50 million performance fee quarter, including Putnam, we'd expect total comp and benefits to be approximately $815 million. This includes $65 million of comp and benefits for Putnam. Just for further perspective, we expect to be able to bring that down to about $50 million to $55 million by the end of the fiscal year. Again, this assumes $50 million of performance fees. Information Systems and Technology, we expect to be $155 million for the quarter, this includes $25 million for Putnam, and we expect to bring that $25 million down to between $15 million and $20 million by the time we reach the end of our fiscal year. Occupancy, we expect to be approximately $80 million. Recall in the last call, I mentioned that we're going to have a period of double rent based on our consolidation of New York City office space of $12 million.  Last quarter, I mentioned $8 million, but that was only for a short quarter in terms of how long we're -- 2 months out of the 3 for the double rent. This time, we have for 3 months, which is $12 million for the double rent and $10 million for Putnam in this context. I wouldn't guide $10 million down yet because we're still working on real estate optimization.  And for G&A, we expect the consolidated amount to be $175 million, which includes $35 million for Putnam. We expect this to come down to about $30 million by the time we reached the end of the fiscal year. In terms of what this means for annual guide, you'll recall that in the last guide we gave, I mentioned that our fiscal 2024 at the -- then levels of markets and revenue expectations was expected to be about flat to 2023.  Excluding Putnam, and excluding performance fees and excluding the double rent in New York City, I would now guide that amount, which excludes Putnam to about 1% to 2% higher, but that's because we now anticipate all else from any of -- that revenue would be 5% higher for the year, including Putnam and excluding performance fees, but including the $50 million of double rent. We would currently expect total adjusted operating expenses for fiscal '24 to be about $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion. And for perspective, this assumes the Putnam expenses addition to this is about $375 million to $380 million.  In terms of the EFR, back to your first question, for the year, inclusive of Putnam because Putnam has a slightly lower effective fee rate, it brings the overall amount down to -- down about 0.2 basis points. So it brings the number for the guide for the year to about the mid-38, mid- to slightly better than mid-38. This excludes any catch-up fees, episodic fees on performance fees, as I mentioned at the beginning. Alexander Blostein : Great. Okay. I think I got all of that or most of it, and I'm sure folks will follow up as well. I guess my only other follow-up for you. I think we talked about Putnam being around $150 million contribution to operating income on exit run rate. Can we just get an update on where that stands now? Obviously, their asset base is a little bit higher as well, but just want to get a sense whether $150 million is still kind of the run rate number we should be thinking about by the end of your fiscal year. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. So just to break that down further, so I'll start the call with all these numbers. But just to break this down a little bit further. So in terms of revenue, obviously, we don't normally guide revenue, but we want to be useful in terms of modeling purposes for the second quarter, again, fiscal second quarter, Putnam revenues stand-alone would be about $160 million. Of that, $135 million is management fee revenue and $25 million is in the other revenue item, that's for the TA basically. We would have said between $85 million and $100 million of expenses in the first 9 months, so through our fiscal year, $85 million to $100 million. And by the time we reach the end of 9, 30th, at the end of our fiscal, yes, our expense savings for the full 2025 would be at least $150 million. This translates to get specifically to your question around operating income addition, Alex. This translates into probably between $150 million and $170 million of operating income contribution from the transaction. In terms of how we think this translates into. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts below the line, but how this translates into accretion dilution, it's probably just very slightly accretive, maybe one centers about that. In the second fiscal quarter, so the first fiscal quarter that we'd have on Putnam it's accretive right away.  And by the time we reach the full year, it's probably near high single digit cents accretion and that translates into about a 3% accretive situation for full year '24. Remembering that's only 9 months of Putnam that's where we expect things to be. Assuming revenue stays where it is today, and markets stay where they are today and so on. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : My question is on the alternatives net flow trajectory. If we back out the 2 flagship fundraisers at Lexington and Benefit Street, there would have been a large swing in net flows over the last 12 to 18 months. So I wanted your perspective on the flow trajectory in terms of net flows from alts. And are you expecting other funds to kind of step up and fill in that gap? Jennifer Johnson : Thanks, Craig. So in the last 2 years, we have had about $40 billion in fundraising for our private markets. That was offset a bit by $12 billion in net outflows in the liquid alternatives. That just gives you a little bit of perspective there. We anticipate this year of fundraising between $10 billion and $15 billion in the private markets. And I would expect in this environment to have that translate into alternative asset revenue growth that's at the mid-single digits.  So far, in Q1, you've probably seen that we raised $5 billion in the private markets and that between closing of Lexington's flagship fund and BSP. In the same period, we had about $1.1 billion in net outflows in the liquid alts. Just to kind of look forward for the rest of the year, we can't talk about specific funds. But the areas that we think there's strong interest is alternative credit, specifically like direct lending, we see interest both in the U.S. and Europe. There's opportunities in the alternative credit in special situations, opportunistic real estate debt as well as CLOs.  And just on that real estate debt point, as you see less and less of the regional banks having retracted in that space, we think there's both an opportunity to do very well there and strong client interest in that space. With respect to secondary, just as a reminder, Lexington does a lot more than just their flagship offering. They have offerings in middle market and co-invest offerings. 2023 was the third consecutive year where secondary industry surpassed the $100 billion in the fund raise, and we think that, that -- there just continues to be strong demand. And just again, a supply demand issue that keeps feeds very high, where you had $6 trillion deployed in private equity and only, say, $150 billion deployed in secondaries and strong demand by the LPs and GPs because of liquidations being down and distributions being down to have a portion of their secondary portfolios picked up.  With respect to real estate, our 3 largest funds at Clarion are perpetually fundraising. We see opportunities to continue to expand in Europe. And then we're incredibly excited about the success that we had in the wealth channel with Lexington, where 20% of the fund raise of Lex 10 fund came from the wealth channel. And this has been years of building up our capabilities with the FT alternatives where we built both a team of specialists, the 30-plus specialists to help assist our wholesaling team.  We've leveraged our academy to not only educate our own force, but also to help our distribution partners educate their advisers on how to think about this. And so it's a lot of years in the making, and we're really excited to see it come together with this fundraise. But that same expertise is going to be very helpful in both private credit as well as real estate. Adam Spector : And Jenny, I would add 2 things in terms of the momentum we've had in the wealth channel. One is the success we've had to date with things like Lexington, mean that we're able to now have more meaningful conversations with our distribution partners about calendar placement many quarters into the future, which really helps us plan our product launches.  At the same time, we're now in a position where our distribution partners want to work with us to co-create products. So we're working on doing that together so that the products we come to market with in the wealth management channel are meeting their needs. The final item is that a lot of our success to date has been in the U.S. market in terms of wealth management, and we're now building out our specialist capabilities, our education, our academy, et cetera, in markets outside of the U.S. where we hope to have a similar level of success in the wealth management channels there. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Katz from TD Cowen. William Katz : So first question, maybe switch up the conversation a little bit, just talk about capital. You announced a pretty sizable repurchase authorization, have some equity that you have issued in consent with the transaction of Putnam. Looking at your balance sheet, it looks like you're saying about sort of net cash of 0 if you sort of adjust for the debt. How should we be thinking about maybe the tempo or pacing of capital deployment or buyback as we think through the year? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Bill. I'll take that. And then, Jenny, maybe you'd like to comment also. So as usual, Bill, we're focused on making sure that we maintain our dividend and the same trajectory that's been on since the 1980s. We are very focused on organic growth investments. There is a ton going on, as you all know, in the industry. And there's a lot of call on capital for internal growth and internal projects and investments. So they're our 2 most important things.  Then we've got debt service coming up this year are $250 million. Obviously, if the market becomes more reasonably priced in terms of debt, perhaps we access the debt markets at the end of the year or stuff like that. But we want to position ourselves to be able to pay that debt down with our cash. We're absolutely going to hedge our employee grants as we always explain.  And then what I'd say is that -- and this is sort of the interplay between M&A and share repurchases. We've been very active, obviously, as you know, in terms of M&A to make sure we've got the right strategies at both institutional and retail and so on as we've discussed extensively. And when that slows down, which it has done for us, we've got 1 or 2 more payments in the next 1 to 2 years in terms of M&A. But once that's done, we'll be in a position where the M&A we look at is even much more strategic involving shares like we've done with Putnam, Great-West Life, for example, or it's involving much smaller M&A transactions to fill in gaps, a few gaps that we've got.  And that means we can be more opportunistic with our share repurchases. And as you've seen from the last couple of quarters, we certainly picked that up a little bit. But the backdrop is complicated, market's quite volatile and a lot going on globally that influences the market. So we're constantly assessing that backdrop. But I would say that we would hope what else remaining equal to move into more of a capital return position as we've demonstrated, both with dividend and share repurchase over the last couple of quarters in the future versus just being very much focused on M&A. William Katz : Okay. That's super helpful. And just as a follow-up, Jenny, perhaps for yourself or Matt, or Adam. Any sense or can you give us an update on how the insurance mandates are -- the momentum is building there. I think there was some $20-odd billion that should flow in. So once the deal has been completed, and then how you think about the backlog behind that? And maybe the broader question underneath that is what are the early stage discussions with the enhanced distribution opportunity now that the transaction is complete? Jennifer Johnson : Well, so I mean, obviously, we have the $25 billion that we've talked about with Great-West Life, and that will come in kind of through the year. And it's a mix of multiple our SIMs with the bulk of it actually going to Western, but goes -- it has alternatives in there. And as well as fixed income and equity. And we announced that we're going to be a sub-adviser [indiscernible] And part of that is because we -- when we acquired Western, we acquired real expertise in understanding the insurance space, and we've been able to leverage that capability more broadly. But Adam, you want to talk about some additional things that you're seeing. Adam Spector : Okay. I would say just in terms of scale, our insurance business is about $170 billion now, and that's not including the flows we've talked about from the power-related companies. So it's a very significant business. As Jenny said, to be successful in a lot of the general account area, you've not only need to have investment expertise, but really insurance, domain-specific expertise, technology compliance.  We're one of the few firms we think to combine both of those. And then the partnership with Power Corp. has also allowed us to co-create products with them that we think will be very successful in the marketplace, and you're seeing some launches there as well. The team there has been -- Putnam has been very successful in the DC channel as well as in insurance. And we think bringing those salespeople on to our team now that they have a wider array of products to sell will really hockey stick our efforts there as well. Matthew Nicholls : And just a little bit more perspective on the $25 billion, Bill, just to be clear. But right now, for all intents purposes, for modeling purposes, we don't have any of that in. I mean we have a little bit, but it's not really nothing's really hit the revenue line yet. We expect, as Jenny mentioned, about 2/3 of this to be kind of investment grade and a little bit emerging market and other corporate credit across a broad range of our specialist investment managers. As you think about modeling, I think it's probably appropriate to think about the effective fee rate being in the mid-teens. I think Jenny mentioned that as a whole. This will likely to begin in earnest later on this quarter that we're in now. So kind of March time, maybe March, April, that sort of thing. And of course, we will update you when we have large inflows associated with this, we will provide that context and make sure we're transparent with you about when that comes in. But just to be clear, beyond the $25 billion, we expect to grow -- there's a lot of opportunities to grow beyond the $25 billion. And even with this, we're just alongside other asset managers that also have important relationships with the Power group of companies. So we're just alongside them. We're increasing market share, frankly, where it should be aligned with what we -- the capabilities regarding the size of our franchise. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : A couple of clarifications. Matt, I just want to confirm the 1Q guide for comp that was, I believe, $815 million around that included $50 million of performance fees. Did the full year guide of the $455 million to $466 million assume a $50 million a quarter performance fee contribution? Matthew Nicholls : Yes, plus the $93 million that we had this -- in the first quarter. So it's $93 million, $50 million, $50 million, $50 million. Daniel Fannon : Yes. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the Lexington what's happened -- I'd like to just clarify what's in the numbers now in terms of AUM and flows that we've seen as of 12/31. And then in terms of catch-up fees, we got the disclosure for this quarter and last, but should we assume given the final close in January, another round of catch-up fees here for the March quarter? Matthew Nicholls : So there's no more catch-up fees to book at this point. The fund had its last fundraising in the -- by 12/31 and that's when they sent the press release out that indicated that we have $22.7 billion of additional AUM. And that's all included in our reported numbers. Daniel Fannon : And the would BSP's fundraise be in there as well? 12/31? Matthew Nicholls : No, not yet. Operator : The next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : So you spoke earlier about fixed income and the attractiveness and demand and a shift from cash and short duration investments. What are you specifically seeing as far as RFP activity? And could you talk about Western and their level of engagement with their client base? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So Brennan, maybe just a little bit of color kind of on the industry everybody talked about the $7.7 trillion in money market funds and what's going to be transferring from cash into other investments. And first of all, Western's money market fund is primarily institutional and institutions tend to build in the first 2 quarters and then spend in the second 2 quarters.  Having said that, and we don't have a meaningful presence in the retail money market business. However, obviously, we have relationships with those distributors, which we do that's where you're going to capture the transition. So even if you don't have the money market plus, it doesn't mean you get the transition. So we've had actually good interest and positive flows in some categories in our fixed income. Unfortunately, it's masked. It's masked a bit by some performance challenges we've had in the core strategies. Over half of our top 10 gross selling funds are in the fixed income space. And actually, from a vehicle standpoint, were positive flows in ETFs and muni ladder SMAs. So it's really important to think about this as being vehicle-agnostic. And our fixed income gross sales are up 8%. We've had the greatest portion of our institutional pipeline is actually fixed income in multisector credit, high-yield, global income and Western, to your question about Western, they represent the largest portion of that.  So Western is having good conversations or clients -- been -- have a lot of very good performing strategies but have struggled, obviously, in their core strategy. Global [indiscernible] positive in things like tax efficient, global opportunistic, [indiscernible]  back securities. But I think the most -- and by the way, Putnam brings in really top-performing fixed income performance as well plus additional products and things like stable value, ultrashort duration, intermediate core and really the performance in munis as well.  So we think cash is still attractive. And frankly, some people would argue the risk reward, you got cash yielding 5% and same high yield, yielding 7.5%, that you're not going to see the full rotation until you see some rate cuts as opposed to just peaking. And we just think we're incredibly well positioned, both in public fixed income, traditional fixed income as well as private credit to be able to capture this. And our view is what we're seeing is it demonstrates that we're well positioned there. I don't know, Adam, if you want to add anything? Adam Spector : Yes. Jenny, I would just add that I think you're spot on that we've really seen strength in a number of areas of fixed income that was masked by some of the outflows in Core and Core Plus. But the performance in Core and Core Plus turned around. If you take a look at the end of the year, Core is up 37 basis points in the index, Core Plus 124. And traditionally, those products get very, very strong inflows after the Fed stops hiking. So we're in the position now from a performance standpoint as well as in the rate cycle, where those products are poised to do quite well. Brennan Hawken : Great. And then just, Matthew, I wanted to reconfirm because a lot of times when you speak to expenses, you speak to it ex some items, but it sounds like the $4.55 billion and the $4.6 billion for the fiscal quarter would be inclusive of the double rent would also include the expectation -- the actual performances from this past quarter plus [ 50 ] expected the next few as well as the 9 months of Putnam. Do I have that correct? Matthew Nicholls : That's right. Yes. And just to -- the reason why I went through the detail is because I want to be very clear that if you take Putnam out of the equation, our expenses are up like 1% or something like that year-over-year. And that's only because -- and again, we don't normally talk about revenue on -- from a guide perspective, it's almost impossible to guide, as you know. But that does assume 5% higher revenue. So just if you often people ask us about margin, the relationship between revenue and expenses and leverage and operating leverage in the system -- well you can see that if we expect revenue to go up 5%, we only expect our expenses to go up between 1% and 2% on a foundational level. And then in addition to that, we're adding Putman. But of course, we're in the process of reducing expenses around the Putnam acquisition. That's when you get to all these -- when you put all that together, you get to the $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion. Next year, we expect that to be a further reduction in expenses. I mentioned $375 million for 9 months of expenses for Putnam, we expect on a dollar-for-dollar basis for that to come down for 2025. I said to you that for the year, we expect to actually realize $85 million to $100 million of expenses, expense savings from the Putnam transaction. For a full year, that's $150 million at least in expense savings, and that's what translates into about $150 million to $170 million of operating income addition. Brennan Hawken : Yes. That's -- that $150 million, that's the run rate when you exit your fiscal year basically right? Matthew Nicholls : That's exactly right. Yes. So on the last day, at the very least on the -- I think we could be a little bit better than this. But on the last day, [ 9, 30 ] when you times that number of savings by the year, it's $150 million at least. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : I wanted to ask about retirement with Putnam and the Great-West strategic relationship, this accelerates your push into the retirement channel. I hope you could talk about some of the steps you're taking and may take over the next 12 months to capture the growth opportunity that you see. Maybe you could elaborate on that as well as which products you think might resonate the most. Jennifer Johnson : Adam, you want to take that? Adam Spector : Yes. So first of all, the Putnam acquisition gave us capabilities. And I think those capabilities are really important in terms of things like stable value where there's $18 billion in assets, ultrashort and target date. If you take a look at target date, it's a third of industry DC AUM right now, had $150 billion in net flow last year. We can now play in that segment where we haven't really been able to play effectively historically.  So from a product standpoint, we're in a much stronger position. I would also say that from a sales force position, when we took folks in from Putnam, one of the areas where we added most significantly within that retirement and somewhat in the insurance channel as well. So we just have a much, much larger field force. So that lets us be better partners both of those things, both the expanded field force, the expanded products. We're better partners with the power-related companies, but with all of our insurance partners. And I think that's what's really important to mention is this is not just about being stronger with one partner, it's about being stronger in insurance and retirement across the board.  Putnam's DC assets are about 30% of overall AUM. It's just a real strength in bringing that DNA into Franklin will be a real benefit in the relationship with Empower allows us to build some custom products together that we can go to market with that we think will really help us win because we can have multiple sales forces now selling the same products, which just gives us leverage. Michael Cyprys : Great. And just a follow-up question on the technology front. Just curious how you're thinking about front to back outsourcing opportunities and evolving the tech stack from here. Maybe you could speak to some of the opportunities that you might see from improving data integration across the multiple systems that you have, what sort of factors go into consideration? And any sort of lessons learned you might take away from others that have partnered externally on this front. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, Mike, I'll take that and then Jenny, maybe would like to comment. Because we're all very involved in these very critical decisions for the company. So as you know, we outsourced transfer agency, fund administration and parts of that technology, as we've described beforehand. We then moved on to understanding the potential opportunity for effectively partnering with one single provider for our investment technology platform.  That's a huge undertaking a process that takes a year, 18 months just to go through all the analysis. What I'd say on this is the #1 point is and most important to us, candidly, is that all of our specialist investment teams are on board with moving to a single investment technology platform. We've done a huge amount of work, and I'd say that we are close to deciding on who that partner should be.  It's going to be a long time to implement. I wish it was faster, but it's slower. It's a very long and complicated process. We're probably going to take something like 3 years to implement. So to give you guide on expense reductions and how it's going to be applied internally is really premature at this stage. But we are encouraged by what we see and what we think we can achieve from this transaction. But candidly, there's so many other demands to invest like artificial intelligence, data, additional teams and resources that they require to be leading in the industry, that while we expect long-term savings to be meaningful over time, we've got a lot of other things to circulate those savings into.  But again, we'll share that with you when we're through the process with the partner that we expect to announce here in the coming quarter or 2 or so. So that's sort of the update and whether Jen, do you want to add anything to that? Jennifer Johnson : No, Matt, that was perfect. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Patrick Davitt : First, on Putnam, as we try to kind of level set our model expectations. Could you give an update on how the net flow picture tracked from announcement through the December quarter with and without reinvested dividends. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Excluding reinvested dividends, it's slightly positive. No, obviously, we closed the transaction, as you know, Patrick, on January 1, I'd say, in the quarter before that and the period we're in now, it's kind of flattish, excluding reinvested dividends. So slightly positive. Jennifer Johnson : And I'm just going to throw one thing in. I mean Putnam's got 85% of their AUM beating their peers in all time periods. 87% of mutual funds are -- or 91% of mutual funds are rated 4- and 5-star ratings. So both on the equity and fixed income, they've got phenomenal performance. Patrick Davitt : Great. And then one housekeeping item. It wasn't clear to me earlier when you were talking about this, but the $5.5 billion-ish win from Great-West announced last week, is that a part of the $25 billion? Or should we consider it incremental? Unknown Executive : Incremental. Jennifer Johnson : Yes. I think that's from the -- yes, from the retirement channel. So. Patrick Davitt : So it is incremental. Unknown Executive : Incremental. Operator : And the next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just one clarification also. I think I'm not sure you mentioned this, but the alternative was I think the $5 billion of private markets to play with them correctly, $5 billion of private markets, less about $1 billion of liquid also is that for the quarter just reported or for the current month quarter. Jennifer Johnson : Well, so BSP -- so they closed their fund in this quarter. And so you don't see those flows in last quarter. So we're talking about in Matt, what was the date that they closed the [ 4.7 ]. Matthew Nicholls : Like a week ago... Jennifer Johnson : This quarter. So -- and just the different BSP charges when they call capital, so they don't have catch-up fees like Lexington does. Brian Bedell : Yes. Perfect. Okay. That's clear. And then just more broadly, I guess, just the ETF franchise are growing nicely. Maybe Jenny, if you want to -- and Adam also or Matt, just talk a bit about the -- your long-term vision for active semitransparent ETFs, you've already got 12 managers, using these products to $20 billion in the total ETF, which of course, includes a lot of smart beta. But just how you're thinking about this over, say, the next 2 or 3 years the demand from the marketplace for ETFs, but whether you think it might cannibalize mutual funds where you actually think you can develop strategies that will be incrementally growing sales on top of your mutual fund tranches? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So I think the key to think about with ETFs and frankly, SMAs A lot of the growth is driven from the fact that the world has moved more towards fee-based and how distribution fees are paid and things like traditional mutual funds. And then obviously, the tax efficiencies and ETFs. So we view it as our expertise is our investment -- risk-adjusted investment capabilities, risk-adjusted returns. We have a very small passive suite in the ETFs, but we really focus on active management. And we are agnostic to the vehicle in which we deliver that. So we look at the ETF as a vehicle which works really well in certain channels.  And on the wealth side, you're starting to see more growth internationally in ETFs, more discussions like in places I just came from Asia, where you haven't seen the kind of penetration there, but they're interested in them. And then things like SMAs are also very much growing in the wealth channel. And we look at Canvas as a great way to bring tax optimization to the SMA platform. So that it can be leveraged as a tool to provide tax-efficient active SMAs to the market. We've had close to $1 billion in a quarter in flows in the ETFs. I think we're now over $21 billion when we've added Putnam into that and have had really great success diversifying our strategies into these other types of vehicles. So the Franklin Income Fund, now we have the Franklin Income-focused ETF, which has again been really well received in the market since it was launched as well as having traction outside the U.S.  So ETFs are incredibly important to us. Yes, it will probably cannibalize some of the mutual funds. But for -- in our case, where we have been underpenetrated in the areas of retirement, that's actually been an area where the tax benefit of ETFs hasn't made a difference, and you're seeing very strong support from mutual funds to the retirement channel. So as we grow there, we're able to make up for any of that cannibalization in that retirement channel while also growing our ETFs.  So Adam, do you want to add anything to that? Adam Spector : Yes. I would just reiterate the point that, for us, ETFs is about the vehicle, not about being passive, just to put some numbers around that 24% of our assets are smart beta and 36% are active. So our passive ETF business, it's only 40% of our AUM is in passive and it was only 20% -- passive was only 20% of our ETF flow for the quarter. So as more and more people begin to consider active management within an ETF wrapper, we think that's great to us.  And to the point about cannibalization, we would also say that direct indexing is the real threat to mutual funds, and that's where we're so thrilled to have Canvas on board to see the growth there to see our ability to actually use Canvas to manage active portfolios now as well. We think that puts us in a very good position. Jennifer Johnson : And I think that Canvas is [indiscernible] is more of a threat to the passive mutual fund that has and passive ETF. Matthew Nicholls : We had another question come in to clarify a point around guidance on performance fees. So just to be clear, the [ 815 ] guide that I gave around the fiscal second quarter guidance, includes an assumption of $50 million of performance fees. The annual guide of $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion is excluding performance fees. Just as you know, we always give our annual guide excluding performance fees. I just want to be clear on that. That's fully inclusive of Putnam. It includes the double rent, but it excludes performance fees. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO for final comments. Jennifer Johnson : Great. Well, thank you, everybody, for participating in today's call. And once again, I just want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to be able to deliver this quarter. And we look forward to speaking to you all again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Chief Communications Officer and Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. I'm joined by Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution.  We'll answer your questions in just a few minutes. But first, I'd like to review some highlights from the quarter. In terms of public equity markets, 2023 was, to some extent, a tale of 2 markets, the Magnificent Seven and the S&P 493 with the former contributing the lion's share of returns. So far in 2024, in the public equity markets, we've seen a significant dispersion emerge in performance among the Magnificent Seven, leading to a better environment for fundamental research to capture alpha and when augmented by robust risk management can deliver compelling portfolio results for clients. Given the current backdrop, we believe equity allocation should, in general, tilt towards sectors and regions that are being overlooked due to the heavy concentration in the largest companies. In addition, the theme of artificial intelligence will likely continue to be a significant stock driver, both positive and negative for the haves and have-nots over time. Meanwhile, on interest rates, consensus estimates currently indicate a notable decrease in the number of expected cuts for 2024 by the Federal Reserve from 6 to now 2. Fed speak increasingly signals openness to delaying rate cuts to later in the second half of this year on the back of improving economic growth and slower disinflation. Against this background, while cash may continue to look attractive in the very near term, fixed income opportunities will likely provide a better total return option over high-yield and cash equivalents as the cutting cycle commences. Looking at private markets, secular trends and macro tailwinds continue to create opportunities in alternative credit, secondary private equity and select areas of real estate. In addition, investor demand for private market exposure is increasing given its diversification benefits, potential for higher risk-adjusted returns and as a hedge against inflation. Broadly speaking, these signals point to a complex market environment that creates opportunities for active managers. This quarter, my executive team and I had the opportunity to travel extensively outside the U.S. to meet with many of our key clients to hear firsthand what is top of mind and how Franklin Templeton can better serve them. As a global active manager with $1.6 trillion in assets under management and operating in 35 countries around the world, we believe that Franklin Templeton is positioned to take advantage of the money in motion by assisting our clients with a broad range of investment capabilities across public and private assets in vehicles of choice. We were also pleased to learn that our clients recognize the steps we have taken over the past few years to further diversify and strengthen our presence in important markets and distribution channels outside the U.S. We, again, saw aggregate positive net flows in non-U.S. regions, which now have approximately $490 billion in assets under management. Furthermore, a number of our clients continue to progress toward working with fewer asset managers and in this regard, expect not only a broad range of investment capabilities, but also other services, including technology, portfolio construction, customization and thought leadership. At Franklin Templeton, we leverage the skills of multiple specialist investment managers to deliver expertise across a wide range of investment styles and asset classes. Our investment teams benefit from Franklin Templeton's scale, with centralized investments in content, technology, data and most recently, artificial intelligence where we're excited about collaborating with leaders in technology on AI platforms. Moreover, the diversity of our model benefits our corporate shareholders, given that no single specialist investment manager at our firm represents more than 12% of adjusted operating revenue and most of our specialist investment managers are diversified within themselves as well. Turning to highlights from the quarter. Ending AUM increased by 13% to $1.64 trillion from the prior quarter and increased by 16% from the prior year quarter due to the addition of Putnam as well as positive markets and net inflows. Average AUM increased by 13% and 11% to $1.58 trillion from the prior quarter and the prior year quarter, respectively. Investment performance continues to be strong and resulted in 62%, 51%, 62% and 69% of our strategy composite AUM outperforming their respective benchmarks on a 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year basis, benefiting from the addition of Putnam.  In terms of mutual funds, investment performance resulted in 51%, 60%, 44% and 56% of mutual fund AUM outperforming their peers on a 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year basis, and performance strengthened versus peers across the 3-, 5- and 10-year time periods quarter-over-quarter. Our long-term net flows were $6.9 billion in the quarter, including reinvested distributions of $3.1 billion and $13.7 billion was funded out of the $25 billion allocation from Great-West. Long-term net inflows were spread across asset classes, investment vehicles and geographies. Fixed income, multi-asset and alternative assets led the way from an asset class perspective and we continue to see growth in our separately managed account, ETF and Canvas offerings. Each have achieved at least 4 consecutive quarters of net inflows and all are at record high AUM. Long-term inflows of $85 billion increased by 23% from the prior quarter and 37% from the prior year quarter. Excluding reinvested distributions, which are seasonally elevated in the prior quarter and inflows from Great-West, long-term inflows increased by 17% from the prior quarter and 15% from the prior year quarter. In terms of flows by asset class, fixed income net inflows were $8.3 billion, we saw client interest reflected in positive net flows into core bond highly customized corporate bond, multi-sector municipal and high-yield strategies. Equity net outflows were $5.3 billion. We saw positive net flows into large-cap value and smart beta. Excluding reinvested distributions, which are seasonally elevated in the prior quarter, equity net outflows improved by 29% from the prior quarter. Multi-asset net inflows were $2.9 billion, driven by Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, the Franklin Income Fund and Canvas, our custom indexing solution platform. Alternative net inflows were $1 billion, driven by growth in the private market strategies, which were partially offset by outflows in liquid alternative strategies. Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington Partners each had net inflows in the current quarter with a combined total of $1.4 billion. As we mentioned last quarter, in January, Lexington Partners closed its latest flagship global secondary fund with $22.7 billion of total capital commitments.  Fund 10 ranks among the largest funds raised to date and significantly exceeded Lexington's private secondary fund, which closed with $14 billion in 2020, and we were delighted that approximately 20% of the capital raised in the fund came from the wealth management channel. Also in January, Benefit Street Partners closed its 5th flagship private credit fund with $4.7 billion of total capital commitments, reflecting the strong demand for the asset class, BSP exceeded its fundraising target. We believe the current market opportunity and backdrop for U.S. direct lending and alternative credit in general is attractive, and BSP has significant underwriting experience, loan structuring expertise and focus on deep due diligence, which provides us with a competitive advantage.  In the wealth management channel, alternatives by Franklin Templeton has increased the number of product offerings and expanded platform placements, increasing market share and growing our client base. Our distribution force of more than 350 individual partners with our 50% group of alternative asset specialists to educate financial advisers and their clients on the potential benefits of private market investing. We expect a busy next 12 months across private markets. From an investment vehicle perspective, ETF AUM ended the quarter at $24 billion and generated net inflows of approximately $1.6 billion representing another quarter of net inflows exceeding $1 billion and the tenth consecutive quarter of positive net flows. SMA AUM ended the quarter at $138 billion and generated positive net flows of nearly $3 billion, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of net inflows.  Canvas generated net inflows of over $750 million with a robust pipeline and AUM increasing by 23% from the prior quarter to over $7 billion. Investment Solutions leverages our capabilities across public and private asset classes to pursue strategic partnerships. This quarter, Investment Solutions generated positive net flows with assets under management of over $75 billion, including the addition of Putnam. This quarter, our institutional pipeline of one but unfunded mandates was $20 billion, a significant increase from the prior quarter and does not include the remaining allocation from Great-West Lifeco. The pipeline is one of the strongest it's been and remains diversified by asset class and across our specialist investment managers. With the close of our acquisition of Putnam on January 1, we are a $1.64 trillion investment manager. We've been pleased with the positive reaction from our clients and in the quarter, Putnam contributed positive net flows and its AUM increased by 8% to $160 billion or 18% since our announcement in May last year. With our expanded capabilities, our AUM in the insurance and retirement channels now exceeds $650 billion. Putnam's investment performance continued to be strong, with 89% or higher of mutual fund AUM outperforming peers in the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods and 91% of mutual fund AUM in funds that are rated 4 or 5 star by Morningstar. We were also thrilled to see that Barron's ranked Putnam the #1 fund family for 1- and 5-year performance and #5 for the 10-year period. Since the closing, we're also pleased to see that Putnam's average monthly gross sales has increased by approximately 30%, demonstrating the strength of Franklin Templeton's distribution.  Turning briefly to financial results. Adjusted operating income was $419.6 million, an increase of 0.6% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 4.7% from the prior year quarter. As always, we continue to focus on disciplined expense management, while also continuing to invest in growth and innovation for the benefits of our clients and shareholders. Before I turn the call over to you for your questions, I would like to thank our employees for their many contributions and always staying laser-focused on our clients' financial future. Now let's open it up to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] One moment for your first question which will be from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : First, we have a big picture net flow question. Lots of ins and outs in the $7 billion, especially with the $14 billion and from -- Great-West. So how should we think about the core net flow run rate if we back the $14 billion out of the $7 billion of long-term net flows? Jennifer Johnson : So Craig, thanks for the question. Let me -- let me answer that question in first, kind of how we're positioning ourselves, and I will -- I promise you, I will get to those points and Adam can add some additional cover -- color. So -- the way we're positioned the firm, I think of it as in 4 key secular trends that has driven our acquisition strategy and what we think will drive flows now and in the future. So the first obviously is our movement to alternatives. We think that it's not going away, private credit is here to stay, banks are going to lend the same way that they've done in the past, private equity is here to stay. And so if you look at our breadth of capabilities from Lexington, Clarion, BSP, Alcentra we think we have the broadest alternatives capability of any traditional asset manager. And from a flow standpoint, obviously well known in the institutional space, what's really important is that the -- in the wealth channel, there's a desire to go from about a 5% allocation to a 15% allocation. And what's significant there, if you just take the 4 biggest wire houses a 1% increase in allocation is $130 billion. And what we're excited about is that as we mentioned in the prior comments and opening comments, Lexington's that fundraise was in the wealth channel. And believe me, that was years of learning starts and stops in blocking and tackling, learning about education, educating our own team, educating the advisers who are selling to be able to be successful in that. And we think we can take that same strategy with any of our alternatives. The second -- I'm going to name 4 of them. The second is just customization. You're seeing from technology advances that clients want either specific vehicles or the portfolios to be customized. And so if you look at this quarter's trends, things like our SMA, which is positive, Legg Mason made us a top 3 SMA provider. You're seeing more and more flows going into SMAs, ETFs, while we were late arguably to the passive ETF space, we were actually early in the active ETF space. And today, at our $24 billion in ETFs, the largest category is actually active ETFs. And we're seeing that in markets like Europe, where the regulatory environment has changed, there's a greater demand now for ETFs. And we're having success in our like green bond and Paris Alliance. So a lot of the ESG ETFs are doing very well in Europe. And then finally, in kind of that customization vehicle being -- vehicle [indiscernible] is the direct indexing. And not only we're seeing positive flows consistently with Canvas. But we added 11 new partners to the 88 partners that we have with Canvas. And once you get embedded in -- from the -- in the pipes, you continue to see flow. So it's just a great opportunity.  But I think what gets us most excited about Canvas is the fact that as you're seeing this trend towards greater SMAs, Canvas was built as a technology platform. Some of the direct indexing were more about people who focused on tax optimization. This is truly a technology platform. So we can see taking traditional active portfolios of being able to tax optimize as well as tilting. And you have to have the right technology for that. The third big trend, I think, is really global distribution. You have 1 billion people that are entering the middle class, 87% of those are in Asia. And so we've got that massive global distribution. We were in Taiwan in 1985. We were the first foreign manager in India. We have local asset management capabilities in emerging markets like in the Middle East, China, India, Brazil as well as local capabilities in a lot of developed markets. And so we think we're really uniquely positioned to take advantage of that trend. And as a matter of fact, this quarter, you saw non-U.S. flows were positive outside the U.S. And then the fourth and, obviously, really important is the technology and technological advances. And that's where I would say, I think the players -- so far, if you play the AI move, you've been playing in the picks and shovels of artificial intelligence, it's going to be the firms that really figure out how to make this work for them to make it a competitive advantage that's important. You'll hear it about an announcement later this week where we are announcing a strategic partnership on some AI work that we're doing with one of those big players. And then the secondary is blockchain. And we came out with a tokenized first one to have a 40 Act shareholder system on the public blockchain. We came out with the tokenized money market fund in 2021. So the first to do that, we are actually a node validator in the space with 11 different nodes. It's an area we know well, and we think it's going to be really significant. We announced a partnership with a UAE-based firm to leverage -- they're going to leverage our blockchain technology, shareholder servicing systems to launch a stable coin, and we'll be managing the portfolio there. So as you bring those together, now to answer your question, it's going to be -- it's about execution, right? And I could tell you, I think we found it was probably -- it's a challenge when you take -- you do 10 different acquisitions and you're trying to choose best athlete for your distribution team, and we genuinely believe we put together the best team, but there are headwinds to that where you get a new wholesaler in a region and you've broken relationships maybe with the prior wholesalers clients. And so it takes time to build those relationships back. But we feel like we're really seeing that pay off this quarter. You see it in our pipeline, I mean, to go from $13 billion to $20 billion and not have -- that's not any Great-West Life. That's just good, solid wins in the pipeline growth. Interesting statistic is our core sales, and we define core sales, sales less than $100 million. So these are the ones that just -- you get on an adviser's platform and they continue to just allocate to you. So excluding Putnam, those are up 14%. And again, those are where that wholesalers out there meeting and so a good success there. And then if you look at inflows, excluding reinvested distributions Great-West Life, they're up 17%. So we're positive in all those vehicles, we're positive outside the U.S. where we've got good pipeline strength. And then you take a firm like Putnam. And this is where we've talked about this, and I think you see it with Putnam, where the big distribution companies or big distributors are saying they want to consolidate the number of partners. And so you take a Putnam, we've actually grown Putnam sales by 30% since the acquisition. And that's just really, in some cases, where we're a preferred partner with a distributor, and they weren't and now they get the benefit of being part of that preferred partnership. It's where our 350-plus client-facing wholesalers can be out there telling the phenomenal story of the performance of the Putnam's funds. And so to see a 30% increase in really the first quarter of Putnam because of bringing it together that distribution is really exciting. So long-winded answer, Craig, but I think we're -- we feel like all that we've put together is coming together in distribution now. Craig Siegenthaler : We're looking forward to seeing your AI announcement later this week. We have a follow-up on outflows. Over the last 8 quarters, we added it up, Franklin had a $13 billion of all inflows. And I know this excludes realizations too. If we add up Lexington $10 million and Benefit Street $5 million. Combined, they add a $27 billion. So all flows look to have been maybe negative $14 billion excess 2 flagship fundraises. So a similar question, but [indiscernible] on the alts business, how should we think about the [indiscernible] net flow trajectory just given that dynamic? Jennifer Johnson : So I think it's -- there's a little bit of noise in the alts numbers. If you just look in calendar year 2022 and 2023, we talked last time about how we raised $40 billion in the private markets. But the reality in our alternatives business, we raised $55 billion, and 80% of it was private markets. But the net change in AUM, you saw $40 billion added to the private markets AUM net, net of realizations, distributions, market, everything. But $16 billion negative in the liquid alts portfolio, which represents about 6% of our alts portfolio now. So that's where you're shifting from much -- the good news is it's the higher fee private markets that have had -- that had solid inflows in that window, but it was a little bit masked by the lower fee liquid alts.  Now fast forward to this -- I'll go this fiscal year. So the first 2 quarters, first of all, we said that we would be raising between $10 billion and $15 billion. That's our goal for the year. We're on track for that. We've raised about $7.3 billion in the private markets and another just under $2 billion in the liquid alts. But if you net out distributions, realizations, FX and market, and to be honest, market -- the only negative market was real estate with Clarion and the others were all positive. We'd say it nets to flat. So again, kind of a gross number there. But if you take away the distributions, realizations and FX, FX was actually pretty significant. Matt could probably give you more details on this, but we netted flat so far in the -- in this fiscal year. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Craig, just for perspective, I'd say, for the last quarter that we're just reporting on, realizations and distributions was $2.6 billion, for example, and we had negative FX of another $1 billion. But we do -- we get these questions, and I think we're going to try and improve our disclosure on this to try and help the question around this. Now we've got the bulk of our alternative assets together. Remembering in previous quarters, we've always said, when we were much smaller, we've always said, look, realizations and distributions just not -- they're just not significant enough to report and break down the explanation of AUM, but they're now getting to the point where we're going to start providing that level of detail. But just for information, the last quarter, again, the one we're reporting almost $2.6 billion of realizations and distributions and $1 billion negative FX. Adam Spector : And Craig, the only thing I would add is that the other thing we've been able to do really is to work more closely with our distribution partners on the wealth management side over the last few quarters and we're able to secure calendar spots further into the future than we ever thought was possible. And I think that speaks well to our future fundraising as well. Operator : Next question will be from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I wanted to talk about fixed income a little bit. So I see pension-funded status is much, much better and rates are higher. I like the $8.3 billion in flows in the quarter, but I don't know how much of that came from Great-West or something else? So maybe you could talk about that. And then bigger picture, is this -- do you feel this is the beginning of a broader trend, the long-awaited fixed income flows, maybe you can give us a little bit of insight from whether it be RFPs, client combos or the consultants on -- if we're at the [indiscernible] of some larger flows into fixed income? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So interestingly, let's face it. As long as people believe rates have peaked and potentially will come down, they're going to go longer duration, right? So the only thing is you're now starting to hear the noise for the first time where actually people think rates may be longer -- higher for longer and somebody was even talking about a potential rate increases. So that could slow things. But let me give you what we're seeing. So we obviously had positive flows, but just looking at the pipeline, and the pipeline doesn't include any Great-West Life. If you add -- well, about 70-plus percent of the growth in the pipeline, is fixed income, and that crosses Western, Franklin and Brandywine. If you actually add BSP because I always think private credit really should be thought of in the fixed income because the decisions around that are often how you're thinking about your fixed income portfolio. The growth in the pipeline, 97% of it comes from fixed income. So 6 of our top 10 gross selling funds in the last -- this past quarter were in fixed income, corporate bond, core bond, multi-sector, munis, highly customized [indiscernible]. So definitely demand in the last quarter. But if you actually look at the pipeline going forward, the institutional pipeline, you see very strong demand for fixed income. Adam Spector : And I would say that it's also pretty broad-based. If you take a look at that funding pipeline, it's really across all 4 of the fixed income firms we have, which all have very significant pipelines right now. And if you take a look at the products we're offering, we're positive in core in high yield and munis was our best-selling segment. So really broad-based fixed income appeal, not just one product. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. And they're also -- last thing I'd say on that is they're also positioned differently in terms of their view on where rates are going. So that means where we've had some performance weaknesses. It's being offset not always fully but being partially offset by strength in other parts of the franchise. Adam Spector : And on the institutional business that you asked about is strong, we're also positive in ETF and SMAs, muni ladders, to lots of different fixed income vehicles doing well for us. Glenn Schorr : Just [indiscernible] follow up on that same topic is have allocations changed a lot? In other words, I hear you on the flows. That's a very bullish commentary for the forward look. But if you took a snapshot of a year ago and 2 year ago allocations to where we are now and maybe 2 years forward, do you think we'll see a major equity fixed income shift? Or I know it's a lot broader than that. But like will fixed income allocations be a lot higher 2 years out? Jennifer Johnson : Again, I think it depends on your view on rates. And as I think Adam or Matt mentioned, you -- our fixed income teams are all kind of spread out as far as their view on where rates go. The frankly, guys probably think a little bit higher for longer Western is probably more aggressively positioned for rate cuts. So I think it really depends on your views. I do think if rates stay higher for longer, it has impacts on returns on equity markets as far as expectations, private markets as well. So Glenn, I think -- again, I think it's going to depend on where people -- where they think they should position our portfolio. I don't know, Adam, do you want to add anything? Adam Spector : Yes. I think it depends on the client, right? You mentioned more fully funded pension plans, right? If we get a wave of more immunization going on, we're going to see that drive fixed income flows. At the same time, really in every channel around the world. What do we see is a move towards alternative. That money is coming out of all of the other traditional buckets. So I think both of those are kind of competing with each other and pushing fixed income allocations in the opposite direction. Operator : Next question will be from Dan Fannon at Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I guess, Matt, maybe we could start with some expense questions. So curious about what the delta was in comp versus your guidance and then as we think about the seasonal impacts of some of this quarter, how much do you expect to roll off as we go into 2Q? And then maybe update us on kind of the full year outlook for expenses. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thank you, Dan. Yes. So a couple of things on expenses around the second quarter, I'll get to the comp and benefits in a second. I'd just like to say that notwithstanding the higher resets around compensation calendar resets around compensation that I'll talk about in a minute and meaningfully higher markets. If you exclude Putnam, which was the main addition we had in the quarter, our expenses would have been flat. So notwithstanding higher performance fees than we expected, higher calendar resets than we expected and higher markets than we expected. Our expenses for the quarter would have been flat when you exclude Putnam. So hopefully, that demonstrates some discipline there. In terms of your specific question around comp and benefits for the second quarter.  The difference is, I said it's around almost half of it is the performance fee, a little bit less than half is performance fee increase relative to where we thought it would be. And then there's these high -- I would say, we were expecting Canada resets their composition, but they're just higher than we thought they'd be. So things like the 401(k), mutual fund units in compensation -- deferred compensation plans, vacation accruals. They were all -- when you add all those things up, plus the performance fee delta, it adds up to about $30 million. So when you add the $30 million to, I think I guided [ $815 million ] on the call, that gets you to pretty much where the [ $844 million ] is where we ended up -- where we ended up. So that explains that part of your question. In terms of the annual guide, last quarter, we guided to $4.6 billion, and that's excluding performance fees, but including the double rent that we've talked about around our New York City consolidation exercise. And I would increase that just slightly to probably $4.6 billion -- $4 billion to $4.65 billion, a very narrow range. So less than 1% higher, and that's really driven by the higher markets that we've experienced. If markets come back down again. as we've been experiencing very recently in the first part of this quarter, it wouldn't surprise me if our annual guide remains flat. But right now, [indiscernible] remaining equal, we expect it to be just slightly higher for the annual guide. Daniel Fannon : Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on that with regards to the effective fee rate I think you had talked about it coming into the mid 38s as the year progressed. So I guess, given where mix is AUM levels, all the dynamics that go into that, how do you see that trending? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thank you for the question. So the EFR for the quarter dropped to 38.5. And I believe that's exactly how we guided for the quarter. And we're able to do that because we had a pretty good feel for the mix that we're coming in, in terms of flows. And I think I also pointed out that we were 1 basis point higher than usual, let's call it, or the effective fee rate for the last quarter was inflated by 1 basis point based on Lexington catch-up fees. Going forward, on an annual basis, I would say that our EFR should remain in the 38s probably in the mid-38s, it will be slightly higher than that, driven by episodic alternative asset fees, as we've experienced over the last 12 months and highlighted those clearly, I think, in our results. And it can -- and the other thing that will help it be higher is a larger percentage of alternative assets and a higher percentage of equities. With the public markets going up as much as they did in the first quarter, obviously, as a percentage overall, our alternative assets came down a bit, so that brought the EFR pressure down slightly. And then we had quite a few successes as Jenny mentioned in her remarks, in ETFs, Canvas, separately managed accounts. And all these things are lower fee rate businesses. It's less about fee erosion per se. I'd say, it's just more about the business mix. So for the next quarter specifically, we expect EFR to probably be even in the high 37, so let's say, high 37 to 38, but this is because of the success that we didn't anticipate as much success with Putnam because the overall Putnam business is a lower effective fee rate.  They're kind of in the mid-35s. Faster inflows from Great-West Life at the lower end as we communicated, hopefully, clearly enough that those -- the $25 billion of AUM that we expect to come in from Great-West Life, that will ultimately, when we get it all in, that will be in the mid-teens. But the initial amount that we've got are all in the lower fee categories, things like investment-grade credit, for example, for general account. But then on top of that, we expect continued growth in our ETF, Canvas and separately managed accounts, all of which are lower fee rates. Now the reason why we keep the guide for the year in the 38s is because we have a view, again, as Jenny mentioned, of our alternative asset fundraising capabilities and expectations for the next 12 months, let's call it. So on an annual basis, we expect the mix of business around alternative assets, equities, fixed income and then these other areas of growth that I just mentioned, to offset the fee reductions that at times in various quarters could go into the high 37s, but that's just based for that 1 quarter -- on the mix that 1 quarter. But for the year, we expect to remain fairly stable in the 38 area. Operator : Next question will be from Ken Worthington at JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : On the institutional pipeline, when you win an institutional fixed income mandate, are you getting a bunch of cash? Or are you getting a portfolio of securities that you transition and then remanage and do you get a sense of where the assets are coming from? If it's going into fixed income, is it investors going from rates to credit? Are they going from equities to fixed income? Are they going from cash to fixed income? Or are they just switching managers because of performance? So any view on what you've seen in this pipeline that's driving the fixed income success you're having? Adam Spector : You might not like the answer, but the answer is yes. I think we're seeing all of those things, right? So often, people will switch managers because of performance. We see people beginning to extend duration out. Those are usually funded by cash. We should see some of the plus sectors being added to those are funded in a mix of different ways. And then, of course, on the retail side, it's typically a sale of a fund, so you really don't know where that's coming from. In terms of how folks fund things I would say that's a mix. We see 3 different ways. We see it being funded in cash. We see people using a transition manager and then sometimes we'll see folks fund to us with securities and ask us to get to the new point by a certain time. The other interesting thing we see in terms of how accounts are funded is actually outside of fixed income on the Canvas side, where we see significant use cases for Canvas as a tool to aid in the funding of accounts for taxable accounts we're able to do that in a much more tax-efficient way. Kenneth Worthington : Okay. Great. And just on ETFs, how are you thinking about ETFs outside the U.S.? You're having nice success in your franchise within the States. How are you thinking about leveraging the brand? Or are you thinking about leveraging the brand you have and the ETF franchise that you've already built? Adam Spector : Yes. Our ETFs outside of the U.S. have grown in 2 important ways. One, I don't think this was the point of your question, but our single country ETFs, so ETFs that focus on the country, even if they're sold in the U.S. That's been a huge success for us. We were able to price those very competitively. But also in terms of ETFs that we're selling outside of the U.S. regardless of investment mandate, we've seen real growth there in Canada and in EMEA, in particular. Some of that is the single country flow. As Jenny mentioned in his remarks, we've seen some of the more sustainably oriented products go quite well. Green bonds, Paris-aligned, S&P 500 would be 2 that are examples of that. Outside of the U.S., we continue to see a mix of active, passive and smart beta. Passive is still the most significant portion of the market, but active has by far the highest growth rate. And just to put things into context, I believe that if you look at our flow for this quarter, about half of it or so was from outside of the U.S. in terms of our ETF business. So really trying to expand that to the best we can and seeing very good results. Operator : Next question will be from Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Jenny, I was hoping to dig into your comments from the prepared remarks when you talked about being quite busy over the next 12 months with respect to private markets. Could you, I guess, expand on that a little bit? And I'm assuming wealth is going to be part of the answer. So when you think about the opportunity set in the wealth channel and lots of other folks coming in, with offerings already and it seems like that part of the market is getting a little bit busier. What are you guys doing to make sure you don't miss the window and opportunity there? Jennifer Johnson : Yes. So I mean we're in the market with a few different things. And as Adam mentioned, we are getting on calendars. This stuff is laid out, we've probably surprised early on to learn this. I mean sometimes up to 2 years in advance. So the areas that we're talking -- Lexington obviously, has capabilities beyond their traditional Fund 10, where they've got middle market and co-invest offerings. In the case of real estate, Clarion's top 3 biggest funds are all perpetual. So they're always fundraising, although we definitely see kind of muted demand for real estate. They've got terrific performance. They've got terrific performance. And so I think when things shift back, Clarion should do very well there because they have very little exposure to office. In the case of the private credit real estate debt is really interesting, and we're talking to several clients about that. Obviously, CLOs, structured credit, special situations. And then actually, we've been successful. I never know how much I can talk about, but in our -- in Venture, our Franklin Venture Group is in the wealth channel right now raising money and first fund raise there, and it's going very well. So you just had 2 between BSP and Lexington closed their flagship funds. So then you're in -- that they're digesting and investing in those cycles. They're doing more of their niche type strategies, but they're in markets with those. And they'll -- as soon as those are deployed, I think Lexington's probably deployed 60% of their LEX 10, they'll come back into the market for another flagship. But in the meantime, they've got their middle market and co-invest. And I cannot emphasize enough the -- in the wealth channel, it's 50% the right product and 50% where you got the heft on the distribution side. And I think that is often underestimated. Our 350-plus client-facing wholesalers, internal, external specialists included can sell to an adviser's entire book. If you don't have the breadth of capability that we have, that's incredibly expensive because let's say you're just an alternatives manager, you're only selling to 5% to 10% of that adviser's book. And so it gets really expensive to build the breadth of capability that we have. And the years of investment that we've done in the Academy, again, our Academy is global, where we've now been able to bring alternatives by FT, which is a website that has tons of training on how advisers should think about alternatives in their portfolios to supplement just that wholesaler being out there in the field, I think, has been really important. So very much focused on the wealth channel, really excited about it. I think we have a great suite of products to be able to meet the needs in that market and the distribution capability and expertise to be successful there. Alexander Blostein : I got you. Okay. All makes sense. And then clarification for you guys on the pipeline. It sounds like there's a bunch of things in the institutional pipeline, as you discussed earlier. Is it -- could you guys help us just size the fee rate of the institutional pipeline, excluding Great-West as you described it? And then I guess is it fair to assume that the remaining piece of Great-West that's going to come in will be coming in at a much high fee rate? So kind of north of that teen-ish basis points, just given that the back end or what's come through came at a pretty low fee rate? Jennifer Johnson : And the pipeline is -- the fee rate is slightly up from last quarter. But look, any time you want it's institutional, so that's lower fee than your traditional EFRs. And then number two, it's heavily weighted in the fixed income -- well, the new stuff is heavily weighted in fixed income, but probably overall pipeline, I don't know, Adam, a 60-plus percent probably fixed income. So I never know if we give guidance on the actual numbers in the pipeline, but it's -- [indiscernible] Matt, have we given guidance there? Adam Spector : I would say it's consistent with our institutional fee rate. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Okay. Matthew Nicholls : It's in the mid- to high 20s, Alex, and then -- but it can be -- it's gone from anything from the mid- to high 20s to our overall effective fee rate. depending on the quarter and depending on the type of the -- the nature of the pipeline in a particular time. And then the -- to answer your second question, yes, the additional flows we expect to come in will be higher on average on the rest of the Great-West Life flow. And that's expected over the next 12 months. As we've said, we'll, of course, put that detail into our monthly flow. So you can see that, and then we'll provide detail on the effective fee rate when we have these calls and provide updated information. Operator : Next question will be from Bill Katz at TD Cowen. William Katz : Okay. I apologize on London weather. So in terms of if I start with your reported net flows of 6.7 and I back out the 3.1 of dividends reinvested, which the industry doesn't include, I get down about 3.5. If I back out the initial capital from Great-West, that's minus $10 billion. If I then back out the $1.4 billion from the 3 alt managers you highlighted, I get to about $11 billion. And then if I back out the Canvas, ETF and the SMA, I think that gets about minus $18 billion for what I would consider to be a long-holding business. A, is that math correct? And B, if it is, what's the go-to plan here to sort of stabilize that part of the business? Adam Spector : So I'm not Matt Nicholls, I can't do the math that quickly. He probably could. So I couldn't quite follow all of that. But I will tell you that the growth areas where some of the things you wanted to pull out alternatives, ETFs, Canvas. I think we said consistently that those are our growth focuses and that they're growing a little faster than the rest of the business. If you take a look at the more traditional business and you look at our outflow rate our decay rate, it's really been stable to improving. So I think over the last few years, we've been able to do a very good job at protecting ourselves on the downside. And as we said earlier, I think Jenny pointed to a notion that we talk about in terms of core sales, which is our smaller sales, which are up pretty consistently at about 14% on average. So stable outflows, increasing quarter sales we're feeling pretty good about the traditional part of the business. Jennifer Johnson : And I'll just add, look, we've been very open and honest that we've been underrepresented in the retirement channel. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we were ranked 14th on Empower's platform, and it's similar in some of the others. And with this acquisition of Putnam and the relationship and the absorption of their retirement team as well as their target date products, 1/3 of retirement flows go to the qual side investment plans, and they've got phenomenal performance of their target date products as well as stable value, we think we are poised to -- and again, if we just take our market share, it's a massive increase -- the retirement channel is still a very traditional asset-oriented channel, traditional mutual funds, equities and fixed income. And we just think with our distribution capability, not just to benefit from Empower, but taking that to all the different retirement platforms and gain more market share there. Matthew Nicholls : And then the last thing I'd just add, Bill, is that this area you're trying to get to, which we actually have a little bit -- it's not really 18, but we think of it as I think it's more like 10 that we got to. But when you get to those numbers, it's very concentrated in areas where performance is even more important than usual, let's call it. And in those areas, performance has begun to improve, certainly on the equity side, in particular, quite significantly. So we've seen quite a slowdown in those outflows. On the fixed income side in the couple areas, we've had some weaknesses there, as you know, but we've seen some improvement there, too. So it's a fairly concentrated situation you're referring to and one that as performance improves, you see a correlation of slowdown in outflows. Adam Spector : And Bill, I would add that it's sometimes difficult to separate investment product from the vehicle itself. We have a number of businesses where an investment team is positive, but they're positive because their SMA, their usage, their ETFs are all positive, and the mutual fund might be negative. So is that the core business, they're not, right? At the traditional asset class, they're gaining flow, but they're gaining it because of the vehicle choice, not necessarily because the mutual fund is positive. William Katz : That makes some sense. And just a follow-up on all of that, Matt, maybe for yourself, just your base fee rate, it just seems like it's bouncing around a little more than I would envision just given the sheer sizing of the platform today. So can you help me understand if you're going to be sort of in that 37% range plus for the next quarter. And then you sort of bounce back into the fourth? Is that input to a very high level of flow in the alts managers. And if that's the case, is that just vehicles that are just turning on from capital to raise? Or is that from new money coming in the door? And if so, where might that be? Matthew Nicholls : Well, remember, the annual guide I gave included the first quarter or so where we had an elevated EFR for the reason that I explained around the catch-up fees and so on. I think we were pretty close to 40 basis points at one point. We've been trying to be quite clear about that. So when you normalize that out, you get into the 38. And then the only thing that's driving it down periodically from quarter-to-quarter is the areas of growth. And when you add those areas of growth up and you just a second ago, Bill, when you went through your analysis on the traditional side of the business versus other areas of growth. When you start adding up ETFs, Canvas, SMAs and then the flows from Putnam, the overall Putnam -- remembering that it's not just the flows coming from Great-West Life from Putnam, it's the $160 billion, which is 17% higher than when we announced transaction of AUM that's at a multiple basis -- multiple point lower than the EFR of Franklin. So the fact that we've been more successful in that has -- that's what's driven the EFR down a little bit. But what we'd expect is that going into at least fiscal 2025, what we experienced at the beginning of fiscal 2024, depending on what products we have and everything that Jenny just read through or not, there's a possibility that it could step back up again into the higher 38 based on the episodic alternative asset fees. But that's just an exclamation around why it could go up a little bit more and down a little bit more than usual. It's those offsetting factors. It's basically a form of business mix plus the episodic activity out of alternatives. Bill, I'll also answer because I think you had the question on a little bit more of a breakdown of our third quarter. I've already gone into some detail on EFR. In terms of comp and benefits for the third quarter, we expect that to be around $820 million. That assumes performance fees of $40 million. That's lower than the previous quarters, driven by lower performance fees out of our real estate business for the reason that Jenny mentioned, it's important to note that the relative performance of Clarion is very strong, but the absolute valuation of real estate has come down, that's impacted the extent of performance fees. That's why we're guiding that down to $40 million from $50 million. IS&T, we expect it to remain at $150 million, occupancy, $80 million. As you all know, that's going to come down later on in fiscal 2025 based on the double rent going away. But for next quarter, we expect that to remain at $80 million. And then G&A, we expect to be probably around $175 million. It could be as high as $180 million because we're planning on spending more in advertising, but it won't go -- it shouldn't go a bit beyond that. So let's say, $175 million to $180 million in G&A. And I already provided the annual guidance earlier on based on Dan Fannon's question. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO, for final comments. Jennifer Johnson : Great. Well, everybody, thank you for participating in today's call. And once again, we would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication delivering this quarter. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again next quarter, and everybody stay healthy. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Chief Communications Officer and Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. You may begin. Selene Oh : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly results. Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are just described in more detail in Franklin\u2019s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to, Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jennifer M. Johnson: Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton\u2019s results for the third fiscal quarter of 2024. I\u2019m joined by Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. We\u2019ll answer your questions in a few minutes, but first I\u2019d like to review some highlights from the quarter. During our third quarter, investors continued to be faced with a complex investment landscape due to dynamic financial markets amidst macroeconomic, geopolitical and election uncertainty. Starting with public equity markets. The S&P 500 reached an historic milestone earlier this month, closing above 5,500 for the first time and continuing its streak of strong performance in 2024. Likewise, the Nasdaq 100 also hit record levels surpassing the 20,000 mark. However, we\u2019ve seen a pullback in late July as Big Tech earnings have disappointed and value has outperformed growth stocks month to-date. The two big themes of artificial intelligence and inflation drove growth stocks to outperform value stocks in the first half of the calendar year. AI is impacting companies well beyond mega-cap tech companies. Everyday companies and governments are examining how AI will improve or disrupt their respective operations and business models. Inflationary trends continue to moderate, which is supportive of markets. But, because stock market returns have been so highly concentrated, equity allocations are poised to broaden as we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks, which could provide a sustained boost to sectors and regions that have been overlooked. This trend will likely create investment opportunities favoring active managers. Meanwhile, on interest rates, consensus estimates currently expect two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the remainder of the year, which looks broadly appropriate to us. Recent Fed speak signals greater comfort with the latest progress on disinflation and acknowledges some signs of weakening growth momentum. As we get closer to the Fed\u2019s rate cutting cycle, we expect traditional fixed income sectors to regain their place as a primary source for yield as cash begins to look less attractive. While spreads are tight at their current levels, we are not anticipating a sharp deceleration in activity, and our fixed income managers continue to find opportunities at attractive yields. Private markets continue to thrive, and our specialist investment managers are seeing very attractive yields in the private credit space and secondary private equity is seeing near unprecedented levels of pricing power. As investors weigh the impacts of these trends, we\u2019re seeing a pickup in money in motion and investors becoming more active with alternatives, fixed income and select equity sectors as top priorities. We also continue to see the trend of clients wanting to work with fewer managers given the dynamic complex nature of current markets. In addition, we continue to have success engaging more and more in a consultative way with large clients leveraging the full strength of our firm. One of the benefits of partnering with Franklin Templeton is the breadth of capabilities we offer through a single global platform, making us a true partner for clients around the world. We offer access to specialist investment managers across public and private markets and asset classes and continue to broaden our investment capabilities to help clients achieve better outcomes. Now, turning to the highlights from the quarter. Ending AUM was $1.65 trillion flat from the prior quarter and an increase of 15% from the prior year quarter primarily due to the addition of Putnam, as well as positive markets. Average AUM increased by 3% from the prior quarter to $1.63 trillion and increased by 15% from the prior year quarter. In terms of investment performance, our investment teams have remained true to their distinct disciplines and time tested approaches. Investment performance remained consistent across the 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods. This quarter, 53%, 49%, 52% and 70% of our strategy composite AUM outperformed their respective benchmarks on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year basis. Turning to flows. Long-term net outflows were $3.2 billion. Reinvested distributions were $3.6 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the prior quarter, and $3.5 billion in the prior year quarter. $5.9 billion was funded out of the previously announced $25 billion allocation from Great-West Lifeco, bringing the total funded to $20.2 billion. We continue to make progress executing on our long-term plan of diversification across asset classes, investment vehicles and geographies. Client demand led to positive net flows in multi-asset and alternative strategies during the quarter. Multi-asset net inflows were $1.8 billion and driven by positive net flows into Canvas, Franklin Income Fund, Fiduciary Trust International and Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. The investment solutions team takes Franklin Templeton\u2019s best thinking and leverages our firm-wide capabilities across public and private asset classes to help provide solutions tailored to our clients\u2019 needs, investment solutions ended the quarter with AUM of nearly $80 billion across the firm. Alternative net inflows were $1.4 billion driven by growth into private market strategies. Our three largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners and Lexington Partners, generated a combined total of $1.1 billion of net inflows, and Franklin Venture Partners generated net inflows of over $300 million. Benefit Street Partners continued to raise funds in alternative credit. In May, we announced the final close of its BSP Special Situations Fund II with $850 million of total capital commitments exceeding its target. Interest from clients to diversify private debt portfolios beyond direct lending into areas like real estate debt has attracted significant high-quality engagement with investors. Turning to secondary private equity, Lexington Partners announced a dedicated strategy and highly experienced team focused on leading single-asset continuation vehicle transactions in response to increased investor demand. Lexington has invested approximately $6 billion in CV transactions to-date, and the new team will be focused on increasing its participation in CV transactions with a differentiated approach. In secondary private equity, the largest, most established managers continue to see the most interest in flows reflecting a clear bias toward them in the market. Lexington has been a beneficiary of this trend. Clarion Partners has three open-end funds that perpetually fundraise in the U.S. and this year launched a fourth open-end fund in Europe focusing on the logistics sector. Clarion continues to be well-positioned with over half of AUM in the industrial and logistics sectors and less than 8% of AUM in the office sector. With regard to the wealth management channel, we continued to make strides and open new opportunities for investors given our strength in global retail distribution and dedicated specialist sales team with a focus on investor education. This quarter, we announced the expansion of our retail alternatives initiatives with a dedicated team in the EMEA region. Looking ahead, we remain focused on product development, including new products in secondary private equity and real estate private debt. Just as a reminder, at the start of our fiscal year, we anticipated raising $10 billion to $15 billion in fundraising and alternatives. And as of this quarter, we are well on our way to reaching the top-end of that range having raised over $12 billion fiscal year-to-date. It\u2019s worth noting that since being part of Franklin Templeton\u2019s platform, each alternative asset manager has increased AUM and continued to grow and diversify across strategies, product vehicles and client type. Fixed income net outflows were $4.8 billion excluding inflows from Great-West. Inflows improved approximately 5% from the prior quarter. As we\u2019ve said on previous calls, we benefit from our broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies. Despite mixed performance in certain U.S. taxable strategies, we saw client interest reflected in positive net flows into highly customized multi-sector and global sovereign strategies. Additionally, we continue to benefit from vehicle diversification with cross-border funds, ETFs and SMAs and fixed income, all in positive net flows. Notably, we saw increasing interest from clients in multi-sector credit strategies, which capitalize on our team\u2019s ability to offer multiple credit sector exposure in one strategy in a highly dynamic environment. Equity net outflows were $1.6 billion significantly improving from outflows of $5.3 billion in the last quarter, and gross sales improved by 16%. Equity net inflows were driven by large cap value and all cap core strategies and our single country ETFs. Our single country ETF now totaled $10 billion in AUM. With a broad lineup of capabilities, we are able to deliver investment expertise across vehicle types. We saw another strong quarter of positive net flows across our retail SMAs, Canvas and ETF offerings. We are a leading franchise in retail SMAs with $140 billion in assets under management. This quarter, we generated positive net flows of $500 million, the 5th consecutive quarter of net inflows. Through innovative technologies, we are continuing to enable personalized portfolio solutions and improved outcomes for investors. A good example is Canvas, our Custom Indexing solution platform. Canvas generated net inflows of $800 million in the quarter. AUM increased by 13% from the prior quarter to $8.2 billion and continues to have a robust pipeline. Meanwhile, our ETF business continues to see strong growth and generated net inflows of approximately $3.3 billion doubling the prior quarter\u2019s net flows and was the 11th consecutive quarter of positive net flows. Our platform provides solutions for a range of market conditions and investment objectives through active, smart beta and passively managed ETFs. Just five years ago, our ETF AUM was $4 billion. AUM stood at $27 billion at quarter-end across more than a 100 strategies. As a result of our regionally focused sales model, we continue to deepen our presence across the globe. Our non-U.S. business saw its 5th consecutive quarter of positive net flows and finished the quarter with approximately $492 billion in assets under management. Our institutional pipeline of one but unfunded mandates was $17.8 billion not including the remaining allocation from Great-West. We continue to expand our Private Wealth Management business and Fiduciary Trust International AUM has more than doubled in the past five years from $17 billion to $38 billion. Athena Capital and Pennsylvania Trust acquired in 2020 have grown almost 40% since acquisition. One of our priorities is to further accelerate the growth of our Wealth Management business through organic investments and acquisitions. Our commitment to innovation, artificial intelligence, blockchain and machine learning positions us to enhance client outcomes across the rapidly changing technology enabled investment landscape. As various aspects of the asset management industry evolve, we continue to make investments in technology across distribution, investment management and operations. Earlier this quarter, we announced that we are working with Microsoft to build an advanced financial AI platform, which will help embed artificial intelligence into our sales and marketing processes to create more personalized support for clients. We also announced plans to make a strategic minority investment in Envestnet, a significant industry platform. And earlier this week, we announced the selection of a single platform to unify our investment management technologies across public market asset classes. This will support the simplification of our operation and reduce long-term capital expenditures. Formed in 2018, our Franklin Templeton Digital Assets Group has directly witnessed the revolutionary impact of blockchain technology. The digital asset space has experienced significant growth in recent years much like the proliferation of new technologies decades ago. Capitalizing on this trend, we launched our second digital asset backed ETF earlier this week, the Franklin Ethereum ETF, to give our clients additional access to this emerging asset class. Earlier today, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with SBI Holdings, a leading online financial conglomerate in Japan. The proposed joint venture will focus on ETFs and emerging asset classes, including digital assets and cryptocurrencies. The extensive reach of SBI\u2019s brand in Japan aligns well with our commitment to help new generations of investors achieve their financial goals through innovative strategies. Turning briefly to financial results. Adjusted operating income was $424.9 million an increase of 1.3% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 10.9% from the prior year quarter. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in the business to support our strategic priorities in Asset Management and Wealth Management. Finally, in June, Investment News recognized Franklin Templeton as Asset Manager of the Year. This is a true testament to all of our employees around the world and their commitment to being the ideal partner in helping both individuals and institutions achieve their key financial goals and objectives. I would like to thank our employees for always putting clients first. Now, let\u2019s open it up to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And, your first question will be from Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping we could start with the Aladdin announcement. I know it\u2019s been sort of speculated for the last couple of quarters, so nice to get it out there. But, can you talk about the operational benefits and both expense, benefits and operating margins ultimately, that you expect the platform to deliver. How long it\u2019s going to take to get fully implemented, etcetera? And as part of that, maybe Matt, you can just hit on the expense items for the rest of the year as well? Thanks. Matthew Nicholls : Yes. Thank you, Alex. Good morning. So, a couple of background points first, why have you done this, what we expect to get out of it. And then, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the implementation costs and timeline and so on as you\u2019ve asked. So first of all, why we\u2019ve done this? We\u2019ve done this because it unifies our investment management technology across all of our public market businesses which as you know extensive amount of specialist investment managers. This importantly was a decision that was made collectively across all of our specialist investment managers and has taken us no less than 18-months to two-years to make this decision. In terms of the benefits, it brings several things including most of what you\u2019d expect candidly, but most importantly in the form of one platform versus multiple vendors. I\u2019ll just go through a few of the benefits. One, portfolio construction and risk management tools, a single investment book of record, integrated order management systems and connectivity, importantly consistent reporting across the firm and this is good for both clients and for internal reporting purposes. And, it assists in developing cross team, cross specialist investment manager, multi-asset solutions. And, also as you know we\u2019ve been active strategically in the business adding companies over time and with a single platform like this it\u2019s easier to add new business. It\u2019s easier because it\u2019s faster and lower cost to integrate. Thirdly, in terms of implementation costs, so implementation costs are expected to be approximately $100 million over the next three to five years. The peak of these costs will be fiscal \u201826 and \u201827 where we expect about 60% of these expenses to be assumed. Importantly though, we expect to absorb between 50% and 100% of the implementation costs, meaning on a quarterly basis over the next several years, we expect this to be close to neutral from an operating income perspective. At or around fiscal 2028, we expect to begin to realize savings of about $15 million per annum. And then in 2029, we expect that to raise to $25 million at least. Next quarter, we will add approximately $3 million of additional cost to IST associated with the start of this implementation. But again, we\u2019ve got several things going on that should mean that we can absorb that based on other expense initiatives we have in the firm. So as mentioned, given other initiatives the impact per quarter should be quite modest if any. But, if anything is important to call out, we will obviously do that per quarter, Alex, and we\u2019re most likely going to be able to do that in advance in our quarterly guidance. But as I said, the most important message here is even though this is an expensive implementation exercise, we\u2019re going to absorb most of those expenses due to the other efforts that we have going on across the company. In terms of the guide for the next quarter, we expect our effective fee rate to remain stable at 37.5 basis points. We expect comp and benefits to be $825 million very stable from where we were this quarter. This assumes $50 million of performance fees. We expect IS&T to be between $150 million and $155 million. This includes the $3 million that I mentioned earlier with respect to the beginning of our implementation around the investment management platform. Occupancy, we expect to be in the high-70s around $77 million, $78 million and G&A we expect to be between $175 million and $180 million. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you for all of that comprehensive as always. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Next question will be from Brennan Hawken at UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple questions on Lexington. So, curious on an update about how much of Lexington 10 has been deployed. And then, when we think about the threshold for deployment where Lexington would start to look to kick-off fundraising for the next flagship, where does that typically happen? Jennifer M. Johnson: Hey, Brandon. So, first of all, Lexington\u2019s fundraising focuses this year, just to cover a little bit of that, has been middle market and co-investment, and that\u2019s gone well. Meanwhile, they\u2019ve been obviously deploying Fund 10. And, basically, the message is that they have been deploying it faster and at higher discounts than historical. So, it\u2019s looking very good. We don\u2019t have a specific date, but it is quite possible that they will enter the market sooner than they anticipated just because of the ability to deploy the capital faster. And, I think we all see it, right, the liquidity that\u2019s needed in the space. They also interestingly, we mentioned it in the opening remarks about their continuation vehicle. So, they have about $6 billion that they\u2019ve done where these GPs have a particular holding that they want to retain, but some of the LPs want liquidity, so they spit it out into a new vehicle. Lexington hired a market leader in that. They actually think that there\u2019s opportunity to even create a fund in that instead of having it be part of, their traditional funds. So, I think that\u2019s going to be another opportunity for Lexington. Matthew Nicholls : And Jenny, the only piece I would add to that is that, while Lexington historically has been focused on the institutional market, there are significant efforts underway, to ensure that they can better tap the Wealth Management channel by offering perpetual vehicles in Wealth Management in both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re very actively engaged in developing. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that. And just, Jenny, the discounts that you referred to, we had heard that those discounts have actually begun to narrow. Are they still seeing those wide discounts in the marketplace? Or they -- Jennifer M. Johnson: They are definitely starting to narrow, but they are still seeing, robust discounts versus historical discounts. They\u2019re still better than historical discounts. Brennan Hawken : Yes. So, still at attractive levels, I guess, even though they\u2019ve narrowed? Jennifer M. Johnson: Yes. Brennan Hawken : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Craig Siegenthaler at The Bank of America. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, my question is on the $25 billion AUM allocation from Great-West. So, you\u2019re about $5 billion away, after this is reached probably in a few months. Can you talk about the incremental upside to this relationship over time beyond the \u201825? Jennifer M. Johnson: Adam, do you want to take that? Adam B. Spector: Yes, sure. So, with any client, I think you see a relationship grows over time. So, the first $25 billion was really something that was more contractually oriented throughout that process. We have been able to meet many Great-West Lifeco executives, as well as, the related power companies. We are in the midst of product development with them. So, the initial allocation has really been based on the types of products that insurance companies generally are interested in. And, I think if you look at most insurance companies, you\u2019ll see significant allocations to some core fixed income as well as a tail that goes to alternatives. That has been the allocation we\u2019ve received so far. But, what we\u2019ve been able to do since acquisition is to work with Great-West, Great-West Lifeco as well as other power companies to develop newer products both for the retirement platform as well as doing things, on a JV venture on the insurance side. So, we are, not at a point yet where we can pinpoint what those will be, but there is significant product development going on, with Great-West, and we think that we will continue to see, the allocations broaden out from the core fixed income that has been the basis of things so far. Matthew Nicholls : The only thing I\u2019d add to that, Adam and Craig is just for context, obviously we\u2019re delighted with the $25 billion arrangement and the $20 billion we\u2019ve got in so far. But, relative to other clients and investment management firms that the Power Group of Companies does business with, it\u2019s still fairly modest candidly. So, we have a way to go with that relationship and we think of this as a multi-year exercise of building the relationship further versus just something has happened as far as a consequence of a transaction. But, I think it\u2019s important to note and obviously we expect this, I mean, the Power Group of Companies have very significant relationships with other investment. That\u2019s going to continue or we\u2019re doing is pitching for our fair share of it. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Matthew. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Dan Fannon at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Matthew, I was hoping you could clarify or expand upon, what you guys are doing to offset the implementation costs, with the new tech projects. So curious, what those initiatives are, if you could be more specific. And, is there some phase in of that, or are those ongoing now so we shouldn\u2019t think about any kind of catch up period between the or mistiming of some of the implementation costs versus the ongoing savings? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. No, I don\u2019t think there should be any mistiming\u2019s, but as I said Dan, these things are quite complex. We\u2019re not underestimating at all the implementation complexity of a project like this with Aladdin. I should say though that we\u2019ve done this is an understatement to say we\u2019ve done extensive planning around this both planning with our partners that\u2019s both over at Aladdin and Deloitte, the consultant that we\u2019ve hired to work with us on implementation. We\u2019ve done extensive due diligence, we\u2019ve built in contingencies and we have very significant resources, at both Aladdin and Deloitte and of course our own team. But, I don\u2019t so I think we\u2019ve done a ton of work to sort of determine, how the implementation expenditures will work. We\u2019ve been extremely focused on this. If there is anything to call out, as I said, I will do that. But we and again, don\u2019t want to jinx ourselves, but we don\u2019t expect that to happen. In terms of how we\u2019re able to absorb it. One of the tangential benefits I\u2019ve referenced in previous calls of acquiring being so acquisitive over the last five years, notwithstanding all the additional work and complexity around acquisitions, it does lead to future opportunities to integrate and to be more effective and efficient across the different platforms and providers we have. A large portion of the savings is going from multiple providers down to one. Of course, we\u2019re going to have other relationships still on the technology side that complement our relationship with Aladdin. But, we\u2019ll have less than that. We also have a much larger scaled relationships. So of course, the pricing benefits that we have are very meaningful in that regard. The amount of resources we have externally from the Aladdin platform and our partners there and Deloitte are more than we could afford ourselves and frankly absorb some of the costs that otherwise we would have, if we were modernizing our own platform, for example. So, it\u2019s all of those things sort of combined. We have multiple middle offices. We have multiple systems. They\u2019re quite complex technologies all good and it works fine just to be clear. But, this is coming boiling down into one platform this way less vendors, more efficiency across our whole firm, which is needed anyway in terms of where the industry is heading is how we\u2019re able to afford to do this in the effective way as I described. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Matthew Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Next question will be from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Just wanted to circle back to the JV that you announced this morning in Japan with SBI. I was just hoping maybe you can remind us of your footprint in Japan today. Certainly, a lot of changes in that market. Just curious how you\u2019re seeing that opportunity set evolving. Where do you see some of the biggest opportunities there in Japan? And how does this, JV help in terms of tapping into the opportunity set in that market? And, maybe you could touch upon what the economics will be and then how you sort of envision this JV working over-time and what success might look like? Jennifer M. Johnson: Yes. So, I mean, we\u2019ve been in Japan for a long time. Fortunately, Putnam actually has great relationships in Japan. And as a matter of fact, this quarter, I think we had $3.2 billion in net inflows in Japan. Big part of that was institutional business and with Putnam. Japan on the retail side has been a little bit more difficult and it is a market that is beginning to launch ETFs and starting to talk about digital assets. And, honestly the foreign investment shop, it can be difficult to penetrate that. So here with SBI, they have a tremendous reach. I mean, they\u2019re probably the largest digital financial conglomerate. And so it\u2019s I think it\u2019s a 51% owned SBI, 49% Franklin Templeton. And, we\u2019ll be launching joint ETFs. And, as the digital market opens up, we\u2019ll be able to launch products there in the crypto space as well. Matthew Nicholls : And, our footprint now in Japan really is not that different than anywhere else in the marketplace. It\u2019s nice to be able to have a significant local base there. Because of that, we have a strong institutional business. We\u2019ve seen the results of that inflows this quarter. We\u2019ve been able to really accelerate some of the great performance that Putnam has and won some assets there. In the retail space, we have a relationship with a number of different distributors. We also have a very strong insurance business in Japan. The only other thing I would note about SBI is that Japan is not a market that is, always recognized for its innovation, and SBI is an exception to that. It\u2019s one of the first significant firms to really be breaking through on the digital side in terms of client engagement. And, we think partnering with them will allow us to be one of the first asset managers to have more of that direct consumer digital engagement model in Japan. And, the asset base in Japan now is close to $50 billion for us. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. If you just circle back on the ETF strategy, basically $27 billion like you said. But given the very wide range of products you have and strategies you have across the entire complex, what\u2019s the desire to more substantially expand that ETF franchise? Is there an ability to clone more active product or is it more of a two-pronged strategy of doing that and rolling out more passive product? And then if you could just talk about connecting that with the or how easy it is to do that with the new Aladdin platform realizing it\u2019ll take some time, of course. Jennifer M. Johnson: So, from an ETF standpoint, I mean, actually our largest category of ETFs over 40% is active. And then the next category is passive and then smart beta and then digital. So, our focus on ETFs is as a firm, we view ourselves as vehicle agnostic. So, whatever the market is interested in having us deliver our capabilities, we\u2019ll deliver it in whatever vehicle they\u2019d like. And there is a strong demand of advisors, particularly in the U.S. who are interested in ETFs. I think is driven a lot by the shift to fee based and so it\u2019s been important for us to be able to launch products. I think we have over 100 ETFs today and to be able to launch products that are appropriate. There is there has been some feedback about a concern of launching close between a traditional mutual fund and an ETF, because it can bring suitability issues to the distribution platforms. And so, we like to either look at existing, say, mutual funds and potentially convert them if an ETF is a better way to deliver it or launch some sort of ETF that is a slightly different approach. Now interestingly, we\u2019re getting a lot of demand from Latin America pensions that are interested in our single country ETFs, which are, I believe, the lowest price in the market. And so we\u2019ve been getting good strong flows there. We\u2019re getting flows from Europe as well as Japan. And so it\u2019s really global. Our view is in a lot of these markets ETFs are becoming the vehicle of choice. And so we need to be able to support that. I don\u2019t know if Adam, do you want to add anything to that? Adam B. Spector: Yeah. I\u2019d add a few things, Jenny. The flow there has been quite strong for us at 3.3 in net flow, this quarter and that\u2019s 7 quarters in a row where we\u2019ve had about a $1 billion or more, in flow. As Jenny said, that flow is coming from a geographically diverse base where we saw about $900 million coming in from EMEA, and about $0.5 billion coming in from the Americas region. I\u2019d also just follow-up with Jenny\u2019s point on being agnostic in terms of vehicles. Our most significant and longest tenured mutual fund, US mutual fund is the income fund. But if we look at the income fund for this quarter just as an example, we saw very slight outflows in the mutual fund, but positive flows in the related SMA, positive flows in the cross border fund, positive flows in the ETF. So, by offering four different vehicle types there, the category for the income strategies in general was net flow positive. And as investor demand becomes more global and shifts away from mutual funds, having multiple vehicles allows us to capture that flow. Jennifer M. Johnson: And actually I\u2019m just going to say one thing on that. It\u2019s often viewed that ETFs are potentially lower margin and I think that comes out of the history of it being sort of early on passive. Honestly it depends on kind of the strategy in the case of the income fund where we\u2019re having so much success in those other vehicles, the pricing is actually very much in line with what the mutual fund is. And arguably over time, the cost to us will be less with the ETF and the SMA, because you don\u2019t have the transfer agency and the fund administration costs in the same way that you do with the mutual fund. That actually was one of the drivers in our decisions to outsource those things because it allows us as the business shifts to have greater flexibility in the expense supporting the business. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. Thank you for all that detail. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Ken Worthington at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about possible extension of duration by investors at the FedEx later this year, which of your fixed income products do you think are best positioned to benefit with better sales? And then along the same line, some of the big flagship Western funds are still struggling with performance and outflows picked up this quarter, both gross and net. What are the issues sort of weighing on those funds? Jennifer M. Johnson: So, first of all, as if rates go down, I think we probably are guessing two cuts this year. Obviously, cash becomes less interesting as your fixed income allocation and you\u2019re going to probably see people move more into other fixed income. We\u2019ve had two out of our three SIMs in positive net flows in fixed income. As a matter of fact, Franklin\u2019s performance is excellent with 71% of AUM outperforming peers in the one, three, and five year. Brandywine has 92% of their AUM outperforming peers in the five year category. And five out of our top 10 gross selling strategies are in fixed income and that actually includes some of Western strategies. We have positive flows in a lot of different vehicles. So, our cross border with our euro short duration is in positive flows. Our ETFs and fixed income are positive flows. Our retail SMAs are in positive flows, and we have positive flows in our closed end funds. Interest and actually the largest portion of our institutional pipeline is fixed income. And again, that does not include Great-West Life. Interestingly, if you think about passive and how it potentially impacts fixed income, it\u2019s been the areas that passive has actually cannibalized to some extent has really been in that core and core plus space. And so in multi sector, the highly customized munis, Adam help me out on the other strategies. And you\u2019re not seeing that kind of cannibalization from the passive. And then Western as we\u2019ve talked about their positioning has been longer duration. So as rates come down that actually is potentially a benefit as far as the positioning and, we\u2019ve seen it in their kind of one month performance has improved a lot. Adam B. Spector: Yeah. I would add a few things. We didn\u2019t really talk about the muni franchise in that, Jenny. The muni performance is really strong. We have about 90% of assets, outperforming on the one year period and about 75% outperforming on the three and five. We think we\u2019ll see significant growth in munis, and the fact that we had a strong SMA franchise there as well as mutual funds, it\u2019s really helping us. In terms of, the shift in rates with, a steeper yield curve, we think we will see money coming out of cash into longer term fixed income, which should benefit us. The other thing we\u2019ve seen is that in a market, with fairly tight credit spreads, we see allocations going more and more to managers who have the ability, to be multi sector or multi credit exposures and, to have the ability to allocate across those different sleeves, and that bodes well for us as well as we are very strong in those areas. The final thing I would note, is that our insurance capabilities are highly specialized, and we\u2019ve seen real growth in fixed income coming from insurance specific mandates where the regulatory, reporting compliance aspects of managing those accounts is as or more important than the alpha generation. Jennifer M. Johnson: And I just to add, one thing on the on cash management because a lot of people look at all the dollars in money market funds and think that that\u2019s going to move out. But our money market funds, Westerns tend to have sovereign wealth and corporate treasurers who aren\u2019t allocating as a temporary in between. As a matter of fact, Western had $2 billion in net flows, which really came from a product that was very competitively priced and attracted money from corporate treasurers. And then actually Franklin\u2019s product, which is a Luxembourg product, had $800 million in flows. I think that was the fastest growing money market fund from some list that I saw, which was really offshore clients who wanted to take advantage of the yields in the U.S. And I think that product now it\u2019s Luxembourg U.S. dollar short term money market fund, and it\u2019s now $1.1 billion in AUM. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Bill Katz at TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, there\u2019s a lot of ins and outs, to the franchise right now. And just maybe stepping back for a moment, I guess, where I\u2019m struggling a little bit on the storyline is how do you drive both top line and bottom-line growth here? Because when I adjust for where your flows are coming in versus where they\u2019re going out, it would seem to me that the fee rate may go lower. I\u2019m so curious your thoughts on that. And then given now any incremental savings that you think you can do will sort of supplement the growth for the Aladdin platform. It would seem like you\u2019re more of a top line story than a top line plus expense leverage, but then I worry the fee rate might go lower because of the mix. So, how do we think about how do you get revenue growth from here and then how you turn that into operating leverage? Thank you. Jennifer M. Johnson: So, let\u2019s start and then, Matt, have you kind of jump on to some of the EFR and some of the other things. Look, I think that one of the things that the pivot into adding alternatives obviously, one of the benefits of that is that it\u2019s just a fee even excluding performance fee as it\u2019s based on investment management fee. And this year, we guided to $10 billion to $15 billion. We\u2019re going to end out up close to $15 billion and yet the AUM is pretty flat and that\u2019s really because of inflows plus market is sort of offset by some outflows and really realizations in distributions. But it was a year where we weren\u2019t in the market with a flagship secondary PE fund from Lexington and frankly, real estate\u2019s been really soft. So while, Clari Partners has three of their largest funds that are open ended and there\u2019s perpetual fundraising. There just hasn\u2019t been huge allocations to real estate. So, we hit a couple of those because I do think there\u2019s opportunity for that pipeline to expand. Let me start with real estate. I think there\u2019s a feeling that this market has really bottomed. And that\u2019s driven by two things. One is more clarity on where rates are as well as probably more realistic marks that the bid and ask spreads are coming closer. And in talking to folks at Clarion, think about it. Office it used to be 35% of the index. It\u2019s now down to 17%. So finally, maybe there\u2019s more to go on office as far as dropping in the marks and Clarion only as 8% allocated to office. But you\u2019ve had a huge adjustment in pricing. As a matter of fact, Clarion is seeing RFP volumes go up a little bit. You\u2019re starting to see recessions and redemption queues. And more importantly, some of the properties that they sold in like logistics have sold for above the appraised value and, and some of the multifamily above where the marks were. So, that\u2019s kind of a sign that the real estate market\u2019s getting healthy again. And I think the feeling is by the end of \u201824, we\u2019re going to start to see managers allocating back to real estate. I already mentioned about Lexington where, they\u2019ve been deploying Fund 10 faster, and so hopefully we\u2019ll be in the market sooner for their next fund. And again, this is just a supply and demand issue, which is so much has been deployed in the alternative space and there\u2019s a need for liquidity for a variety of reasons. And we do see M&A starting to pick up, but their needs for that liquidity and there\u2019s only a handful of large secondary managers that can buy big LP positions when needed. And so that\u2019s been where we\u2019ve been able to have true pricing power in the secondaries. And then, I mentioned on BSP, we think this real estate debt there\u2019s some parts of private credit that have been pretty tight, but real estate debt, because of the retrenchment of regional banks, has made this just fertile ground for real opportunity, both from institutional clients interested in and really great conversations we\u2019re having with distributors who are interested in the wealth channel and offering products there. So, we think that we\u2019ve been -- if you just look at this year for alternatives, you\u2019re kind of at a baseline. And I think there\u2019s a lot more opportunity with some of this gets healthy. And that right there carries some of the fees up. I did mention the reduction in our fees, a lot of the EFR was an adjustment because we added Putnam. And so it\u2019s not just if the asset mix in fixed income takes a much bigger percentage than equity, of course, you\u2019re going to have it, but you\u2019re not seeing the degradation because of vehicles as much as I think people are thinking that\u2019s happening. We\u2019re not seeing that at the same level. And then Matt, you want to cover anything? Matthew Nicholls : Yes. I mean, I think Jenny you covered most of it. I mean, there\u2019s differences from last quarter, Bill, on the EFR, for example, the business mix is probably a little bit under 0.1 basis point, Putnam was 0.9. Now a lot of that has to do with the calculation at the EFR itself. But we thought the 0.9 would be a little bit less than that, hence the slight difference from the guide that I gave. The reason why it ended up being as much as 0.9 is because frankly, Putnam is growing faster than we anticipated, is growing faster now, projections every month it\u2019s growing faster than we thought. For perspective, Putnam\u2019s AUM is 23% higher than when we announced transaction or 13% higher than when we closed the transaction. And they\u2019ve been in positive flows every month since both quarters since. So, what that\u2019s meant is because they\u2019re at a lower effective fee rate, the averaging and the calculation, everything, it means that the EFR has come down a bit. If you take that into account and then you take into account previous quarters where we\u2019ve had episodic boosts to EFR such as Lexington\u2019s catch up fees. Our EFR has actually been fairly stable. I mean, it has come down a little bit, but it\u2019s normally by 0.1 here and there. And that as Jenny mentioned is largely due to a little bit of the mix and frankly the growth in ETF, Canvas, SMA solutions. And we expect that group of things to be growing. It\u2019s very hard to have all of the things flowing that we\u2019ve invested in one quarter. One day we will actually get alternatives, ETFs, Canvas, SMA and solutions all coming together at once where we get the fundraising in ops lined up with all those other more organic and more on-going growth areas of those vehicles. When we do that, we\u2019ve got a good shot at it offsetting the areas of shrinkage that you referenced. I\u2019ll also point out that if you take out some of the larger sort of tax or fixed income areas that you\u2019ve pointed to and others have pointed to, we\u2019d be in positive flows in the business right now. So anyway, just to give you a little bit more information on AFR. Adam B. Spector: And Bill, the final thing I would add is Jenny talked a lot about alternatives. Alternatives and wealth management is something obviously we\u2019re focusing on that I think is very positive from an EFR perspective. And the final thing I would note is that our core sales that and we think about that as sales that are less than $100 million are up at about 14%. That tends to often be higher fee business, and we see very significant continued growth in core sales. Bill Katz : Thank you for the very comprehensive answer. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Patrick Davitt at Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I have a follow-up on your answer on the Aladdin expense absorption. A lot of what you described sounds like it would have to come through after implementation. So just to clarify, you\u2019re expecting that absorption to be in lock step with the implementation expense. And if so, how do you turn off all of those extra vendor costs if Aladdin isn\u2019t live yet to fill in that capability? Thank you. Adam B. Spector: It\u2019s inclusive of that. So, there will be periods of time where we\u2019re paying for both Aladdin and we\u2019re paying for other vendors. But the quarterly kind of view or vision that I provided to you includes that assumption. So, we still think that there would be very modest adjustments to or impact to operating income per quarter based on our plan over the next five years. Remember, of course, that portion of the $100 million is capitalized. So that gets spread out over more years, probably something like 50% of it gets capitalized over more years than three to five. Jennifer M. Johnson: And I could add that we\u2019re not on a uniform technology platform. So, as you migrate certain SIMs over, you retire their systems. And so it is a little bit lockstep as you go along. Adam B. Spector: Yes. And we have and the other thing is that we the time that we\u2019re implementing Aladdin, we are also implementing other important opportunities across the company that again offset as I mentioned earlier, offset those the sort of the double pay you have to pay across different vendors. And that\u2019s why when you get to the outer years like \u201828, \u201829 and so on, when that gets eliminated, you\u2019re starting talking about $25 million plus of savings. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Adam B. Spector: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin\u2019s President and CEO, for final comments. Jennifer M. Johnson: Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call. And once again, we\u2019d like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. Take care, everybody. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for today. You may now disconnect.",

As I've traveled the world meeting with clients and investors, I've seen firsthand that they recognize and appreciate the many steps we have taken to further diversify our business and position Franklin Templeton to succeed over the long-term. Our clients view us as a trusted partner with the ability to fulfill their comprehensive investment needs across public and private markets in investment vehicles of their choice. They appreciate our ability to customize their capabilities and meet their needs through innovative delivery and solutions. Franklin Templeton leverages the talent of our multiple specialist investment managers to deliver expertise to our clients across a wide range of investment styles and asset classes. Our investment teams benefit from Franklin Templeton's deep resources and scale with centralized investments in distribution, marketing, data, and innovative technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, our model benefits our corporate shareholders with no single specialist investment manager at our firm contributing more than 10% of adjusted operating revenue. And most of our specialist investment managers are diversified within themselves as well. Most recently, we have been investing in AI, blockchain and other important areas relevant to the future of the industry that will benefit our teams and clients. Now, turning to the investor presentation. Beginning on slide 7 and 8, it's notable how much Franklin Templeton has evolved its business over the past five the past five years and where we are focused going forward. Over years, we have increased and accelerated the diversification of our AUM via organic growth and targeted acquisitions into higher growth areas of client demand. Since the beginning of 2019, we have completed significant acquisitions in areas of growth and to position the firm offer more choice to more clients in more places. And those acquired specialist investment managers now represent 64% of AUM, and 55% of adjusted operating revenue. In that period, our institutional AUM increased from 25% to 45% and we are now well balanced between institutional and wealth management. We have made great strides across a number of key focus areas for the company. Turning to slide 9 and starting with investment management. We have now a full spectrum of investment capabilities to help clients meet their varied financial goals. This year, the acquisition of Putnam Investments added strong capabilities such as target date and stable value, which are important in the retirement and insurance channels. And we demonstrated the power of Franklin Templeton's distribution, which led to $11 billion in net flows into Putnam products. This is an example of combining outperforming investment performance with powerful distribution resources. Our focus is on continuing to improve investment performance as well as optimizing the range of our investment product offerings. We are also in the position to leverage breadth of our investment capabilities across both public and private markets. And we see opportunity as these markets begin to converge. For example, Franklin has been putting late-stage venture into mutual funds for over a decade, and Franklin's global allocation fund includes private credit strategies. As a leading manager of alternative assets with approximately $250 billion in AUM, we offer key capabilities including alternative credit, secondary private equity, real estate, hedge funds and venture. Since fiscal year 2019, alternative asset AUM has increased by over five times, through three sizable acquisitions and organic growth. I'm proud to note that, since becoming part of Franklin Templeton, each alternative specialist investment manager has expanded and diversified across strategies, vehicles and clients. Specifically, on the role of alternatives in wealth management, the wealth management channel has approximately only 5% of AUM allocated towards alternatives. But depending on the clients' liquidity needs, it can be much higher. Institutions, for example, have been allocating up to 40% for years. Our global distribution footprint, investor education platform and dedicated alternative specialist team combined with our breadth of investment capabilities make us a relevant force in the wealth management channel. This year, we're pleased that we established the alternatives by Franklin Templeton brand in the wealth management channel in the US and look to broaden it in EMEA and Asia. Over the next five years, our goal is to fundraise at least $100 billion across private markets and look to add additional capabilities, for instance, in infrastructure as well as to globalize certain strategies. Next, turning to distribution. We are one of the most comprehensive global asset managers with clients in over 150 countries. Offering clients a diverse range of investment vehicles is not just beneficial but essential in today's marketplace. Over the last five years, we have seen meaningful growth in retail SMAs and both ETFs and custom indexing AUM has grown by over 3x. In particular, this fiscal year, growth accelerated in retail SMAs, ETFs and Canvas AUM, each reaching record highs. Our ETF business grew by 89% in the year with positive net flows for the 12th consecutive quarter with net flows at or exceeding $1 billion for eight consecutive quarters. And in fact, in the last two quarters, that number has been over $3 billion each. Total assets stand at $31 billion across active and index strategies from just 0 a few years ago. Canvas AUM increased by 94% from the prior year to $10 billion and has generated positive net inflows in every quarter since its acquisition in 2021. We increased the number of partner firms by almost 70% from one year ago. Over the next five years, we are looking to scale ETF AUM by 3x and Canvas assets by 5x. Today, we are a leading provider of retail SMAs with $145 billion in assets, an increase of 29% from the prior year. Going forward, we are focused on expanding our product offerings. For example, we launched a retail SMA variant of our flagship Franklin Income Fund and launched tax-managed option strategies utilizing Canvas. Investment Solutions AUM almost doubled in size to $89 billion from the prior year with the additions of K2 and Putnam's target date funds and through organic growth. Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions will remain a critical component of our growth strategy by leveraging our capabilities across public and private asset classes to deliver customized solutions to meet our clients' demands. Over the next five years, we aim to more than double our solutions platform. Additionally, our breadth and depth of investment capabilities, engagement, capital resources and value-added services positions us well as a valuable partner. This year, we've been delighted to establish new multibillion-dollar relationships with clients in each of our regions and strategic partnerships will remain an important aspect of growth in the future. Turning to Slide 10. Two other important growth areas are Private Wealth Management and Digital and technology. In the Private Wealth Management segment, Fiduciary Trust International has a clear opportunity due to the unprecedented intergenerational transfer of wealth. This will be the largest wealth transfer in history with $84 trillion set the path from older generations to their heirs through 2045. $53 trillion will transfer from households in the Baby Boomer generation. Fiduciary is a fully integrated wealth platform with investment advisory, trust and estate planning, tax planning and custody services. It has impressive client retention rate of approximately 98%. Since 2019, Fiduciary doubled its AUM, reaching an all-time high of $39 billion and had positive net flows annually for the past three years. Going forward, we look to double the size of this business through organic investments and targeted acquisitions. This represents both a standalone opportunity by owning a wealth manager and also a broader distribution opportunity. Investing in innovation and cutting-edge technologies continues to be a strategic importance for the firm. We have made important investments in value-added services, including technology and digital wealth in order to be on the forefront of innovation in areas increasingly important to our clients and operations. In addition, as early adopters of Artificial Intelligence, Franklin Templeton is working to responsibly employ AI to boost productivity, deliver greater value to clients and make our investment processes and operations more efficient. A great example is our partnership with Microsoft that was announced last quarter. We are working collaboratively to build an advanced financial AI platform that will help embed Artificial Intelligence into our sales and marketing processes, creating more personalized support for our clients. In the digital asset space, we continue to look for new ways to leverage blockchain technology. For example, we launched the first US-registered fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership in 2021. And this year, we launched Franklin Bitcoin ETF and Franklin Ethereum ETF, making it easier for clients to access investment opportunities with our digital asset solutions. Looking forward, there are many more exciting advancements that are underway in this space. Matt will cover capital management, operational integration and expense management shortly. Turning to the market performance during our fiscal year. Global equities rose by more than 30% while global bonds increased by nearly 12%. Throughout much of the year, large caps outperformed small caps, driven by top technology and communication services firm with growth stocks exceeding value stocks. Investor enthusiasm around Artificial Intelligence was the major theme over the past 12 months. Moderating inflation and declining bond yields helped the Magnificent Seven stocks advance 53%, while the broader technology sector notched a 52% gain. In our fourth quarter, there was also a corresponding shift in equity market leadership beyond the Magnificent Seven. In fact, only two of the seven stocks in this group have meaningfully outperformed the S&P year-to-date through October. Broader market participation is encouraging for active managers. Eight of the 11 sectors outpaced the broader S&P 500 during the quarter, with just two sectors, technology and communication services, have outperformed over the prior nine months. Both previous winners were levered in the most recent quarter. Investors' focus has shifted from inflation to concerns about the durability of the global economic expansion and by extension, the outlook for corporate profits. And while the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in mid-September make a soft landing in 2025 more likely, the market's push for deeper monetary easing may elevate volatility in the coming quarters. The market expects the Fed to cut rates again this week, and this seems like a reasonable assumption. Recent Fed speak signals greater comfort with the latest progress on disinflation. There is, however, uncertainty on the outlook for labor market as it is difficult to disentangle the temporary impact of strike actions and hurricanes from the most recent week jobs data. As the Fed's rate cutting cycle proceeds, we expect traditional fixed income sectors to take their place as a primary source for yield as cash begins to look less attractive. While spreads are tight at their current levels, we are not anticipating a sharp deceleration in activity. And our fixed income managers continue to find opportunities at attractive yields. Meanwhile, in private markets, our specialist investment managers continue to see strong investment opportunities in alternative credit, secondary private equity and select real estate segments. And demand for differentiated expertise is at a premium as these markets continue to gain interest. For example, we're excited by opportunities in alternative credit, particularly in real estate debt, where BSP manages $8 billion. And given the need for liquidity in private equity, we see strong interest in secondary private equity Lexington. Turning now to fiscal 2024 results in terms of investment performance. Mutual fund investment performance improved in the one, three and 10-year periods from the prior year. Composite investment performance improved in the five and 10-year and stayed essentially flat in the three-year period from the prior year. On close, long-term net outflows were $32.6 billion for the fiscal year, and reinvestment distributions were $20.7 billion. Excluding Western Asset Management, long-term net inflows were $16 billion, compared to net outflows of $5.2 billion in the prior year. We saw a 25% increase in long-term inflows from the prior year to $319 billion. We're pleased to see that gross sales have improved across all asset classes in public markets, as well as across every region in both the retail and institutional distribution channels. From a regional perspective, our international business continues to grow. And we have seen continued momentum with positive long-term net flows for the year and AUM surpassing $500 billion. Gross sales in the US increased by 31%, EMEA by 23%, APAC by 19% and the Americas by 24%. And from a client type perspective, retail sales improved 27%, and institutional sales increased by 21%. From an asset class perspective, turning to alternatives on slide 12, in fiscal year 2024, private markets fund raised $14.8 billion, in line with our targets. Lexington closed its flagship fund with $22.7 billion in total capital commitments raised primarily in 2022 and 2023, ranking among the largest funds raised to date in global secondary private equity market and with approximately 20% raised in the wealth channel. Benefit Street Partners closed its flagship private credit fund and its special situations with $4.7 billion and $850 million in total capital commitments raised, respectively, with each fund exceeding targets. Clarion Partners AUM remained stable despite weakness in the real estate sector in the year. We believe that there is increasing sentiment that worst is behind us. For example, the ODCE benchmark turned positive. And there is the beginning of a pickup in transaction volume, strengthening confidence for potential for transactions in fiscal year 2025. Going forward, we are well positioned in the sector with minimal office exposure of 7% and well-performing products in strong sectors such as industrial, multifamily and life science. In addition, we're excited about new areas of growth that include European logistics fund and investing in new alternative strategies in the US, including self-storage, student housing, medical and senior living property types. Turning to public markets. Multi-asset net flows were $8 billion driven by positive net flows in the Franklin Income Fund, Canvas and Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. On Slide 18, you can see equity sales improved each quarter this year and grew 53% year-over-year, excluding reinvested distributions. In addition, fixed income long-term inflows increased year-over-year by 26%. Now turning to Western Asset. As you are aware, we launched an internal investigation focusing on certain tax trade allocations of treasury derivatives by former Co-CIO, Ken Leech, in select Western Asset-managed strategies. The DOJ, SEC and CFTC are conducting parallel investigation, and those investigations are ongoing. On August 21, we announced that Ken Leech was on a leave of absence following receipt of a Wells notice from the SEC. We take this matter extremely seriously and are fully cooperating with the government. Since the announcement of the investigations, Western Asset has experienced significantly higher net outflows of $37 billion in the fourth quarter and $49 billion for the fiscal year. However, today, the Western team of more than 100 highly experienced investment professionals led by Mike Buchanan, who was promoted the sole CIO from Co-CIO, continues to manage approximately $330 billion in AUM across 88 marketed strategies. The team continues to focus on investment performance and providing leading client service. Mike has been with Western nearly 2 decades and has over 3 decades of industry experience. Since the beginning of the investigations, Western Asset's trading policies have been reviewed by third-party experts. Per this review, despite being aligned with industry standards, Western has further enhanced its trading policies and practices. In addition, Franklin Resources is working with Western's management team to explore ways to assist Western Asset, including adjustments to economic arrangements, operational and revenue synergies. This may entail changes that are similar to what we have successfully implemented with our other public market specialist investment managers, while maintaining investment process independence. And I'm sure that you understand with an ongoing investigation, we are unable to provide any further information or address questions on this matter at this time. Aside from Western Assets, we think it's important to highlight the breadth of our fixed income investment management expertise, including Franklin Templeton fixed income, Brandywine Global and Templeton Global Macro, which have non-correlated investment philosophies. As of September 30, these specialist investment teams managed in aggregate $266 billion in fixed income assets and generated positive net flows of $6.4 billion in the fiscal year. Furthermore, Franklin Templeton fixed income comprised the largest component of our won but not yet funded pipeline. Speaking of the pipeline, this quarter, our institutional pipeline of won but unfunded mandates was $15.8 billion. While new wins replenished our fundings, the $2 billion decrease from the prior quarter included a change in value in a client mandate at Western. The pipeline remains diversified by asset class and across our specialist investment managers. Finally, this year, we acquired Putnam Investments, which has exceeded our expectations. Since closing on January 1, Putnam's AUM has grown 21% to $180 billion. Putnam continues to deliver a strong track record of investment performance. The transaction also enhanced our presence in retirement and insurance markets with AUM in these channels at $645 billion. Let me wrap up by saying, we take pride in the efforts we've made over past few years to further grow and diversify our business. We have navigated challenges, created new opportunities and uphold the high standards that have defined us for over 75 years. Finally, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their unwavering dedication and commitment to always putting our clients first. It's their hard work that is the driving force behind our success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO and COO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results for the fiscal quarter and year. Matt, over to you. Matt Nicholls : Thank you, Jenny. Turning to the financial results for the fourth quarter. Ending AUM reached $1.68 trillion, reflecting an increase of 2% from the prior quarter, and average AUM was $1.67 trillion, also a 2% increase from the prior quarter. Adjusted operating revenues increased by 4% to $1.7 billion from the prior quarter due to higher average AUM and higher adjusted performance fees. Adjusted performance fees were $72 million, compared to $57 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's adjusted effective fee rate, which excludes performance fees, stayed relatively flat at 37.4 basis points compared to 37.5 basis points in the prior quarter. Our adjusted operating expenses were $1.3 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter due to higher incentive compensation, advertising and professional fees. This quarter, we realized $38 million of Putnam-related cost savings, representing $6 million of incremental cost savings from the prior quarter. As a result, adjusted operating income increased 6% from the prior quarter to $452 million. And adjusted operating margin increased to 26.3% from 25.7%. Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 3% and 2% from the prior quarter to $315 million and $0.59, respectively primarily due to a higher tax rate from discrete tax expenses in the current quarter and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by higher operating income. As of September 30th, we impaired the intangible asset related to certain mutual fund contracts managed by Western Asset and recognized a $389.2 million non-cash charge in our GAAP results, primarily due to the decreased AUM resulting from net client outflows and lower discounted future cash flows generated from these management contracts. Turning to fiscal year 2024. Ending AUM was $1.68 trillion, reflecting an increase of 22% from the prior year, while average AUM increased 12% to $1.57 trillion. Our fiscal year reflects nine months of Putnam financials. Adjusted operating revenues of $6.6 billion increased by 8% from the prior year, primarily due to Putnam and higher average AUM, partially offset by lower performance fees. Adjusted performance fees of $293 million decreased from $383 million in the prior year. The adjusted effective fee rate, which excludes performance fees, was 38.3 basis points compared to 39.5 basis points in the prior year. Drivers of the decrease included the impact of 0.3 basis points from the transaction-related investment management fees and 0.2 basis points catch-up fees in secondary private equity last year and 0.1 basis points from the addition of Putnam this year. Our adjusted operating expenses were $4.9 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior year, primarily due to nine months of Putnam, higher incentive compensation, double rent related to the consolidation of our New York City office space, and higher legal fees, primarily due to the Western Asset matter. In addition, as anticipated, over $150 million of annual run rate cost saves related to Putnam were achieved by year end. This led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 6% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 26.1% compared to 29.9% in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income declined by 4% to $1.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.39, a decline of 8%. The decreases were primarily due to the decline in operating income and a higher tax rate, partially offset by higher investment income. From a capital management perspective, we returned $946 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, funded acquisitions, and paid down a $250 million senior note in July. Stepping back, as we look over the last five years, we delivered a predictable capital management policy and prioritized returning capital to our shareholders, totaling over $4 billion, including $3 billion in dividends and $1.1 billion in share repurchases. Our dividend, which has increased every year since 1981, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4%. Our balance sheet provides flexibility to invest in the growth of our business organically and inorganically. We have co-investments in seed capital of $2.4 billion to develop and scale new products. Additionally, the acquisitions we've made since 2019 represent 55% of our adjusted operating revenue and meaningfully contribute to our operating cash flow. Importantly, these investments provide new sources of growth and relevance to our clients. In addition, while continuing to invest in long-term growth initiatives, we also continue to strengthen the foundation of our business through disciplined expense management and operational efficiencies, especially given the ongoing transformation of our industry. Over the last five years, we've created operational efficiencies, both at the enterprise level as well as broader efforts to enhance synergies across our specialist investment managers. For example, we have outsourced our fund administration and our global transfer agency. In addition, we have achieved targeted cost savings ahead of schedule as seen in our acquisitions of Legg Mason and Putnam. Looking ahead, we plan to further simplify our firm-wide operations, including the previously announced unification of our investment management technology on a single platform across our public market specialist investment managers. Before I turn to guidance, a brief update on preliminary October flows. As we will announce next week in our monthly AUM reporting, Franklin expects to report slight long-term net outflows for October, excluding Western Asset. Western's long-term net outflows in October are expected to be $18 billion. For Western, this follows long-term net outflows of $7.7 billion in billion in August and $27.9 September. As previously announced, excluding Western, Franklin had $5.7 billion in long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter. Turning to guidance for the next fiscal quarter. Guidance assumes flat markets is based on our best estimates as of today and does not include the impact of any possible future developments from the Western investigations. We expect our EFR to be in the mid-37 basis point area, but slightly higher than this past quarter, excluding adjusted performance fees. We expect compensation and benefits to be $860 million. This assumes $50 million of performance fees. Please also note that, this includes $45 million annual accelerated deferred compensation. The prior year quarter included $41 million of such accelerated deferred compensation. For IS&T, we're guiding to $155 million to $160 million, inclusive of $4 million higher spend for Gen AI and our investment management platform. We expect occupancy to be flat between $78 million and $80 million, inclusive of double rent related to our transition to a more efficient and unified space in New York City. As previously explained, the double rent will begin to phase out in the second half of fiscal year 2025. G&A expense is expected to be in the $180 million area and includes slightly higher legal fees. In terms of our GAAP tax rate, we expect fiscal 2025 to stay in the same range of 24% to 26%. But note that, our first quarter typically has a higher tax rate due to discrete items related to deferred compensation vesting. And now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. I appreciate that you can't speak particularly to WAMCO. I certainly understand that. I guess I'm intrigued by your commentary of potentially revamping some of the economic relationships with the franchise. I was wondering if you could potentially flesh that out a little bit. And then separately, I'm wondering whether or not the WAMCO overhang is affecting gross sales in any of the segments. It's not clear from what you're sharing, but I'm sort of wondering at the margin, what you're hearing on the institutional side, in particular, given the ongoing investigation? Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Great. Thanks, Bill. So, so far, the outflows even within Western, I think it's like 72% are focused on essentially core, core plus and macro ops. So even within Western, it's pretty focused on those strategies. They're about $90 billion today. Since Ken received as well notice, Western's had outflows of $53.6 billion. So there are some instances at Western where clients who were in other strategies just didn't -- we were concerned about the headline risk and did actually redeem. But I think it's been fairly controlled there. And we have not seen it really flow over into the other Franklin strategies. It's definitely part of the conversations, but it hasn't had a tremendous impact on the other strategies. Matt, I'll have you kind of answer the question around how we're approaching and thinking about the economic relationship. And to remind you, Bill, the relationship with Western is pretty unique. I always say you can't do hostile acquisitions in the asset management business because it's all about the people and their investment process. And Western was fairly unique for us in this five year autonomous arrangement that we had. But obviously, in light of current situations that we're just having a conversation around how we should think about that. Our model in general is we always apply common sense. It's slightly different. There's no exact one size fits all. Even today, Templeton and Mutual Series, which were acquired in the '90s have slightly different models with us. For example, one insists on the trading folks, their traders to be on their desk others use our global trading platform. So we always try to have a practical approach. But Matt, do you want to take kind of the specific conversations around it? Matt Nicholls : Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Jenny. Thanks, Bill. So maybe I think your question gets to a couple of things. First of all, economic arrangements but also economics related to the situation through Western. So perhaps for perspective, I'll just start by saying that the press tends to report that Western Asset is our largest specialist investment manager, but that's just by AUM. I think you know that, Bill, along with everybody else that covers us. But obviously, a much more important measure, the key measure, of course, is financial contribution of the business. And so I think it's worthwhile going through this a little bit and explain that, for example, in terms of adjusted operating revenue on a run rate basis, Western is probably something like our fifth or sixth largest specialist investment manager. And on the impact so far, if you run rate the $53 billion of outflows that Western has experienced since August, Western's annualized revenues would be expected to be declining by about 20% so far. That's just the Western revenue, which equates to about 2% decline at the Franklin Resources level. Obviously, operating income impact will initially be higher, this is to your point on margin, will initially be higher because expenses are not able to be reduced at the same rate as revenue. But importantly, at Franklin Resources, we have areas that can help achieve some of the offsets over time such as, as we talked about on this call, the addition of Putnam, growth in alternative assets, ETFs, SMAs, Canvas, our large equities business, our other fixed income SIMs, international and so on in addition to the expense discipline and other levers that we have. But look, this doesn't mean for a second that this is not important to us. It's very important to us. Western has hundreds of hardworking long-term employees with families, a strong investment team with a long-term track record. As Jenny has mentioned, together with producing good investment outcomes for clients, it's a team approach. And under CIO, Mike Buchanan, they're very focused on investment performance and client service. Our north star, if you will, has always been to achieve sustainable growth across our whole company. And Western is important to this, and this has certainly been a dent in that progress as you can see from the results we're highlighting today. But as Jenny said, this is exactly why we're working with Western management on providing assistance where possible, in particular, keeping the investment team in a good place while management works through this. So in summary, the economic arrangement that we have with Western over these five years, that's going to have to be adjusted to accommodate a decline in the revenue and the operating income, and that's what we're working through right now. Adam Spector : And Bill, I would add one thing you asked about institutional flows in general. We have really worked hard over the last two years to build better relationships with institutions around the globe. If you take a look at where we were last year, ex-Western last fiscal year, we raised $2.2 billion in the institutional channel. This year, that net number more than doubled to $5.6 billion. So we're feeling actually quite positive about the trajectory of that institutional business. Bill Katz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Budish : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about one of your five-year target, the $100 billion of fundraising across private markets. Could you unpack that a little bit? Just how much do you expect to come from, say, cross-selling across the investment managers you've acquired over the last several years? How much is predicated on future M&A? How much do you think will come from the retail versus wealth channel? Any more details around that target would be appreciated. Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Sure. So let me start. The focus on that is actually from our existing managers, and just to give you a perspective on the growth that we've had since we acquired BSP, they doubled in size. Clarion's up just under 40%. Lexington, I think we've only owned them for about two years, and they're up a little under 30%. So we've been successful in growing those, and our projections of the $100 billion comes from really looking at what those opportunities are. Just to give you a little guidance for 2025. So last year, in 2024, we gave a range of $10 billion to $15 billion in sales and achieved $14.8 billion. This year, we're saying, we think it will be between $13 billion and $20 billion in gross sales. And that comes from real estate, secondaries, private credit and ventures, so all those are bottoms up build to net. And the reason the range is fairly large is, it will really depend on whether Lexington is able to do a first close of their flagship once they decide on the timing of their Lexington flagship 11 Fund. So far, Fund 10, they've been able to deploy it faster and at higher discounts than historical levels. So we're hopeful that we'll be in the market and do a first close. But that's obviously a big portion of that number. It also depends on real estate coming back in favor. We think the signs are all showing that the winter of real estate may be over and that we should see things picking back up next calendar year. And we have some, I think, a really diverse set of offerings that are coming out in the market. So not only does Lexington have their flagship fund, but we think continuation vehicles are going to be a more and more important area. We're launching a perpetual vehicle in the wealth channel, which is something very new. We think that opens up a lot of opportunities. They've, obviously, been doing their co-investment middle market. So Lexington is going to have a lot more offerings in market. We're also launching a real estate debt fund. If you look at private credit, there's probably a lot of areas that people would say, private credit is getting pretty tight in some of the spreads. But it happens to be that BSP has a real expertise in real estate debt. They have about $10 billion or $9 billion that they manage there today. And we think with the regional banks pulling back in this area that, that's going to be a really interesting opportunity. It's unclear whether it's going to be part of the real estate portfolio allocation or the private credit allocation. But we think that has a lot of great demand there. So if you think about just in 2025 that, that ranges from $13 billion to $20 billion, we feel comfortable in the projection over the next five years to hit that $100 billion number. Benjamin Budish : All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Matt, I wanted to follow-up just on the context of fiscal 2025 and just the outlook for expenses. I know there's a lot of moving parts with the Western dynamics. But could you talk about core expense growth and either contextualize with or without Western in terms of what legal or unknowns might come through to think about the growth in the expense base for the core business? Matt Nicholls : Yeah. Morning, Dan. So look, obviously, it's super early for the year. I gave guidance on call -- on our, sorry, prepared remarks for the quarter. But if I think through the year, if you normalize for a full year of Putnam and exclude performance fees and with the same caveats I gave in my prepared remarks around the Western situation, we would expect expenses to be quite similar to the last fiscal year. In general, we would expect revenue loss from Western to be made up from other areas of growth that justifies that expense base. Obviously, if we experience a decline in any part of our business, well, that will be offset by very careful expense management. We have a number of initiatives going on, as we've already highlighted, across our investment management platform, operations, certain levels of integration. All that help participate in our ability to pull certain levers to manage either expected or unexpected reductions in revenue or increase in investments that we need to make across the business. So again, I'd say just very carefully and cautiously, all else remaining equal and normalizing for a full year of Putnam excluding performance fees that plus the caveats I gave on my prepared remarks that we would expect our expenses to be substantially similar to the last fiscal year that we just closed. And I think that's the best way of looking at it right now, so expense growth remaining very much in check. Dan Fannon : Great. That's helpful. But just to clarify, what would be one quarter of Putnam just to think so we can kind of normalize for the 9 to 12 months to kind of get to a dollar amount? Matt Nicholls : One quarter of Putnam expenses will be -- wait 1 second, like $125 million. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for the new PowerPoint deck presentation disclosure there across. Appreciate that. Just as we think about your targets and objectives over the next 5 years, just curious what that would translate into in terms of revenue, operating income and EPS in 5 years' time? And what sort of growth might that be when you sort of pull it all together? And then if maybe you could just remind us, how much Western contributes to AUM revenues and operating income today. Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Yes. I mean, Western's contribution is probably right now on a run rate basis, around 9% -- 8%, 9% of our adjusted operating revenues. In terms of operating income, it's a little bit more than that. But as I mentioned a moment ago, it's moved to being much closer to it. So we're working through those things as we speak, as I mentioned earlier and as Jenny touched on. In terms of our organic growth trajectory, what we're hoping to achieve is to get into the low single digits growth on average as a business. We're obviously not there now because of some of the issues we're working through on the Western side that we've been very transparent about. But also, look, the -- you know, Mike, better than most the industry trends. And when you look at where we were five years ago and where we are today, we're a much more balanced business. I mean five years ago, a very large portion of our business was in mutual funds retail distribution in the United States. We're extremely different business now, but we still have to work through achieving scale in the areas of investment. So we've talked about ETFs. We talked about Canvas. We talked about alternative assets. We talked about other areas of the firm that we're growing. A number of these things aren't really scaled yet to the degree that we expect them to be, given the investment we're putting in. That's why we put a five-year timeline on some of these things because it takes time to get there. Once we get there, we think it's very reasonable that notwithstanding some of the areas of shrinkage that we could be a low single digit growth business overall, the whole -- including the whole franchise. And obviously, they're taking out the Western situations getting through that and normalizing our revenue as it was before that and then looking at the areas of growth versus the areas of shrinkage and the overall business that we have under the hood here. But I don't know whether, Jenny, do you want to add anything to that? Jenny Johnson : Well, I was just going to say -- no, I think you hit it right, but just one additional. Without Western's outflows, I think our organic growth rate runs at about 1.3%. And when you do the kind of acquisitions that we've done and you really try to put together a best athlete team, the reality is it takes time for distribution to settle in. Because even if you take, say, the best salesperson in a region, you're actually breaking relationships with some other people. So it takes time. And even with Putnam, we took on a lot of the Putnam team, and so part of this is kind of digesting that. And then as Matt said, you take our ETFs. We've talked about how over the last eight quarters, we had $1 billion. But actually, in the last two quarters, our ETFs had over $3 billion in net flows. And they're up 88%, but there's still only $31 billion. So that's a fast-growing important area. We think we have a great team, great products. We were not late to the active ETF game. So we think we have good opportunities there. And then I look at it and say, if you think about the big trends that are so important, the fact that that we have the breadth of capabilities in the private markets as well as the capabilities we have on the traditional market, I don't think there's another asset manager that has that same kind of capability. And then you combine it with the fact that we have $500 billion sourced from clients outside the United States, we sell over $80 billion outside the US, which is tremendous. It takes decades to build those kind of relationships and reputation in various markets. And then one thing that I think people don't fully understand is we're pretty unusual and unique in the local asset management capability. You go into a new market, and 80% of flows tend to go into domestic products. India, we are the first foreign manager, but we launched domestic products in India. We are viewed as a local player competing against local asset managers. And this year, we raised our largest equity fund there with -- and we haven't done it in 15 years. Mexico, Middle East, in the Middle East, we've been there for 25 years. But interestingly, we're actually one of the largest Islamic finance managers, global asset managers for Shariah and Sukuk. And so as the Middle East becomes more and more important, we can serve both global products as well as local capabilities. And then we also have local asset management in places like Canada, the U.K., Australia. So, again, if you're a global provider, you tend to go with global products. But we've always also focused on this ability to deliver local. And we think international, when you look at the demographics of the emerging economies, to be considered a local player in these markets is really powerful. So, I just wanted to add that on top of Matt's points. Adam Spector : And Jenny, the only thing I would add to that is it's starting a little earlier. We now are building scale in a lot of areas that you mentioned, especially in things like private markets in the wealth channel, we started with institutional quality managers. We built up all specialists to cover that channel. That team is now 85 people strong, not only in the U.S. but in EMEA, in APAC and in the Americas. And when we go to market in those channels, we've learned it's important to come in scale. So, now we have evergreen products in real estate, in private credit, in secondaries. And all of those products are coming with scale, which will really allow us to accelerate our efforts in that channel. Jenny Johnson : Yes. And actually, you just reminded me just one last thing is that we mentioned it in the opening comments, but like the Franklin equity team has been doing late-stage venture in their mutual funds for over a decade. It actually is really a complicated thing to do. And so our ability, as the world starts to converge with public and private products, our ability to do that with the capabilities, I think of it as the ingredients we have as a firm, I think, are really tremendous. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks so much for all the color. Matt Nicholls : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Dunn with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Dunn : Hi thanks. Maybe just a quick one on wanting to double in the private wealth management. Has there been a kind of change? Or could you describe the appetite for firms to join your platform? And how aggressive do you think you'll be over the next several years? Matt Nicholls : Yes, I think you think about -- sure. Where we first started was with [indiscernible], a Clarion product. And we just had a very few partners in that space for that evergreen. We're now up to over 20 partners there. So, we see that we're able to onboard to far more platforms, and that's really helping us. The other thing we've been able to do in that that channel is to co-develop products with our wealth management partners, which means we have a little more backing, and we're able to get in the calendar earlier. That was bigger a lesson for us as well as getting on the calendar early. And finally, I would say, scale. In the mutual fund world, you can start smaller, work your way up. What we found in the private asset area was that it was important to come to market with scale from the beginning to be able to offer a diversified product. And that requires really sourcing significant AUM at the very beginning of the launch and we've been able to do all of those things. So, feel good about the launch of our evergreen in the wealth management channel. And Matthew, do you want to add anything there? Matt Nicholls : Yes, the only thing I'll add is I think part of John's question may have been about Fiduciary trust and our growth targets as it relates to our own wealth management business. And what I'd say, John, is in that front -- on that front, Fiduciary is a full-scale platform. It's a great business. It's grown quite nicely over the last several years. And as we focus so much on building out our asset management business, we haven't really turned much attention to what else we could do with that very valuable platform that we have. So our intention is, as Jenny mentioned in her prepared remarks, is to capitalize on that business that we have and spend more time attracting teams to join that platform. When we've done that, we've been quite successful doing it. And the teams have done well on the platform and grown and help the overall business growth. So what we need to do is over the next year or two really focus on how we can turn that into a natural sort of strategic operation, if you will, in terms of having people on the team, bringing new teams over and join the platform so we can grow that out. John Dunn : Got it. Thanks very much. Matt Nicholls : It's got all the resources that any wealth manager would need to offer their clients. John Dunn : Got it. Thanks. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO, for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Great. Well, everybody, thanks for participating in today's call. And I just, again, want to thank all of the Franklin Templeton employees for all their hard work and dedication as well as the Western employees, who are particularly working hard and focusing on their clients and delivering continuing improving and very good performance despite all the distractions. And I just will say, we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Chief Communications Officer and Head of Investor Relations for Franklin Resources. Thank you. You may begin.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Johnson : Thank you, Selene. Welcome and thank you for joining us to discuss Franklin Templeton's -- fiscal quarter results. I'm here with Matt Nicholls, our CFO and COO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution. We'll answer your questions shortly, but first I will review the quarter's highlights. Over the past few months, I've traveled across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and met with key clients ranging from wealth clients to institutions and sovereign wealth funds to other large asset owners. What's clear to me from these conversations is that clients want deeper relationships with fewer asset managers that can meet more of their needs. As one of the few global asset managers with extensive public and private market strategies, we believe we are well-positioned to be a trusted advisor to our clients around the world. In recent years, we have intentionally diversified our company across specialist investment managers, asset classes, vehicles and geographies to benefit a broad range of clients through various market conditions and cycles. Ever since we opened our first offices outside of North America 40 years ago, our global presence and perspective has been a strategic advantage, enabling us to reach new investors. Today, our global footprint includes offices in over 30 countries, serving clients in over 150, and represents approximately $475 billion in assets under management. During our first fiscal quarter, market volatility ticked higher with geopolitical uncertainty, the U.S. Presidential election, central bank actions, and inflation. Starting with public equity markets, global equities fell by about 1% during the quarter, while the S&P 500 posted a total return of 2.4%, and the NASDAQ 100 notched a 5% gain. The U.S. equity markets saw positive returns while other regions like Europe, the U.K., Japan, China and emerging markets faced pressure in part due to the U.S. Presidential election results, trade tariff concerns, and economic growth uncertainties. While equity markets' returns were a bit more modest than the three previous quarters, the major trends remained in place. The U.S. large caps outperforming U.S. small caps driven by technology and communications services firms. Growth stocks in the U.S. outperformed value stocks for both the quarter and the year. The largest gains came from tech and consumer, while materials and health care lagged. International equity markets stalled in Q4, but still delivered positive returns for the year. In the coming year, our investment management teams believe that earnings growth is likely to support higher valuations across global equity markets, with the U.S. continuing to lead the way. We also believe that dispersion within global equity markets will continue to increase, meaning that top performers should come from more than just mega cap tech companies. And we've seen signs of this starting to play out in the December quarter and more pronounced this week as DeepSeek raised questions about the race to capture value from AI. This dispersion favors active management and the ability to move quickly in today's dynamic markets. Valuations are likely to come more into focus, and skilled active managers can identify mispriced securities to generate alpha. It's also a reminder that investors should focus on balance and diversification of their portfolios. Meanwhile, turning to the rate market, investor focus is centered on two issues, the inflation picture and uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new U.S. administration. Following robust U.S. growth numbers and relatively sticky inflation data, we expect the Fed to adopt a prudent pause in its easing over the next several months, something the markets may have overestimated. Early U.S. government economic policy moves, especially on regulations and tariffs, could solidify expectations of sustained robust growth, which in turn would point to some inflationary pressures. We see uncertainty remaining elevated for a while as markets try to anticipate U.S. fiscal policy and distinguish between rhetoric and reality regarding proposed tariffs. So what does this mean for fixed income markets? The yield curve continues to steepen and over time investors will benefit from going up the curve. As the Fed's rate cutting cycle seems close to an end, traditional fixed income sectors are regaining their role as a primary source for yield. Given the still robust pace of activity in spread sectors, our fixed income managers continue to find opportunities at attractive yields even as spreads remain relatively tight. Turning to the private markets. As valuations have reset from their 2021 levels, we believe that allocating capital in the coming year looks attractive across much of the private market ecosystem. Specifically, we see opportunities in secondaries, real estate equity and real estate debt. We believe funds that deploy capital in today's market environment can negotiate favorable pricing, terms and covenants. With product evolution making these investments more accessible to a larger group of investors, and with more flexible features, financial professionals are increasingly allocating client assets in these versatile and valuable strategies. A tremendous opportunity exists with global money market assets at record highs of $8.9 trillion as of December 31, according to Morningstar. Investors who have sat on the sidelines have not been able to capture significant returns over the past couple of years. As one of the world's most comprehensive asset managers, our broad investment capabilities, extensive global distribution network, and local asset management expertise continue to differentiate us in an increasingly competitive industry and allow us to be well-positioned to capture money in motion. In fact, just this week, we were appointed as trustee and manager of the National Investment Fund of Uzbekistan. We are pleased to partner with the government of Uzbekistan in support of the development of their local capital markets. For over 15 years, we have actively managed similar specialized merging markets mandates, including Fondul, a London and Bucharest listed Romanian closed-end fund. Turning now to our business. Our first fiscal quarter results demonstrated progress across our key growth areas, enabling us to meet the needs of our clients amid heightened market volatility. Our AUM continues to be well diversified across asset class, client type and region, and ended the quarter at $1.58 trillion, a decrease from the prior quarter due to negative markets and long-term net outflows from Western Asset. Excluding reinvested distributions, long-term inflows improved by 34% from the prior year quarter. Long-term net outflows were $50 billion, including $20 billion of reinvested distributions. Excluding Western Asset Management, our long-term net inflows were approximately $18 billion and positive in every asset class. Three of our asset classes, Equity, Multi-Asset and Alternatives, generated a combined $17 billion in positive net flows. Equity net inflows were $12.5 billion and included reinvested distributions of $16.5 billion. We saw positive net flows into large cap value, smart beta quantitative, listed infrastructure, and all cap core strategies. Investment performance continues to be strong across all periods as investors return to risk assets. Fixed income net outflows were $66.7 billion. Excluding Western, fixed income net inflows were positive into multi-sector, core bond and high yield strategies. As highlighted on previous calls, we benefit from our broad range of fixed income strategies with non-correlated investment philosophies. Brandywine Global and FT fixed income both generated positive net flows, totaling a combined $1 billion in fixed income strategies in the quarter. This past year has presented significant challenges for Western Asset Management, and we're committed to supporting them. In the near-term, we will integrate select corporate functions, creating efficiencies and giving access to broader resources, while ensuring Western's investment team autonomy. These enhancements will be seamless for clients. This quarter, fundraising and alternatives generated $6 billion, of which private market assets totaled $4.3 billion. Aggregate realizations and distributions were $3.8 billion. In January, we launched our first Evergreen Secondaries Private Equity Fund, the Franklin-Lexington Private Markets Fund, designed for the wealth channel. The fund achieved an initial fundraising cap of $900 million in assets under management. We have also launched a parallel product internationally. Today, our Evergreen funds are reaching an important milestone of nearly $1 billion in AUM for each of our alternative managers. Franklin Lexington Private Markets Fund in Secondary Private Equity, BSP Real Estate Debt, and Clarion Partners Real Estate Income Fund. These are semi-liquid perpetual vehicles and we look forward to further capital subscriptions. These are great examples of how our wealth management alternatives business, Alternatives by Franklin Templeton, has all the essential elements to win in this space. Over the past few years, we have focused on designing innovative, suitable products, investing in client education and supporting wealth advisors. Our large local distribution coverage model is comprised of a dedicated alternative specialist team that works with our overall sales force. The wealth channel is approximately 10% of our alternative AUM. Looking ahead, as allocation to alternatives increase and we launch products in the channel, we expect wealth clients to gradually grow to represent 20% to 30% of our alternative capital raises. Multi-Asset net inflows were $3.4 billion led by Franklin Income Fund, our custom indexing platform Canvas, and Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. Income and yield continue to be top of mind for investors. Franklin Income Fund's flexible approach enables it to invest in dividend-paying stocks, bonds and convertible securities and is a great example of a strategy in high demand across multiple geographies and in different vehicles. The Investment Solutions team leverages a global network of investment teams across our specialist investment managers to offer innovative and diversified strategies, including private strategies and ended the quarter with $88 billion in AUM. Turning to investment vehicles. Clients showed interest in a diverse range of investment options, including ETFs, retail SMAs and Canvas. Our ETF business saw its 13th consecutive quarter of positive net flows, attracting $2.7 billion during Q1. 9 of our ETFs now are over $1 billion in AUM. From an asset class perspective, 8 of these nine funds are equity strategies, and the largest ETF being Franklin U.S. Core Bond with $2.3 billion in assets. Retail SMA AUM was $146 billion, and excluding Western had net inflows of $2.5 billion. Canvas, a web-based software platform, allows financial professionals to create personalized SMAs for their clients, including tax-managed, efficient products, and has enhanced our leadership in SMAs. Through the use of technology, we continue to partner closely with clients to develop personalized portfolio solutions. Canvas had record net flows of $900 million with AUM of $10.5 billion, a 10% increase from the prior quarter. At quarter end, our institutional pipeline of one, but unfunded mandates increased by $2.3 billion to $18.1 billion in AUM and remains diversified across asset classes and specialist investment managers. Despite the challenges with Western, fixed income mandates have grown and now represent 45% of the pipeline. Before I turn to investment performance, I wanted to provide a brief update on Western Asset Management. In the quarter, Western experienced significantly higher long-term net outflows of $68 billion, of which $38 billion of it occurred in the month of December. By December 31, Western Asset managed $272 billion in AUM across 88 marketed strategies. While it's preliminary, as we report January AUM inflows next week, Western's long-term net outflows are expected to be approximately $17 billion for the month of January and had AUM of approximately $260 billion. Excluding Western, we expect long-term net inflows of approximately $4.5 billion. Now, in terms of investment performance, our investment teams have remained true to their distinct disciplines and time-tested approaches and continue to produce competitive investment returns. Mutual fund investment performance improved in the 3 and 5-year periods from the prior quarter across all asset classes was unchanged for the 10-year period and the modest decline in the 1-year period was primarily due to U.S equity strategies. Two-thirds of mutual fund AUM outperformed their respective peers over the 3-year period. Compared to the prior quarter, composite investment performance improved in the 3-year period, stayed relatively flat in the 10-year period, and declined in the 1 and 5-year periods. More than half of the AUM and our strategy composites are beating their respective benchmarks for the 3 and 5-year periods, and 63% in the 10-year period. Turning briefly to financial results, adjusted operating income was $412.8 million, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter, and a decrease of 1% from the prior year quarter. In connection with Western, and as a whole, we will be implementing additional cost savings initiatives during fiscal 2025, of which the benefits will be realized in fiscal 2026. We remain committed to our long-term vision of strategically investing in the business to best serve our clients, while managing expenses and maintaining our focus on enhancing shareholder value. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the many opportunities we have to drive growth and innovation. With a clear vision and strong progress already underway, we're focused on elevating the performance of our investment strategies, outstanding client experience, and continued growth in our most critical areas. This month, we announced the launch of an exciting new U.S advertising campaign, \"your trusted partner for what's ahead\". This campaign highlights Franklin Templeton's rich legacy of evolving with our clients' needs, while showcasing the breadth of our capabilities for financial professionals. Some of the highlighted capabilities include our public and alternative investments, customized solutions, Canvas, ETFs and SMAs. Finally, in December, Franklin Templeton was recognized again as one of the best places to work in money management by Pension and Investments. I'm proud to lead such talented and dedicated employees who work tirelessly on behalf of our clients. And I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to our organization. Now let's open up the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Since there is only one per person for now, maybe we will start with Western. Appreciate the update on AUM and obviously outflows in January continues to be obviously a pretty challenging picture, but can you help us frame the operating income and management fee contribution from Western, kind of where that stands today? And I guess more importantly, I know it is going to be hard to ring fence where this whole thing ultimately ends up in terms of size, but what is kind of the strategic vision for Western, however much smaller it gets from here? So I know you talked about integrating some of the selected corporate functions. What kind of savings do you anticipate from that and just maybe help us think about what Western could look like over the next couple of quarters as things settle down? Jenny Johnson : Thanks, Alex. I'll address a little bit on the strategic side and then turn over to Matt on kind of the financial framing. Look, our model has always been that we support the independence of the investment teams and we integrate kind of the rest of the business at the center. And obviously we've done a lot of acquisitions over the past 5 years, and it takes time to do that. And as you know, Western was independent. But that's what the initiative is, is to basically maintain the independence of that investment team and things like fund accounting, even the technology and other areas. And we're looking at all this to integrate it into the broader firm so that we get greater scale, we can make investments in things like AI and data. And so it's really a natural evolution of that, and that work is underway. And, Matt, you want to talk about the impact? Matt Nicholls : Yes, yes. Good morning, Alex. So, in terms of financial impact of Western, I'll mention a couple of things, then put it into context, talking about the annual impact through '25 and then into '26. I think that's probably the most useful way of looking at it. So, in terms of financial impact, if you run rate the current revenue impact of Western outflows of approximately $120 billion, this is from August through to the end of January, it equates to about 30% of Western's full year '24 adjusted revenue. That equates to about 3% -- 3% of Franklin's full year '24 adjusted revenue. The run rate remaining revenue of Western equates to about a 6% of Franklin's adjusted revenue. The impact on operating income will obviously be greater, as I mentioned in the last quarter, for a period of time, given that expenses need to catch up with revenue declines, and we're being, as Jenny mentioned, supportive, methodical, but that shouldn't be confused with not being disciplined. We're being super disciplined about how we tackle this. Top of mind, though, is to ensure continued excellence in terms of client experience with Western and obviously all of Franklin. So specifically, as Jenny mentioned, Franklin Resources is assisting significantly by accelerating the end of our 5-year autonomous agreement with Western, which expires in July this year. This will enable us to implement the integration of certain corporate functions that Jenny referenced that will result in Western being able to capture the benefits of a much larger scaled asset management operation, while again, as Jenny mentioned, retaining investment team autonomy. I think in terms of the sort of margin impact, it's important to look at the year. We do expect our expenses for the year to be, if you normalize for a full year of Putnam and then exclude performance fees, we expect it to be roughly even with last year, very similar to last year's expenses, let's say adjusted expenses. We continue to make important strategic investments and funding, then with cost saved elsewhere in the business. We expect the impact of our support of Western and integration of certain functions of Western to reduce our margin by a little bit in the short-term, let's say over the next quarter also and then experience margin expansion again in fiscal 2026, remembering that starts for us in October, October 1. For further perspective, which is why normally we wouldn't talk about 2026, but in this context, I think it's important to explain it. For further perspective, we expect our expense initiatives that we're working on now in 2025 to position us to enter fiscal '26 with the equivalent of about $200 million to $250 million of expense run rate expense reductions. You asked about the effective fee rate of Western Asset. It's currently 16.5 basis points. In general, obviously, look, we don't give revenue guides. All of this assumes flat markets, but we do expect the lower fee revenue from Western to be replaced over time with other areas of growth, which Jenny referenced on her prepared remarks, , Franklin Fixed Income, Alternatives, ETFs, Campus Solutions, and even other pockets of growth within Western itself. And that obviously will add to the margin recovery. So this is sort of a two-pronged thing. You have obviously expense discipline and expense reductions that will happen, start to begin in 2025, but the effect on our margin, the positive effects on our margin, margin expansion won't happen until you get into 2026. And then obviously another layer of margin expansion is on the revenue side that I just mentioned. And then, finally, we gave margin guidance or margin targets, let's say, at our year-end call, and we referenced a medium-term target of 30%. And that remains exactly the same. We're not changing any of the targets that we talked about at year end. Jenny Johnson : I'm just going to add one other thing, Alex, because you asked about kind of strategic. Having nothing to do with the issues at Western at the moment, we remiss in not acknowledging just how much the fixed income landscape has changed, and that that may then trigger kind of a look over time at how you're structured. So what do I mean by that? Let's face it, banks don't play the same traditional role. They're not obviously lending in the same way that they used to. If you talk to private credit managers, often their number one focus is sourcing of deals as opposed to just raising money. So if you think about that function becoming more important in private credit, you can imagine as you're building those sourcing relationships, like BSP has a lot of relationships with middle market companies and obviously sponsored firms, IPO or PE firms. As you build that, you can see how that evolves in the conversation becomes, well, if you want to do private, this is what the structure looks like. If you want to do traditional fixed income, this is what it looks like. And so that is something that we are thinking about. That is not a, there's no kind of organizational impacts or things in '25 and maybe not even in '26, but it is something that we are -- as we look at ourselves as -- somewhere around a $500 billion fixed income manager with all these different groups, what should the right structure ultimately be. Alexander Blostein : Great. Yes, that's really helpful detail. Thank you both. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. So a lot there in the first response. So just to follow-up, just to make sure I understand, the 200 to 250 of additional savings, that is going to be beyond the flat, including Putnam for fiscal 2025. So as we think about 2026, you'll have natural growth plus that savings that should be for the full year. Matt Nicholls : Right. But -- it's correct, but if you -- if we have flat markets from today, we're not going to increase our expenses for 2025. It would be flat to down a little bit. So the 250 is incremental to that for 2026. And we would expect to have a full 250 for 2026. In other words, the work to achieve those cost savings, from a run rate perspective, we would expect that to be starting in October 1 in earnest. Dan Fannon : Great. That's helpful. And then just in a similar kind of vein, is there any other affiliate like Western that is not on a profit share as you go through this integration? Or are there other integrations of smaller affiliates or recent deals that could be part of that improvement in efficiency? Jenny Johnson : The only one that is -- Matt, you could talk about the financial impact, but the only one that still, first of all, the ALTs [ph] managers, you don\u2019t get the same kind of scale by integration. The legal department in the ALTs [ph] manager is a deal team, not usually sort of a 40-act kind of team. And so there is not -- those are really pretty standalone. As far as the traditional managers, Royce is still pretty independent and runs a lot of their own operations, but they're really the last one. All the others, they all look a little bit different but have had, either have been integrated or at various levels of integration that's happening. Matt Nicholls : Yes, look, when we acquired Legg Mason, we quite purposely agreed to various levels of autonomy over set periods of time because it's not possible to integrate and consolidate operations in a quick, methodical way that we believe is safe and sound. So, essentially, we had a set timeline over a period of 5 years over which these various operational scale initiatives were planned. At the end of the day, Western was the last one on the list because they're so big and scaled themselves with their own autonomous, independent operation. That's the way it worked. However, looking forward, you could think of our company in a much more simplistic way. On the public market side, we're going to have one scaled operation supporting a series of investment teams, some of which have their own brands because they're synonymous with a certain style of investing and what our clients demand from us. And then the second part of the company is the alternative asset businesses that require very specialized operations to support them. And so that's basically the way to look at it. You have the liquid sort of public markets business on the one hand, enjoying the scaled operation on a global level, and then you have the alternative asset groups on the other. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Cypress from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about Putnam. I think it's been about a year since you guys have closed the transaction there. I was hoping maybe you could just update us on the progress, the synergies there, the flow picture seems to be perhaps a lot better than people may have thought, perhaps [indiscernible] as well. So just curious if you could update us on that as well as the strategic partnership that you have with Great-West and the scope for additional growth and flows there. Matt Nicholls : Yes, why don't I do the first one, then Jenny and Adam will do the partnership with Great-West Life. I mean, I'll say it's not very often when you say an asset management land when you do strategic transactions, they're quite complicated. Human capital issues happen and you do your best when you enter into transactions and it's never perfect by any stretch. But the partner acquisition for us has really been like the definition of a home run in many ways, both in terms of flows. The flow trajectory has been very significant. I think for the 12 months since we closed the transaction, I think the net new flows excluding reinvested dividends is something like $15 billion approximately, and that's not the exact number, it's $12 billion, $15 billion. It's been a $1 billion a month pretty much, net new flows. The performance has been outstanding. The team and the team fit culturally, importantly, has been a very good fit with the rest of Franklin and culturally they're an incredibly disciplined team that have been through a lot together and it meshed very, very well with Franklin. And it's sort of a great combination where you've got an example of where when you've got something that really performs well, with a team that's gelled well together, combined with very powerful global distribution, what those two things, when they come together, can create, that's what we've done. In terms of the financial impact of the transaction, we had announced about 100, we were going to go from pretty much zero margin to 30% margin, which would have been $150 million of operating income on a 12-month level. We're certainly a little bit ahead of that. We're probably $25 million or more ahead of that, $175 million, $180 million. Obviously, we're not reporting independent teams this way, but obviously, it's only been 12 months, so we can -- little bit more, so we can give you that context. So we're delighted with the team, delighted with the performance, and very pleased both financially and how it's worked for our customers and from a distribution and product perspective. But Adam and Jenny, I think you want to comment on the rest of it. Adam Spector : Yes. Thank you. I would say that the great thing about Putnam is it shows really what can happen when we bring in a tremendous investment team that didn't necessarily have scaled distribution together with scaled distribution. And that's really what's happened. Their performance has remained really, really quite good. I think they have 89% outperforming in the 1-year, 91, 89, and 90, with 87% of their assets four stars or better. So, really strong performance. But with scaled distribution, if you take a look at this quarter versus a year ago, gross is up over 2x and their net is up over 7x and they had $13.6 billion of flow in the first quarter. So just really strong results. The core sales there is also what's really important. If we take a look how much the regular sales and mutual fund sales are growing, that's what's driving things significantly. You also asked, I think, about the partnership with the Power Group. That's going quite well. We have a deep, embedded relationship with Empower where we're building some new products together and seeing significant interest generated in some smaller plan retirement products. We are beginning to build out with them outside of the U.S. We have a good general account relationship. And then the other thing that Putnam really brought us was significant expertise in the retirement channel where we have a very scaled team who specialize in retirement, but importantly, also the right retirement products now with the a target date suite that's about $18 billion, and a stable value product that's about $17 billion with really stellar performance. Matt Nicholls : And I think -- sorry, one other thing we should have added, and I know Jenny's going to comment on the Great West Life, the broader relationship, is it's not just about the -- Putnam has been terrific, but it's also helped with our work and strategic work around our other key teams in equities, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Mutual Series, ClearBridge, these are all tremendous teams in and of themselves. And while they operate autonomously, because we don't want to interfere with the various styles of investing, there's a benefit internally of sharing success stories and how things are working, how we can do better overall as a company across the firm, widely speaking, certainly, and how we get access to meetings and things like that with various high profile companies and such. So I think that's also a benefit to the company. Jenny Johnson : Yes, and I'll just say, look, it's a reminder that if you -- we always talk about there's 3x the money in motion across active managers than going into passive. If you're a good performing active -- a top-performing active manager, you're going to see flows, and they've just demonstrated that, number one. Number two, when you have moments like DeepSeek, it reminds you why diversification matters and you're seeing more and more people on the institutional side talk about a desire to get back into more active management. And so that's important. And then just two other points. As Adam talked about the growth sales and the benefits of true scale, that since the acquisition, Putnam's quarterly growth sales are up 68%, just to emphasize that number. And then it is not just in their open and mutual funds, it's a diverse across all vehicles, including their ETF has had great flows as well. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks so much for the color there and congrats on the success with Putnam. Jenny Johnson : Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bill Katz from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. I just want to clarify the guidance on expenses. Just, Matt, if you could just reiterate the '26, what I think I heard was you'd be flat to '25 if you strip out market action, performance fees, and pre-synergies. And so that would be an incremental 2 to 2.50 down. A, is that correct? And then against that, what is the revenue contribution you're assuming for WAMCO? You mentioned, I think, about 6% residual exposure on the website. Are you assuming zero contribution or some component of that? Thank you. Matt Nicholls : No, certainly not zero. But we're not going to also estimate where we see the 6% going. We're obviously working very hard with Western and its clients. They're working very hard with their clients on their current business, which is diversified across multiple fixed income strategies. Obviously, what we're going to do, as we've committed to do with you as a community and obviously with our investors, is to make sure we're transparent as much as we can in terms of the progress we're making. Each month when we highlight our AUM, we will include a summary and an update on Western, so you'll be able to see what direction that 6% is going in. We've given you the effective fee rate, so you'll be able to calculate it on a month-to-month basis as we progress through the situation. You were right on the expense guidance. It is -- think about the guide for 2025 being roughly flat, excluding performance fees, because you don't know where performance fees are going to be, obviously, in 2025. So normalize it. Performance fees and the extra quarter of Putnam, and then minus $250 million from that -- $200 million to $250 million from that to get to the margin expansion that we expect. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you. Matt Nicholls : Thanks, Bill. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Matthew, I'd just like to ask about that last point you just made, the $200 million to $250 million, is that coming out of the full year and will that ramp through the year? Yes, okay. Matt Nicholls : Yes, so we expect -- by run rate, what I meant is on day one of our fiscal 2026. We expect to be in a position where we are achieving those expense reductions for the full year 2026. So by the time we get to the end of 2026, we expect expenses to be lower by that amount, $200 million to $250 million. And obviously as we work through 2025, we will provide you with updates on that. So that's what we expect for 2026. Brennan Hawken : Okay. So, the $200 million to $250 million is the exit rate of the fiscal year '26, and we'll see the progress of that through the year of 2026. Matt Nicholls : Yes, but by the time you get to the end of 2026, it will be $200 million, $250 million lower expenses versus 2025. Brennan Hawken : On a run rate basis. Matt Nicholls : That's the way you should look at it, yes. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. So then just two more related sort of to clarify. If you could, please, maybe I know you said flat for the full year, but if you could maybe clarify, starting point and what number we should be thinking about. And then it's my sense that this is rather large, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Western. So is this a -- these efficiency efforts, do they transcend the whole organization, or are they focused in any particular areas? Matt Nicholls : So on that front, then I'll give -- I think you're asking for quarterly guidance. I'll give you that, too, in a second, because I want to make sure that you have the updates for the quarter. It transcends more than just Western. We're taking this as an opportunity to review the overall company. We were frankly already doing that, as we've announced, and as you're used to us doing each year. For example, in the last 12 months, we've added almost 1,000 people to Franklin and because, obviously, through a major acquisition. And we've also invested heavily in new sales efforts across, we now have 90 people in alternative asset management, wealth management channel coverage, for example. We have dozens of new sales people in ETFs, specialized sales force. We've added significant resources across our distribution, this is why I think you're seeing the increase in sales across the organization. While we've done that, the reason why our expenses have remained under control is because or remained relatively flat is because we're taking expenses out on a continuous effort to manage our margin as best we can. Now, sometimes you're going to go through some courses where it's a bit lower and then we expect it to go higher, which is why we provided the 5-year look because that's where we see things going when we're out 5 years. But I think we haven't witnessed in this industry as much strategic dialogue and change going on within just asset management in years. And we're right at the forefront of that. We are doing our very best to invest heavily in the business but while retaining the best margin we can get. So I'd say in terms of the $250 million, I agree with you, it's a large number and a lot of effort, but it is across an expense of $4.7 or so billion or so, so that\u2019s -- and $5 billion if you include all the performance fees and such. So, it's a meaningful reduction, but you've got to look at it across the overall firm. In terms of the quarterly guidance, we expect our effective fee rate to be in the mid to high 37s. The reason for that is that we expect inflows into higher fee strategies to offset lower fee outflows that we expect. So we expect an uptick from the low 37s to the mid-high 37s. Compensation of benefits we expect to be $815 million to $820 million for the quarter. That assumes $50 million in performance fees and about a $10 million catch-up on base salaries and 401-K, because we do that back to January in terms of the inflationary-driven compensation increases. Information systems and technology, we expect that to remain at $150 million. That's notwithstanding the announcements we've made around Aladdin, which is all going on track. Occupancy, we expect to be between $70 million and $75 million, probably on the lower end of that. We're starting to see a reduction in the double rent that we've talked about. Most of the firm in New York has now moved into our new offices within New York City, which is the whole unification project that we talked to you about, and we've been paying double rent for a period of time. And that's starting to drop off. It'll fully drop off in later years, but most of it will be gone by the time we get to 2026. G&A will be a bit higher. It'll be around $190 million. And that's due to the fact we're investing more in advertising and we've got higher legal expenses associated mostly with the Western matter. And then from a tax perspective, we expect to be between 25% and 27% for the year. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that clarity. Matt Nicholls : Thank you, Brennan. Operator : The next question is from Ben Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Budish : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe moving over to the Alternative side, during the prepared remarks, Jenny, you talked about wealth fundraising growing to 20% to 30% of total capital raises. I'm just curious, how do you see that unfolding? What's the sort of cadence? It sounds like you've obviously talked about investing a lot in distribution. There are new products in the market. Is this predicated on more sort of semi-liquid democratized vehicles or retail participation in drawdown funds? So just curious if you could provide some more color on those expectations. Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Sure, I'll start and then Adam, feel free to add in. So, remember when Lexington raised Fund 10, which they closed at I think $22.7 billion, 20% of it came from the wealth channel. So we've demonstrated the ability to actually, even on the traditional types of vehicles to actually be pretty successful in the wealth channel. And again, that was years of working to build out and learning. I think the good news is our DNA actually is in the wealth channel, and so learning actually how to then bring alternatives And today we have 90 people who are just dedicated to Alternatives in wealth kind of across the globe to support all our distribution teams. And then most recently, so we -- I think I mentioned in the opening remarks, the three, we call them like cornerstone perpetual products. And so, we have three perpetual products that cover real estate debt, secondaries and just real estate equity that are almost a $1 billion. In January, we had a period of time of kind of fundraising, but I'm not sure the word's closed, but sort of had our first, we raised funds with a couple of partners and had a secondary perpetual fund. So we first launched it. We had to cap it at $900 million. It actually could have been bigger because the difference between the institutional channel and the wealth channel, the institutional channel you can call capital as you need it and the wealth channel people make investments. And we were concerned about cash drag. We wanted to be respectful of the pace in which we could do the secondary deals. And so that fund will continue to fundraise this quarter. So in January, it raised $900 million. So that was actually accumulation of a couple of months, but $900 million. And this quarter it will continue to open up and raise. Now we've also launched that on the international side. It would not surprise us if that, on the international side, the first raise is similar to what we are able to do in the U.S. So it just shows the kind of, one, when you bring the right products to the market in the wealth channel, there's a tremendous amount of interest there. And then two, you have the skills around experts that can support your distribution teams, thought leadership, our Franklin Templeton Academy, which educates advisors on how to think about alternatives in their portfolios. And then I think much further off, but I think it's a very real opportunity, is in the retirement channel. We have launched a couple of products there, one of which we're doing with Apollo that has both real estate and some private credit in it. We have some of our own CITs. The reality is the retirement channel is going to be slow to have penetration. It's actually the best place because you get natural cash flows in, so it deals with some of the illiquidity nature of these vehicles. But because it's an incredibly litigious space, because it's so focused on fees, and I will say, the top performing ALTs managers aren't on sale, and you don't want to put the lower performing ones in because you'd be better off in the liquid markets than a poor performing ALTs manager. And then finally, the infrastructure of the retirement platforms actually aren't fully ready to deal with the nature of this. But it's a massive opportunity that we see that will over time open up because I think there's a real desire to be able to bring this through to the retirement channel. Adam, you want to add anything to that? Adam Spector : Sure. I would add a few things. To your point about draw downs versus perpetual, we think they both play a place in the wealth management channel, and there's a difference between a regional broker-dealer and a large global private bank. So, we'll see different products play different roles. But the fact is, as Jenny said, we now have three scale, the perpetual vehicles that are each roughly about a $1 billion in the private debt space, in the real estate and in the secondary space. That allows us to constantly be in market, talking to our partners. That puts us in a very different position and allows us to be more effective when we do come to market with the drawdown fund. And as she said, we're doing that not just in the U.S., but in EMEA, in the Middle East, in Asia, and seeing success around the world. We've also invested significantly, not only in the 90 people in that team that's focused on selling, but also in our educational resources. And we find that the more time we spend educating people on the benefits of Alternatives, the better off we are. We also think that as we grow in Alternatives, we want to make sure that we can service that business well. So again, one of the things we've been doing is cutting expenses where we can. We've reinvested in building out an investor services team so that we can make sure that we really service all the business as it's coming in. We're finally, I would say, working better with major distributors to co-develop products. So instead of launching a product on our own, we're bringing it with a major partner at scale at the right time on their calendar, and we're planning those launches a year in advance, and that's helped us tremendously as well. Jenny Johnson : And you didn't ask the question, but I'll throw in just, we are reiterating we had given guidance last quarter that we thought we'd raise $13 billion to $20 billion in Alternatives this year, and that the higher end was dependent on Lexington's Fund 11 basically having its first close in September. So just to give an update on that, Lexington Fund 10 has committed 75% of their funds, and that's usually kind of a trigger when you start thinking about the next fund. They would anticipate a first close sometime in the fall. Again, if it happens in September, it happens in this year, if it happens October or November, it falls into next year. And so that's where it's dependent kind of on whether we hit that higher range of $20 billion. This quarter, we raised $6 billion Alternatives. Of that $6 billion, $4.3 billion was in private markets. So that's the part that is counted towards the $13 billion to $20 billion range. And again, that does not include that $900 million that was raised in Lexington because that will be counted this quarter, $900 million in the perpetual. Benjamin Budish : All right. Appreciate all the responses. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning, everyone. Matt Nicholls : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Davitt : If I remember correctly, I don't think you include VA [ph] wins, insurance VA wins in your unfunded balance. And there were a few very large reported VA wins that I think funded in the quarter. Could you give us an idea of how much that added to the quarterly flows? And secondly, if there's still more to come from those wins, and then higher level, it seems that most of the large active managers in our coverage have been losing large VA mandates. So, maybe give some high-level thoughts on why you think Franklin is bucking that trend. Thank you. Jenny Johnson : Well, I think you probably refer -- go ahead, Adam. Sorry, go ahead. Adam Spector : I was just saying, in general, one of the things we're trying to do is to become a more important partner to fewer players. And I think that's true, Patrick, in every segment we serve, whether it's DB, DC, insurance. And a number of the wins we've had have come from significantly expanded relationships with insurance companies who have multiple managers, and they might have several dozen managers and they want to shrink that to maybe three, four, five or six managers, but they need to do that with a firm that can cover all of the major asset classes and support them in the field and sell. There are very few firms who can do that with the right expertise. We're one of them. So when we see that consolidation, we tend to be on the winning side of it. It was definitely true this quarter, and we've got a number of similar conversations in place right now, and that's very much part of our strategy is to win in those consolidation deals. Jenny Johnson : And I think the big one, Adam, was venerable, and I'm trying to remember, did it fund this quarter, or I think it was September or October, but yes, that has funded, but we continue to have more conversations with these partners. And there's a couple others that we haven't disclosed the details about potentially, as Adam said, doing more, because they are trying to reduce the number of firms that they work with and requiring more of those firms. So they want a breadth of capability. They want education. They want -- so things like our academy become very important in this space. And they like the expertise, specific expertise on insurance. So we think there'll be more to come there. Patrick Davitt : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, Franklin's President and CEO for final comments. Jenny Johnson : Well, I just want to thank everybody for attending the call. And, again, we're a people business. We're only as good as our folks at Franklin Templeton who work hard every day to serve our clients. And so I just want to thank them for all their hard work and dedication. And we look forward to speaking with all of you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",
